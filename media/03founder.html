            <strong>His  Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</strong>
            <p><span id="Frame1" dir="LTR"><em>He  	was a genuine holy person with enormous integrity and compassion,  	and he had a powerful impact on those who met him. He never claimed  	authority and respect for himself; what he said and did was always  	in the name of Krishna...</em></p>
<p>  	Dr. Thomas J. Hopkins</p>
<p>When  His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada entered  the port of New York City on September 17, 1965, few Americans took  notice &mdash; but he was not merely another immigrant.  He was on a  mission to introduce an ancient religion, which originated in India,  into mainstream America.  Before Srila Prabhupada passed away on  November 14, 1977, at the age of 81, his mission proved successful.   He had founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness  (ISKCON) and saw it grow into a worldwide confederation of more than  100 temples, ashrams and cultural centers.</p>
<p> Srila  Prabhupada was born Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, to a pious  Hindu family in Calcutta.  As a youth growing up in  British-controlled India, Abhay became involved with Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s  civil disobedience movement to secure independence for his nation. It  was, however, a 1922 meeting with a prominent scholar and religious  leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, which proved most  influential on Abhay&rsquo;s future calling. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a  leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava denomination, a monotheistic  tradition within the broad Hindu culture, and asked Abhay to bring  the teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world. Abhay  became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to  carry out his mentor&rsquo;s request. Abhay, later known by the honorific  A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, spent the next 32 years  preparing for his journey west.</p>
<p> In  1965, at the age of sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada traveled to New York  City aboard a cargo ship.  The journey was treacherous, and the  elderly spiritual teacher suffered two heart attacks aboard ship.  Arriving in the United States with just seven dollars in Indian  rupees and his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, Srila  Prabhupada began to share the timeless wisdom of Krishna  consciousness.  His message of peace and goodwill resonated with many  young people, some of whom came forward to become serious students of  the Krishna tradition.  With the help of these students, Srila  Prabhupada rented a small storefront on New York&rsquo;s Lower East Side  to use as a temple.  On July 11, 1966, he officially registered his  organization in the state of New York, formally founding the  International Society for Krishna Consciousness.</p>
<p> In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe  14 times on lecture tours, bringing the teachings of Lord Krishna to  thousands of people on six continents.  Men and women from all  backgrounds and walks of life came forward to accept his message, and  with their help, Srila Prabhupada established ISKCON centers and  projects throughout the world.  Under his inspiration, Krishna  devotees established temples, rural communities, educational  institutions, and started what would become the world&rsquo;s largest  vegetarian food relief program.    With the desire to nourish the  roots of Krishna consciousness in its home, Srila Prabhupada returned  to India several times, where he sparked a revival in the Vaishnava  tradition.  In India, he opened dozens of temples, including large  centers in the holy towns of Vrindavana and Mayapur.</p>
<p> Srila  Prabhupada's most significant contributions, perhaps, are his books.   He authored over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition, which are  highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, fidelity to  the tradition, and clarity.  Several of his works are used as  textbooks in numerous college courses.  His writings have been  translated into 76 languages. His most prominent works include: <em>Bhagavad-gita As It Is,</em> the 30-volume <em>Srimad-Bhagavatam</em>,  and the 17-volume <em>Sri Caitanya-caritamrita</em>.</p>
