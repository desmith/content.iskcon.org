</p>
<p> With  roots in the traditions of ancient India, the Hare Krishna movement  finds expression in vibrant colors, striking melodies, mouth-watering  culinary creations, and joyous festivals&mdash;all with glorification of  Krishna, or God, in the center.  Here are a few of the ways in  members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness  (ISKCON) convey their devotion through the arts:</p>
<h2> <strong>Music  	and Dance</strong></h2>
    <p> Tradition  holds that in Lord Krishna&rsquo;s abode &ldquo;every word is a song and  every step is a dance.&rdquo;  Music plays a key role in the lives of  Krishna devotees. When Srila Prabhupada first brought the Krishna  tradition West in 1965, he introduced the art of <em>kirtan</em>,  devotional chanting accompanied by traditional Indian instruments.   ISKCON devotees have shared this dynamic musical expression with the  world, and many have gone on to become accomplished singers and  musicians. Hare Krishna temples also regularly host stage  performances and teach classes, highlighting classical Indian dance  forms, such as <em>Bharata Natyam, Kathak, </em>and <em>Odissi</em>.   These intricate and graceful performances are part of a rich  tradition of depicting the divine activities of God or His devotees  through dance.</p>

    <h2> <strong>Fine  	Art</strong></h2>
    <p> Artists  within the Hare Krishna movement have created hundreds of original  paintings depicting Lord Krishna and His spiritual abode.  With their  characteristic blend of Eastern and Western styles, these works of  art illustrate multiple volumes of books, decorate ISKCON temples,  and help to visually present the Krishna tradition. </p>

    <h2> <strong>Architecture </strong> </h2>
    <p> Many  ISKCON temples throughout the world are splendid examples of  traditional and neo-Vedic architecture.  In Spanish Fork, Utah, the  ISKCON temple is modeled after a 15th Century North Indian  palace, and boasts elaborately designed arches, columns, verandahs,  and waterfalls.  In West Virginia, Krishna devotees built a  gold-domed temple that was penned &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Taj Mahal&rdquo; by the  New York Times.  ISKCON has also erected dozens of temples in India  which employ classic architectural styles, in major cities such as  New Delhi and Mumbai, as well as in sacred pilgrimage towns such as  Vrindavana and Mayapur. </p>

    <h2> <strong>Worship  	Services </strong> </h2>
  <p> Members  and guests are drawn by the authenticity and vibrancy of ISKCON  worship services. Krishna theology teaches that all the senses should  be engaged in the glorification of God.  Thus, upon entering an  ISKCON worship service, a visitor&rsquo;s eyes feast on an elaborately  decorated altar; her ears are entreated by melodious chanting; her  nose embraces fragrant flowers and incense; and her mouth savors  sanctified delicious vegetarian food. </p>
<LI>
    <h2> <strong>Holidays  	and Festivals</strong></h2>
  <p> Commemorating  sacred days of the Vaishnava calendar, the Hare Krishna movement  hosts colorful and exciting festivals that draw thousands of guests  and worshippers.  Holidays such as Janamastami (Krishna&rsquo;s birth  anniversary) and Diwali (the New Year) are observed with great  revelry and joy.  Perhaps the most famous public festival, called  Ratha Yatra, or &ldquo;Festival of the Chariots,&rdquo; is celebrated  annually in major cities of the world, including marches down New  York&rsquo;s Fifth Avenue, the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles, and  Independence Avenue in Washington, D.C. Patterned after a  millennia-old festival held in the Indian city of Jagannath Puri, the  fete includes the pulling of ornately decorated 40-foot high  chariots.</p>
<p>  <strong>Food</strong> </p>
<p> Sometimes  referred to as &ldquo;the kitchen religion,&rdquo; ISKCON temples offer  visitors delicious sanctified vegetarian food, and host weekly Sunday  open house programs that culminate in a free multi-course feast.  The  internationally inspired menu can range from Punjabi curried  vegetables to eggplant parmesan.  To better acquaint people with the  benefits of a vegetarian diet, the Krishna movement has also  established 100 vegetarian restaurants around the world. </p>
<h2 LANG="" ALIGN="left"><strong>Literature</strong></h2>
<p> With  an aim to shed light on the profound philosophy underlying these  cultural expressions, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT), ISKCON&rsquo;s  affiliated publishing house, has printed and distributed more than  400 million books and magazines.  These publications often contain  translations from Sanskrit or Bengali, reproductions of rare  commentaries, and attractive original illustrations and photographs.   Said to be the world&rsquo;s largest publisher of classic Vaishnava  texts, the BBT is renowned as an excellent resource for the study of  Indian culture and philosophy. </p>
