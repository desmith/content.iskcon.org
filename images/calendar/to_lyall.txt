Here's what I have done so far.

I have no parampara files.

The ftp details for iskcon-london.com are:
Host/name: 217.199.169.113
User Id: iskcon
Pass: krishna

You have to navigate up two levels and then to dir web
- you'll see the directory called dev that I've beeen using.

I will look at the home page over the next couple of days
- other than that I await instruction ...
pkd
