              </a></p>
            <p>Some years ago, I sat on a committee that had been meeting monthly 
              for several years.  During one meeting I happened to glance at my 
              watch.  It was 2.30 p.m.. What seemed like an hour later I looked 
              at it again. It said 2.45 p.m. I reflected that this was my life 
              ticking away. The committee had made no decisions and had the same 
              agenda each time we met.  So I got up, made my apologies, walked 
              out and handed in my resignation from my job. That was the beginning 
              of the most creative and fruitful period of my professional life.</p>
            <p> I tell this (true) story because it illustrates my feelings about 
              many meetings. They are wasteful of time and energy, they are boring 
              and they achieve very little. Yet meetings are the lifeblood of 
              organisations. So how can they be improved so that they become interesting, 
              productive and worthwhile?</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Why have meetings?</p>
            <p>Meetings, as opposed to social gatherings or teaching situations 
              (seminars, workshops, etc.), have two functions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To present information which cannot be transmitted by other 
                means, e.g. memos, newsletters or on a one-to-one basis. Such 
                briefing meetings can be short, since participation need be concerned 
                only with questions of clarification. The great advantage of such 
                meetings is that information can be disseminated quickly to a 
                large number of people with the assurance that it has been received.  
              </li>
              <li>To make decisions. This is the major reason for meetings. Although 
                decisions can be made unilaterally, participation is a feature 
                of effective management because it enables the whole creativity 
                of the organisation to be utilised, it motivates staff by giving 
                them a share in management processes and it develops skills which 
                are applicable in other fields of management.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So if you have no worthwhile information to impart to a large number 
              of people, or have no decisions to make, don't hold meetings.    
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Briefing meetings</p>
            <p>Information needs to be disseminated, although it is my belief 
              that far too much information flows in many organisations leading 
              to information overload, where members are inundated with paper 
              or where the same statistical information is requested from a number 
              of different sources. Such 'infomania' can lead to staff ignoring 
              important information in the welter of useless material which lands 
              on their desks, in their pigeon-holes or on their computers.   </p>
            <p> Take a long, hard look at the amount of information which flows 
              within your organisation and:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Decide which is essential &#8213; all the rest can be deleted. 
              </li>
              <li>Decide who needs to know and circulate only to them. A copy 
                can be posted somewhere for the remainder of the staff to read 
                if they wish. Stop sending everything to everybody. </li>
              <li>Put someone in charge of communications with the power to co-ordinate 
                requests for information.   Charge that person with reducing such 
                requests to a minimum. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Where important information needs to be disseminated to a large 
              number of people, briefing meetings are an excellent way of ensuring 
              that staff receive information and, since they can ask questions, 
              understand it.  For the most part, these meetings should be short 
              and frequent, and some organisations have a daily meeting of just 
              ten minutes or so for this purpose.   </p>
            <p> Where more complex matters are concerned, e.g. explanation of 
              policy decisions, clearly there must be longer sessions but they 
              should also be structured differently.  An excellent arrangement 
              is to provide each member with a short paper digest of essential 
              information prior to the meeting, to deliver the information orally 
              in order to explain / emphasise important points, then to allow 
              the audience to discuss it in small groups prior to a question and 
              answer session in which queries and comments can be received.  </p>
            <p> Briefing sessions are largely one-way channels to disseminate 
              material which has already been agreed and, although there should 
              be opportunity for feedback from the audience, it is a sign of bad 
              management if such feedback contains any ideas not already solicited 
              in the decision-making process.  The need for discussion is therefore 
              limited, and briefing sessions should not become prolonged or disputative 
              if management has done its job of consultation properly.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"> To summarise:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>For day-to-day matters, hold regular short briefing sessions 
                daily or weekly.  Confine your agenda to matters of fact, e.g. 
                calendar items, updating statistical matter, requests for information. 
              </li>
              <li>Important policy matters are best dealt with in business meetings 
                (see below), but it is wise to involve staff in consultation; 
                for example, by circulating formative documents and seeking written 
                responses from individuals or groups.   </li>
              <li>When decisions have been finalised, circulate them to all staff, 
                either individually or through their constituency groups, in advance 
                of a briefing meeting. </li>
              <li>At a briefing meeting, briefly outline the <i>raison d'etre</i> 
                of the decisions and possibly arrange small-group discussion before 
                answering any questions and responding to comments. </li>
              <li>Do not enter into any debate &#8213; this should have preceded 
                the meeting.    </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Business meetings</p>
            <p>The<b> </b>purpose of business meetings is to make decisions. If 
              you do not have a decision to make, don't hold a meeting.</p>
            <p> Decisions are choices between alternative solutions to a problem. 
              The process of decision-making is therefore something like this:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Know your problem. This appears to be self-evident, yet I frequently 
                encounter organisations  that have restricted their awareness 
                of their problems by making assumptions or by jumping to conclusions; 
                for example, one was concerned that their interpersonal relations 
                were poor when, in reality, the problem was that they were not 
                getting the results they wanted and the reasons went far beyond 
                interpersonal relations. Problems lie in the results you are getting, 
                so start there and identify what you are dissatisfied with. </li>
              <li>Collect all the information you can about the unsatisfactory 
                results you are getting. At this stage many people start jumping 
                in with their own explanations, so discipline yourself to avoid 
                that and to focus on a realistic and comprehensive examination 
                of the <u>facts</u> concerning the problem. It is tempting to 
                ignore facts which are critical of oneself or of the organisation 
                itself, and a sign of a sick organisation is its unwillingness 
                to accept its own weaknesses. One solution is to seek the opinions 
                of those outside the organisation, who are more objective and 
                therefore more honest. </li>
              <li>Brainstorm all possible solutions to the problem. Brainstorming 
                is only successful, however, if the participants free their unconscious 
                minds and feel able, without criticism, to generate as many solutions 
                as possible, however absurd some of them may appear. In my experience, 
                some of the most bizarre solutions have proved to have considerable 
                value.  So observe the golden rules of brainstorming &#8213; no 
                comment (including laughter) and no discussion until all possible 
                solutions have been recorded. </li>
              <li>Decide which solution is the 'best fit',  remembering that there 
                is no perfect solution, and have the courage to implement it. 
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Such a process requires a format which differs from many of the 
              meetings I observe in organisations, where the purpose seems to 
              be to talk about problems rather than to generate solutions.  To 
              be successful, a business meeting needs:</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">There needs to be an appropriate agenda</p>
            <p>The agenda should be published sufficiently far in advance of the 
              meeting and contain sufficient information for all participants 
              to be able to consider how they can best contribute to success.  
              It should also:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> State the venue of the meeting and its starting and ending 
                times, which should be strictly adhered to.   Never have an open-ended 
                meeting, which only encourages people to waste time. </li>
              <li>Have only sufficient business for the time available, which 
                may mean postponing non-essential items to a later meeting.  Such 
                editing implies the existence of a body (often called a 'steering 
                committee') authorised to select items for the agenda. </li>
              <li>Contain all the business to be considered, i.e. there should 
                be no item labelled 'Any Other Business' (A.O.B). as it does not 
                allow members time to consider the issues raised and can cause 
                rushed, and therefore ill-considered, decisions to be made. </li>
              <li>Contain only proposals for decision-making, i.e all items should 
                be capable of ending with a definite decision being made. This 
                requires a firm statement of proposed action, e.g. 'It is proposed 
                that a Congregational Council be established with the following 
                functions and structures ... .'  Each proposal should state who 
                will introduce the item. </li>
              <li>Every proposal needs to be supported by a paper setting out 
                its main recommendations and a <i>raison d'etre</i>, which should 
                be concise (no more than two sides of A4 paper) yet comprehensive, 
                i.e. it should hide no essential information. Such papers should 
                be circulated to all committee members in sufficient time to allow 
                them to read them and consider their response prior to the meeting. 
              </li>
              <li>Have a short item for information-giving to allow urgent notices 
                to be presented. These briefing items should allow time for questions 
                but no discussion. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">There needs to be an agreed procedure </p>
            <p>Meetings need to be disciplined if they are to achieve their ends 
              economically and harmoniously, and an agreed procedure is essential 
              to this.   The most important aspects are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>It is absolutely essential that meetings should be conducted 
                in a manner which encourages the utilisation of the total creativity 
                of the group, and this can only be achieved if members feel secure 
                in contributing their honestly-held beliefs. In order for this 
                to happen, the group needs to establish norms of behaviour which 
                enable efficient but caring conduct of business. Norms cannot 
                be imposed &#8213; they can only be agreed. However, here are 
                some suggestions for discussion:<br>
                *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the 
                purposes of the meeting only, all members have the same rights 
                and responsibilities, regardless of their status within the organisation. 
                If the senior manager is concerned that decisions might be made 
                for which (s)he cannot accept responsibility and accountability, 
                it should be made clear that (s)he has the right to veto such 
                decisions. ·<br>
                * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the contributions 
                of individual members will not be referred to outside the meeting 
                place except with the member's agreement, or where the contribution 
                is minuted. This is important to safeguard free speech without 
                recrimination.<br>
                *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all contributions 
                are valued, even if disagreed wth. They will be listened to and 
                responded to, if only by the chairperson.<br>
                *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; members 
                will not interrupt each other.<br>
                *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; members 
                will exercise restraint in the length of their contributions and 
                will accept the chairperson's ruling on this. <br>
                * Once norms are agreed, all members should pledge to support 
                them and to draw attention to any breach. </li>
              <li>Meetings should start and finish promptly. My experience is 
                that starting a meeting on time, with several members missing 
                is an excellent way of impressing the need for punctuality. Similarly, 
                to end on time impresses the need to avoid wasting time &#8213; 
                a major source of dissatisfaction in most of the meetings I have 
                attended. </li>
              <li>No time should be allowed for members to read documents. These 
                should have been issued with the agenda and, if some members have 
                not bothered to read them, they, and not their more conscientious 
                colleagues, should be at a disadvantage. </li>
              <li>The most important items should be at the top of the agenda, 
                but there needs to be a timetable which allows all items to be 
                covered in the time allocated.  Some published indication of how 
                long each item is allowed is helpful so long as the chairperson 
                is  effective in timekeeping, but one needs to be flexible so 
                as to avoid depriving members of adequate time to reach wise decisions. 
                A more realistic device is to recognise that each item will almost 
                certainly take longer than planned and to restrict the number 
                of agenda items:  if the meeting finishes early as a result, nobody 
                will complain! </li>
              <li>Each item should have the supporting paper mentioned above, 
                and since all members will have seen it in advance,  it need only 
                be briefly introduced. Time should be allocated for questions 
                of a factual nature, i.e., for clarification, and then the matter 
                should be opened for discussion. </li>
              <li>Flexibility is a great virtue in organising meetings, and you 
                should not be afraid to vary the format, e.g. if the meeting is 
                of a committee or working party charged with producing a discussion 
                document for a larger constituency, such as a senior management 
                team or even the whole staff, it may need to explore a range of 
                possibilities before formulating a policy recommendation:  in 
                such a case it would be advisable to use at least part of the 
                time available for brainstorming, as outlined in the previous 
                section.   </li>
              <li>Some limit on the length and frequency of contributions is helpful. 
                I once participated in an exercise where each member of a committee 
                was given tokens with which they 'bought' speaking time; when 
                their tokens were all spent they could no longer participate. 
                Some members ran out early and could not contribute to items they 
                desperately wanted to influence &#8213; it was a very powerful 
                lesson in the need for self-discipline, and they were noticeably 
                less dominating thereafter.  This was an extreme measure, however, 
                and it is better to agree simple rules, such as each member can 
                make only two contributions to a debate on any agenda item, or 
                that no member shall speak for more than three minutes to an agenda 
                item. Strong chairing of the meeting is, however, the most effective 
                means of ensuring economical practice.</li>
              <li>At the end of each item, any decision should be recorded <i>verbatim</i>, 
                together with a statement about who will be responsible for further 
                action and any deadlines they must meet. </li>
              <li>On completion of the business, the meeting should end. If you 
                have managed to finish ahead of time, so much the better; some 
                chairmen feel guilty about such success and try to prolong the 
                meeting!    </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">There need to be follow-up procedures</p>
            <p>When the meeting is over, you will need arrangements for informing 
              staff of any decisions and someone must monitor progress towards 
              implementing these decisions.   To do this, you need:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> Minutes of all decisions made. Do not attempt to record individual 
                contributions to the discussion, since it is very difficult to 
                ensure accuracy and balance and time can be wasted while people 
                challenge the wording. Restrict minutes to an accurate record 
                of the wording of decisions made, persons responsible for action 
                and deadlines to be met.  Minutes must be circulated as soon as 
                possible to all committee members, but it is advisable to post 
                a copy in a convenient place for others to refer to. Some members 
                object to publication of minutes outside the committee, but I 
                believe it is important in the interest of openess and participation. 
              </li>
              <li>Someone who is responsible for ensuring that persons or groups 
                charged with implementing decisions do their work efficiently 
                and effectively.   Where meetings are not frequent, and there 
                are long intervals between them, this is particularly important.</li>
              <li> A place on the agenda of each meeting for reporting progress 
                towards the implementation of decisions made. Such reports can 
                be of very short duration. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The functions of officers</p>
            <p>Any committee needs at least the two offices of chairperson and 
              secretary. Their functions are often  misunderstood, and it is worth 
              examining them here.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubsubhead">Chairperson </p>
            <p>The chairperson<b> </b>should not be, as is often believed, the 
              most powerful member of a committee, i.e. the person with the greatest 
              ability to influence decisions. To give the powers of chairperson 
              to someone with a vested interest in a particular outcome from a 
              meeting is not the best means of ensuring effective participation 
              and it is therefore better to choose a chairperson with limited 
              personal interest in the decisions made but who is effective at 
              co-ordinating the work of others. The work of a chairperson should, 
              therefore, be:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To ensure the economical and effective use of time. To do so 
                means specifying how long the committee has for debating a topic 
                and ensuring that the time is not exceeded. This entails minimising 
                irrelevant contributions, one of the greatest problems of all 
                meetings. </li>
              <li>To ensure fair opportunity for participation. This does not 
                necessarily mean equality, since some members will legitimately 
                have more to say on some topics, but it does mean enabling the 
                participation of all members who have something relevant to contribute.  
                Such helpful procedures imply a concern for people, and a good 
                chairperson will protect inexperienced members, help the less 
                articulate, restrict the over-verbose, encourage the timid and 
                control any aggressive or hurtful behaviour.  </li>
              <li>To help in the orderly transaction of business. This involves 
                such activities as rigorous timekeeping, adjudicating on matters 
                of procedure, summarising progress to date, suggesting means of 
                proceeding and ensuring clarity  in the wording of agreed decisions. 
              </li>

            </ol>
            <p class="maintextsubsubhead">The secretary</p>
            <p>The secretary is there to record minutes, although (s)he may also 
              be given responsibility for providing information on previous decisions, 
              any regulations relating to the topic, etc. S(he) should normally 
              not make any contribution to the debate, and is often, therefore, 
              chosen from administrative staff. It is essential that a secretary 
              is good at accurate recording of decisions and can write succinctly 
              and clearly.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubsubhead">Other members</p>
            <p>Other members play <i>process roles</i> according to their personalities 
              and propensities. It is not the purpose of this article to explore 
              these, but reference might be made to the literature on this topic, 
              e.g. Belbin or Honey.<a href="#_edn1"

            <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>In this article I have tried to indicate means whereby you can 
              improve the quality of your meetings by making them more efficient 
              and productive. The rest is up to you. From now on look critically 
              at all aspects of your committee structures and procedure and cut 
              out waste, pomposity and inefficiency. You may not succeed in making 
              meetings your favourite activity, but at least you can make them 
              worthwhile. Good luck, but remember that a camel is a horse designed 
              by a committee!</p>
