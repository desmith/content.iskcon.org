            Devi Dasi</span></a> 
            <p></p>
            <p><i>Over the last thirty years ISKCON's relationship with the various 
              social environments in which it lives has been greatly affected 
              by its reaction to the needs and concerns of the families of devotees 
              coming from those social environments. In many cases, this reaction 
              was inadequate and non-supportive, leading to misunderstanding, 
              fear, anger and hatred among non-devotee family members. Sometimes 
              these feelings led to organised opposition to ISKCON, primarily 
              seen in the development and support of propaganda labelling ISKCON 
              as a 'sect' or a cult. In the following article, Dhyana-kunda Devi 
              Dasi discusses the responsibilities both ISKCON and individual devotees 
              have in order to uphold family values while maintaining the integrity 
              of ISKCON's mission.</i></p>
            <p>What my mother went through during my teenage years! Single-handedly 
              maintaining the family which included our grandmother, my sister 
              and myself and simultaneously pursuing her professional career, 
              she was always concerned about our future and worked hard to give 
              us a proper education. 'Your most important asset is knowledge,' 
              she used to say, and so at the age of seventeen I was an avid reader 
              and student, but had little social skills and no friends. Then ('Finally!') 
              a boyfriend appeared on the scene, and I enthusiastically threw 
              myself into the new experience. </p>
            <p> What could be more threatening to my bright future? In my mother's 
              mind, all the alarm systems went off, and I soon found myself under 
              home arrest, our meetings strictly forbidden, our mail controlled 
              etc. She didn't understand and she didn't trust me. The war was 
              long and painful. She fought to protect her daughter; I fought, 
              not so much for my boyfriend, but rather for the freedom of choice, 
              without which, any 'bright future' would lose its appeal.</p>
            <p> At the age of eighteen I met some hippies and one summer day they 
              told me about a Krishna farm at the other end of Poland. Out of 
              curiosity I accompanied them there, against my mother's hysterical 
              prohibition. Or maybe because of it! The devotees, their dress and 
              their habits &#8213; it all seemed weird. 'I would rather become 
              a Christian than that!' But I had to admit that the food was fantastic, 
              and the sound of the <i>kirtana</i> reverberated in my memory long 
              afterwards, along with the words of the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
            <p> I returned home three days later. By that time my mother had invented 
              another means of bringing me back to my senses, or under her control 
              ... she kicked me out of the house. I remember her stern figure 
              in the doorway at midnight, and me, standing on the stairs in my 
              hippie dress. Oh, how I wanted to at least have the last word. To 
              tell her something that would leave her speechless. And I found 
              it, 'Hare Krishna!' I blurted out, and triumphantly ran down the 
              stairs.</p>
            <p> If my mother had hoped that I would come back the next morning, 
              contrite and repentant, she couldn't have been more wrong. The hippies 
              took me under their care. Soon I left my home town and took up university 
              studies: psychology, because this was where I hoped to find the 
              meaning of life.</p>
            <p> For the next three years my mother tried to win me back; in vain. 
              No visits, no letters. When she refused to pay for my education, 
              hoping to bring me home in this way, I sued her in court. I grew 
              stronger, she grew weaker. I had my own life at last, but the memory 
              of her remained at the bottom of my heart, like a thorn.</p>
            <p> One December evening, while I sat in my hostel room dejected, 
              reflecting on my existence which seemed to be leading nowhere, a 
              boy appeared in my door with a stack of books. This time everything 
              was different. His words made sense. I was ready.</p>
            <p> Once I took up the practice of Krsna consciousness, everything 
              gradually fell in its proper place. 'I am no longer afraid of my 
              mother!' I discovered one day. Soon another realisation came: I 
              have reasons to be grateful to her &#8213; for my skills, knowledge 
              and character traits which she had helped me to develop. For example, 
              when I met Krishna-ksetra Dasa for first time (I was later to accept 
              him as my spiritual master), I had a wonderful talk with him, in 
              English, which I knew fluently ... thanks to my mother, to her effort 
              to pay for my private lessons, her constant urging against my protests, 
              'Learn it, learn, you will need it in the future!'</p>
            <p> How strange, after so many years, to feel grateful. I felt an 
              inner urge to thank her. Just go and show my gratitude. Give her 
              something. But what did I have to give her?  And won't she just 
              throw me down the stairs? I cooked some <i>halava</i>, took my <i>Gita</i>, 
              prayed to Krsna and went to see her. My legs were shaking when I 
              rang the doorbell. She opened the door and her face broke into a 
              smile of joyful surprise, 'Oh, do come in! You haven't been home 
              for so long!'</p>
            <p> Eating the half-burned halava, I sat there amazed and overwhelmed 
              when suddenly she asked, 'Could you please tell me something about 
              your religion? Your sister told me ... ' She listened attentively 
              and appreciatively.  I was also able to tell her 'I am so grateful 
              to you for my English.'  </p>
            <p> Now she is a friend of Krsna (sympathetic to the movement). She 
              is happy to help me and other devotees. She no longer tries to dictate 
              to me where I should seek happiness. I am in awe of her love and 
              understanding, her ability to forgive and adjust. I am ashamed of 
              my own immaturity and cruelty in the past. Did it have to be such 
              a 'school of hard knocks'?</p>
            <p> In a way, I was lucky. My family war broke out before I took up 
              Krsna consciousness, and it was precisely Krsna consciousness that 
              put an end to it. The bone of contention was a boyfriend, an ordinary 
              life event &#8213; not a foreign, obscure philosophy which makes 
              teenagers secretly mumble incantations to a picture of 'some strange 
              blue man with a flute', or announce to their parents, 'You are not 
              my mother, and I am not Johnny anymore', and find their portrait 
              in the pages of the <i>Bhagavatam</i> amongst illustrations of lower 
              species of life.</p>
            <p> Parents are definitely a special category, but in our books we 
              don't find many practical guidelines on how to deal with them. We 
              can identify the first oppressed and misunderstood young devotee 
              (<i>bhakta)</i> in the person of Prahlada Maharaja, and call his 
              father Hiranyakasipu, the pioneer of the anti-cult movement, with 
              his allies Sanda and Amarka as the first deprogrammers. We meet 
              the four determined celibate students (<i>brahmacaris)</i>, the 
              Kumaras, who boldly refused their father Brahma when asked to beget 
              children. They didn't heed Brahma's anger and they are praised for 
              that. We can laugh at Daksa, so concerned about his family, who 
              cursed Narada Muni, after the sage diverted all of Daksa's sons 
              to the path of self-realisation. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada 
              comments serenely, with a spark of humour, 'Prajapati Daksa cursed 
              Narada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel 
              all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place. 
              In the <i>parampara</i> system from Narada Muni, I have also been 
              cursed. I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents 
              of my young disciples ... ' (SB 6.5.43 purp.)</p>
            <p> In the world of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, right and wrong are easy 
              to distinguish from each other. The supreme obligation is to give 
              up all material ties and set off in search of self-realisation. 
              No one will send the militia to bring you back home because you 
              happen to be a minor. Where are the happy times of Narada and Dhruva, 
              who could simply set out to the forest, forever forgetting all the 
              material attachments, eat dry leaves (no need to ask their parents 
              for a donation), and within days or months have a meeting (<i>darsan)</i> 
              with the Lord? Narada's mother, who kept him tied to herself with 
              the knot of love, was removed from his path by the Lord Himself, 
              as the serpent of time. Dhruva's mother went straight to the spiritual 
              world in a Vaikuntha airplane on the strength of her son's wonderful 
              spiritual achievement.</p>
            <p> Where in the <i>Bhagavatam</i> are these parents who threaten 
              to bring preachers to courts or who harass temple presidents with 
              complaints? What about locking the child in a room with a cutlet, 
              or sending him to a psychiatrist to convert him back to television, 
              free sex and cigarettes? But on the other hand, do we find in the 
              <i>Bhagavatam</i> devotees who, after years of practice, still fall 
              asleep while chanting privately (<i>japa</i>) or attending the temple 
              classes? Who steal temple money? Who join ISKCON, leaving wives 
              and children behind, only to find a new devotee wife in a few years? 
              Like our parents, we have been brought up in a very materialistic 
              and degraded society. By Lord Caitanya's extraordinary mercy, we 
              have begun the process of devotional service but let us not think 
              that we can now become saints without first becoming human beings.</p>
            <p> Country after country, ISKCON worldwide goes through the difficult 
              period of struggle with the anti-cult movement. This seems to be 
              like a childhood disease, something one has to live through in order 
              to gain lifelong immunity. And throughout the world, there is no 
              country where the anti-cult movement is started and maintained by 
              someone other than dissatisfied parents. Because parents do care. 
              They are concerned about their children's welfare, whether the latter 
              consider it a curse or a blessing. As one devotee put it, 'Parents 
              are persons. Persons have relationships with other persons. And 
              some of those persons are influential  ... '</p>
            <p> It would be an over-simplification to think that the reason we 
              should learn how to deal with our parents is merely to avoid trouble 
              for the movement. Pain is usually an indication that one is doing 
              something wrong. Doctors have a saying, 'The cause is more dangerous 
              than the effect'. Generalising, one can say that parents get angry 
              because we don't act properly. If we improve, we can gain more than 
              just a cease-fire. We can develop skills and values important for 
              our personal development. Can our dealings with our parents possibly 
              have any impact on our spiritual life? But most importantly, what 
              about the suffering they go through and how can we help them to 
              overcome their fears about devotees? Ultimately, how can we help 
              them in their spiritual lives?</p>
            <p> How do we see our parents? As an obstacle to be removed on the 
              path of self-realisation? The haunting memory of our shameful past, 
              to be forgotten as soon as possible? 'My dear son, why don't you 
              smoke anymore? Why don't you watch television, have girlfriends, 
              drink alcohol and be normal?', a mother lamented pitifully while 
              her son pursued the career of a bold celibate student (<i>brahmacari)</i> 
              preacher. Years later, when he fell in love with a dedicated female 
              from his preaching team and married her, the mother welcomed the 
              news with tears of ecstasy, 'I have been praying so much for it!'  
              Or are they fallen souls heading for hell, only to be saved by our 
              enlightening preaching? Well, they are<i> </i>genuinely interested 
              in Krsna consciousness. In this, they differ from all the people 
              in the street, who are too busy to look at the book, who sweep a 
              preacher aside with an impatient, 'No time'. Even if they don't 
              manifest it, our parents do care. At least most of them. They want 
              to know 'What is this thing all about?' But in our attempts to preach 
              to them, we face one disillusionment after another. They are not 
              humble. Instead of inquiring submissively, they scrutinise our motives. 
              Trying to learn something about our process, they will listen to 
              anybody but us: to the neighbours, priests, newspapers. And if they 
              do listen to us, they stubbornly refuse to take our words at face 
              value. They find everything in them but Krsna consciousness. 'Aha, 
              so you want to be a social parasite, without education, without 
              a job? How will you get money? What if you get sick? How will you 
              maintain your future family?' Introducing the idea of Krsna's mercy 
              to them seems virtually impossible.</p>
            <p> Parents are conditioned living beings (<i>jivas</i>), deeply illusioned 
              by the conception of being our proprietors and protectors. We could 
              quote Lord Krsna, 'One who identifies his self as the inert body 
              composed of mucus, bile and air, who assumes his wife and family 
              are permanently his own ...  &#8213; such a person is no better 
              than a cow or an ass,' (SB 10.84.13)   Nevertheless, let us not 
              be too quick to condemn our parents' concern for us as illusion 
              (<i>maya</i>). Srila Prabhupada said that of all the kinds of material 
              attachment, love of the mother for her child is purest. It most 
              closely resembles spiritual love, because it is the most selfless.</p>
            <p> Unfortunately, in our degraded age such wonderful, tender motherly 
              love is becoming rarer. Pathologies spread, families break or live 
              without harmony and understanding. Still, we should not condemn 
              our parents' concern for us. It may become an asset in their spiritual 
              life. Lord Kapila says, 'Every learned man knows very well that 
              attachment for the material is the greatest entanglement of the 
              spirit soul. But that same attachment, when applied to the self-realised 
              devotees, opens the door of liberation.'  (SB 3.25.20)</p>
            <p> Even though not yet self-realised, we can help our parents. Preaching 
              to parents is a challenge, because we preach by what we are, rather 
              than by what we say. I used to write to parents who complained about 
              their children's bad behaviour, which they linked with Krsna consciousness, 
              'Devotees of Krsna are trained to become perfect gentlemen. If your 
              child takes Krsna consciousness seriously, you will see how he is 
              gradually changing for the better. If he doesn't, you should understand 
              that he is not serious about Krsna consciousness.'</p>
            <p> A devotee must know how to relate to his parents on the spiritual 
              platform, but without violating the rules and traditions based on 
              their bodily relationship. We cannot use our relationships to help 
              our parents if we are simultaneously acting to destroy them. As 
              the parent-child relationship is one of the closest, our communication 
              with them must be extremely personalised. To teach those who consider 
              themselves his teachers and superiors, a devotee must be adorned 
              with the symptoms of a saint (<i>sadhu</i>), such as tolerance and 
              genuine compassion which helps him keep self-control in the most 
              trying situations. He must know the scriptures, but he will be unable 
              to present Krsna consciousness convincingly unless his theoretical 
              knowledge has already bore the fruit of spiritual realisation. He 
              must know how to apply the teachings according to time, place and 
              circumstance (<i>desa-kala-patra</i>). All these qualities of a 
              devotee are found on the <i>madhyama-adhikari</i> platform, the 
              middle stage of self-realisation. The <i>kanistha-adhikari</i>, 
              or beginner, on the other hand, is distinguished by his lack of 
              knowledge of how to relate to devotees and others.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Spiritual progress begins with <i>sraddha</i></p>
            <p>There is no benefit gained by associating with holy men (<i>sadhu-sanga)</i> 
              without faith<i> (sraddha</i>). In other words, our parents will 
              not accept our devotional life unless they trust us. If they cannot 
              understand our behaviour, motives, and values, they will not want 
              to accept what they hear from us. The difficulty is that they judge 
              us according to their values, which may be very materialistic, and 
              so they may see us as failures as long as we don't pursue material 
              goals. To evoke <i>sraddha</i> in society, Lord Caitanya had to 
              go so far as to accept the renounced order of life (<i>sannyasa</i>) 
              from an impersonalist (<i>Mayavadi).</i></p>
            <p> It is not advisable that we compromise our basic principles or 
              beliefs, however there are things we can do to help develop our 
              parents' <i>sraddha</i>. Here are a few tips I have collected from 
              various devotees during years of counselling.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Be respectful</p>
            <p>A devotee respects all living entities, understanding that the 
              Supreme Lord resides in their hearts as the Supersoul (<i>paramatma)</i>. 
              Aside from that, we have special reasons to respect our parents: 
              raising a child requires a formidable effort. We have an obligation 
              to them, and before we hurry to quote the famous, '<i>devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam-pitrnam</i>' 
              verse (SB 11.5.41) ('One who has given up all material duties and 
              taken full shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, who gives shelter 
              to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living 
              beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one's forefathers who 
              have passed away.'), we should note that it speaks about pure devotees. 
              Those who are still materialistic, (<i>prakrta-bhaktas)</i>, are 
              never advised to give up carefully discharging their social duties. 
              This is confirmed by Srila Prabhupada in the purport to <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              2.38, just before he quotes the above-mentioned verse,</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness 
                or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he 
                who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of Krsna 
                consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor 
                to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Respecting parents is one of the pillars of the Vedic culture. 
              In 1966, when Brahmananda Dasa's mother came to the temple for his 
              initiation, Srila Prabhupada asked his disciple to offer obeisances 
              to her. He encouraged temple devotees to write letters to parents 
              regularly.</p>
            <p> Our parents are much older than us and they have more experience 
              with life. Even if they are atheists, they may have something interesting 
              to say. If we see them as demons, they may become demons. In psychology, 
              this phenomenon is called 'labelling'.</p>
            <p> Last, but not least, there is the law of <i>karma</i>. The way 
              we treat our parents now, our children will treat us in the future. 
              Children don't do what we say, they do what we do.</p>
            <h2 class="maintextsubhead">Don't take the position of an authority</h2>
            <p>You may be eighteen or older, you may have graduated, you may have 
              a job and even your own family. You will be considered a grown-up, 
              a mature individual, able to 'kill his own snakes', by everyone  
              but your parents. As Shaunaka Rishi Dasa put it, 'Your parents remember 
              you as a helpless baby whose diapers they used to change. This is 
              the vision they worship.' He illustrated this by telling a story 
              of an eighty year-old lady whose sixty year-old son was a Christian 
              monk. Whenever they met, she nagged him, 'Why don't you get married?'</p>
            <p> To evoke <i>sraddha</i> in your parents, you must somehow act 
              consistently with their image of you as their child. Taking a higher 
              position and sermonising is certainly not what they expect of their 
              child. 'If you don't stop eating meat, do you know what you will 
              become in your next life? A pig!', a devotee tried to convince his 
              mother. She retorted promptly, 'Well, I may become a pig, but you 
              are one already!'</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Your parents want  you to be safe</p>
            <p>Don't show extreme callousness toward your material situation. 
              Even if it is a genuine dependence on Krsna on your part ('Are you 
              sure it is not just the carelessness of youth, or a simplified beginner's 
              understanding of advancement?'), they will take it as a symptom 
              of immaturity. Thus they will worry and conclude that they still 
              have to ensure your safety  and so they will try to limit your 
              freedom. Therefore if you are sick, do go to see the doctor. Make 
              sure you eat properly. Dress properly. Sandals in winter are not 
              appreciated! Don't travel without tickets or engage in risky business. 
              Don't drop out of school, especially not from primary or secondary 
              school; education is important for future employment prospects. 
              There are many years ahead of you to realise it.</p>
            <p> You can, however, gently discuss your views to your parents, giving 
              them examples of how illusory material safety is. It's best if these 
              are examples of people they know.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Your parents want you to be happy</p>
            <p>Often one can hear parents saying, 'I dreamed that my son would 
              become ... He didn't. But I can see that he is happy with what he 
              is doing. What more can I desire?'</p>
            <p> You are happy in the temple, with devotees. But do you ever show 
              happiness or an optimistic attitude when you are at home with your 
              family? Do you ever tell them stories of happy or funny events in 
              your devotional life? There are always incidents so simple that 
              even non-devotees can relate to them. Share such stories with your 
              parents. They will hear about devotional service and become acquainted 
              with the topic in an easy, pleasant way. Thus they may lose their 
              fear of the unknown and it will make communication easier for all.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Your parents want you to love them</p>
            <p>Every parent expects their child to show them love and gratitude. 
              Take time to spend with your parents, remember about their birthdays, 
              try to please them in various little ways. If you live away from 
              home, visit them or contact them regularly. If the relationship 
              is tense, calling may be more practical.</p>
            <p> Be firm in the basic principles of your behaviour, but flexible 
              in details. Show understanding for their sentiments. Don't ridicule 
              what they consider their holy tradition. There may be meat and alcohol 
              on the Christmas table, but if you don't agree to sit with them, 
              they will take it as a personal insult. They will be too hurt to 
              be able to look at the situation from your point of view.</p>
            <p> My personal experience was that when I tried to be flexible and 
              tolerant in details, my mother would respond to my sensitivity and 
              she would apologise to me for any inconvenience caused by her habits. 
              Now whenever I visit her, she hides all 'forbidden' substances or 
              removes them from the home. This is her way of showing respect for 
              me and also my attachment to Krsna consciousness, and this is in 
              itself a kind of service.</p>
            <p> Don't avoid bodily contact. Mothers tend to be especially sensitive 
              in this regard. As their little child, you used to show affection 
              in this way and your reserve ('Don't touch me, I'm a monk [or nun]') 
              can deeply hurt them.</p>
            <p> One aspect of your loving response is being open to what they 
              want to tell you. If you visit them only to preach and take some 
              money but never have time to listen, how can you expect them to 
              feel accepted by you? We know that a devotee associates with the 
              materialists in order to give them spiritual knowledge. He should 
              not let himself be dragged down to their mental level. But preaching 
              is an act of communication. And genuine communication must be open 
              and two-way. It must be dialogue. How would you feel if your spiritual 
              master limited himself to instructing you, without ever reading 
              your letters or hearing about your life? Maintaining mutual relationships 
              with people around us, including our parents, is not a waste of 
              time.</p>
            <p> If your parents are favourable to it, you may even try to ask 
              their advice ('I feel that I offended someone in the temple, how 
              can I clear up the situation?'). They will feel you take them seriously 
              and they may surprise you with the depth of their understanding. 
            </p>
            <p> Although your parents may be materialistic, by the arrangment 
              of destiny they are your parents and thus, unless they engage in 
              violent or aggressively offensive behaviour or they desire it otherwise, 
              we are bound to a special relationship with them during this lifetime.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Your parents want to be proud of you</p>
            <p>Perhaps your parents dreamed about another career for you. Still, 
              you may try to identify the values which they wanted you to imbibe, 
              and which are compatible with Krsna consciousness (cleanliness, 
              Regulation, perseverance, honesty). Prove to them that you still 
              accept these values, and that they are accepted by ISKCON in general.</p>
            <p> My mother always wanted me to be a good student, to have higher 
              education, and she especially hoped that I would learn to speak 
              English well. Therefore when I joined, I used to tell her stories 
              of how useful my knowledge is in my work, of other devotees studying 
              at my university, or how I was asked to interpret for an important 
              guest in the temple etc. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>Further guidelines to consider</b><i></i></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Don't dump the responsibility for your 
              family conflicts on ISKCON</p>
            <p>It is a misunderstanding to think that being an ISKCON member gives 
              one the right to treat one's family unfairly. If your involvement 
              with ISKCON conflicts with your involvement in the family, this 
              is your personal problem. Solve it as best you can and take responsibility 
              before your family members for the solution you have chosen. Never 
              dump the responsibility on ISKCON. No ISKCON authority is in the 
              right to instruct you to break off from your family.</p>
            <p> Sometimes young devotees feel that running away from home and 
              staying in the temple will improve their Krsna consciousness and 
              service. But such childish, irresponsible actions bring unnecessary 
              trouble not only to the parents and to the devotee in case, but 
              to the whole temple or even region (<i>yatra</i>), which will by 
              far overweigh the value of all contributions made.</p>
            <p> 'The reason my parents give me trouble is that I have joined ISKCON. 
              Shouldn't ISKCON give me shelter?' In most cases, family conflicts 
              have much deeper roots. Maybe you are searching for your place in 
              life. Your parents feel they are losing you, and because they are 
              unable to accept the fact that you are not their little child anymore, 
              they conveniently blame ISKCON. It is so easy to find the enemy 
              outside. The scenario may be more dramatic: there may have been 
              psychological problems in your family for many years. None of its 
              members, including you, are ready to bring them to the surface and 
              work for a solution. Being a part of the problem, you may not even 
              be able to realise your own deeper motives in treating your family 
              the way you do  no matter how many verses you quote to authorise 
              your actions. Such cases require professional counselling. But in 
              any case, the responsibility is on you  not on the temple president, 
              nor on your guru, nor on Krsna.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Take personal responsibility for your choices 
              and actions</p>
            <p>This advice, closely related to the preceding point, puts to the 
              test our personal maturity and integrity. It is especially important 
              to those whose parents are afraid that ISKCON is a sect and will 
              do their children harm.</p>
            <p> Amongst devotees, we often account for our actions by referring 
              to an authority. 'My department head told me to do it. My Guru Maharaja 
              wants his disciples to distribute books. I cannot drink alcohol, 
              this is forbidden. I cannot watch TV, devotees don't do it.'.  We 
              understand that the basis for our following spiritual or institutional 
              authority was free choice, and that we wholeheartedly agree with 
              the instructions we follow. But our parents may not be so sure of 
              that. If we refer to the authority too often, they may get the impression 
              that we are enslaved, brainwashed, forced to undergo austerities 
              against our will. Therefore, when you explain your motives, point 
              to logic and to your free choice, not to the Vedic or ISKCON authority. 
              'I chant because I like it. Sixteen rounds a day is standard and 
              I want to keep it.' 'I have chosen to refrain from meat eating because 
              I have become convinced it is better for my body and mind.' (Give 
              book titles, including non-ISKCON publications). 'I have to go now 
              because I have promised to my friend that we will distribute books 
              together today.' (Not 'I have to go, this is my service.') 'Excuse 
              me, I won't watch this film. There is so much violence in such films.' 
              (Not 'The <i>Gita</i> says it is <i>maya</i>'). 'I will not eat 
              meat anymore. I cannot stand the thought of slaughter.' (Not 'Only 
              non-humans eat meat.').</p>
            <p> Another thing you can do to prevent notions of brainwashing is 
              to prove that you haven't lost the ability to accept criticism. 
              If your parents criticise ISKCON and are right, admit it. If they 
              witnessed an incident when the devotees treated you (or someone 
              else) improperly, don't try to deny it. Especially if your parents 
              themselves were the victims. Maintaining respect and humility, express 
              your negative judgement of the particular action and inform your 
              parents what you are going to do about it. Unfortunately, ISKCON 
              is not a society of pure, advanced saints (<i>paramahamsas</i>). 
              Don't find faults, but don't try to create an idealised picture 
              of our movement. Sooner or later they will realise its falsity and 
              lose all faith. Moreover, the same may happen to you, because cheaters 
              ultimately cheat themselves.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Give your parents the freedom to be what 
              they want to be</p>
            <p>What if your parents don't respond to your attempts to help them 
              in their spiritual lives? You should remain respectful. Lord Krsna 
              Himself respects the independence of all living beings.</p>
            <p> Even if our parents do not join ISKCON, by good example they may 
              become less sinful, more religious. Maybe they will become better 
              Christians. There was a case in Perm, in Russia, when a girl joined 
              Krsna consciousness and her parents were so inspired by her choice 
              that the father decided to become a priest and the mother joined 
              a monastery. If we have a sectarian vision ('either they join us 
              or go to hell'), our parents will sense it and resist any any of 
              our attempts to help them. And they will be right, because such 
              an attitude proves we do not know our own philosophy. Don't cross 
              them out ('they will go to hell anyway'), but wholeheartedly give 
              them freedom of choice. This is not a psycho-technique. You have 
              to work it out in your own conscience with the help of your spiritual 
              realisation.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Be patient</p>
            <p>'My parents are hopeless! They will never change. What is the use 
              of associating with them?' Try to remember your own first steps 
              in Krsna consciousness. Did you accept everything at once? You were 
              young, curious and wanted to join the movement. Your parents are 
              older, more mature, more fixed in their ways, and above all, they 
              didn't make a decision to join. It takes much longer for them to 
              accept new ideas and make changes. But if you simply keep contact 
              with them and show them a good example, after some years wonderful 
              things may happen. Here is a story told by Kirtiraja Dasa which 
              illustrates this point.</p>
            <p> Kirtiraja lived in Sweden for many years. He kept regular phone 
              contact with his mother, although she never seemed favourable to 
              his way of life. But he would still call and inform her where he 
              was and what he was doing. At one point he was asked to go to Russia 
              to help the devotees there. This was long before the present changes 
              so his mission was not at all safe. Before leaving, he called his 
              mother. 'I am going to Russia,' he said, anticipating her nervous 
              reaction. 'The devotees there need help.' 'Oh yes, you have to go 
              there, carry out this mission,' she answered. He was so surprised 
              that he exclaimed, 'Aren't you afraid something may happen to me!?' 
              'Lord Krsna will protect you,' came the answer.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Introspect and examine your motives</p>
            <p>Most of us are not completely pure. It is difficult to see one's 
              own <i>anarthas</i> (internal faults). But judging from the absence 
              of ecstatic symptoms, we must still have impure motives. It is good 
              to sometimes reflect, 'Why do I want to be in ISKCON? Is it because 
              I only want a spiritual life? Or maybe I want to get away from my 
              family, school and other responsibilities. Maybe I am just attracted 
              by the exotic lifestyle. Or maybe the philosophy gives me a pretext 
              to break my personal relationships, because somehow I cannot make 
              them successful? Maybe I want to be a great devotee, a powerful 
              renunciant worshipped by the general populace? Do I preach to my 
              parents because I want to help them, or because I want to hurt them 
              in revenge for all the bad things they are doing to me?' Such introspection 
              may make you more humble and sensitive to the needs of others. It 
              is a condition of your self-improvement.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Seek qualified help</p>
            <p>There may be problems in your family which are impossible to solve 
              by the usual methods. Your parents may be alcoholics, criminals 
              or have a mental disease. In such cases, seek professional help, 
              perhaps from a devotee who has some experience and education in 
              this field. Seeking the advice of an authority is very important. 
              Also keep your temple authorities informed about the situation.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>Home is the place from where we start our journey in life. Krsna 
              consciousness is our most important journey. Therefore let us be 
              careful about how we make the first steps. Sooner or later, we will 
              leave our parents behind. But whether we will leave them satisfied 
              and eager to give us blessings, or in a state of suffering, being 
              angry, fearful or frustrated  may depend on us and may have a great 
              impact on our journey.</p>
