  <p><i>The question of  
    sampradaya, or the disciplic lineage of spiritual teachers, is the basis of 
    authority for all religious and philosophical teachers and movements arising 
    from the Vedantic traditions. There is no conception of religious organisation 
    among these traditions which does not include reference to sampradaya. Therefore, 
    questions of succession and how the links are made to traditional successions 
    is the most essential ingredient in understanding authenticity and integrity 
    in precept and practice among most of the Indian sub-continent's spiritual 
    movements. Thus, this interview between Steven Rosen and William Deadwyler 
    is a very important contribution to our understanding of the Hare Krishna 
    movement and its roots. The research and information shared in this interview 
    also presents one of the most comprehensive accounts of the Brahma-Madhava-Gaudiya 
    sampradaya available to us today.</i></p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Most people who study East Indian philosophy don't know about the <i>parampara</i> 
    system. They've heard about <i>guru </i>/ disciple relationships, of course, 
    but they generally don't know about the authentic preceptorial lineages &#8213; 
    the various Vaisnava <i>sampradayas</i> &#8213; and the importance of being 
    initiated into one of those traditions. So I thought that we could perhaps 
    begin by explaining, philosophically and scripturally, the importance of the 
    Vaisnava <i>sampradaya</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    The notion of <i>sampradaya</i> &#8213; also called <i>parampara,</i> which 
    means, literally, 'one after another' &#8213; is found in the fourth chapter 
    of <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i> There Krsna says that he originally taught the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
    to the Sun god Vivasvan, who taught it in turn to Manu. Then Krsna says, <i>evam 
    parampara praptam imam rajarsayo viduh:</i> this secret teaching was passed 
    down in this way, one after another, in <i>parampara,</i> and the saintly 
    kings all understood it in that manner. Here we find the notion that sure 
    and certain knowledge is revealed. It is transmitted through spiritual sound 
    &#8213; <i>sabda</i> &#8213; which is only truly given by Krsna or his representatives 
    in disciplic succession.</p>
  <p> A tradition, 
    or <i>parampara,</i> is meant to preserve spiritual knowledge, or truth, through 
    successive links in a chain that carries on over the years, one generation 
    after another. Krsna implies in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> &#8213; in the same 
    verse from the fourth chapter &#8213; that if and when the disciplic succession 
    is broken, and the knowledge is consequently lost, he himself descends to 
    re-establish it.</p>
  <p> Philosophically 
    you can call this 'a descending process' (<i>avaroha pantha</i>)<i> </i>&#8213; 
    the knowledge comes down from Krsna, who is God and therefore perfect. The 
    purpose of a tradition, or a genuine <i>guru</i>, is to preserve the original 
    and perfect revelation intact and complete. You can't improve on it. You can't 
    add to it, but rather you preserve it and teach it.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Now, there are a lot of <i>gurus</i> in India, and perhaps elsewhere in the 
    world as well. But which <i>gurus </i>represent the genuine <i>parampara</i> 
    system? Or, more important than that &#8213; which lineages are authentic 
    from the Vaisnava point of view? I mean, if one were looking for a <i>guru</i>, 
    which lines of disciplic descent should one be aware of?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    You're asking about the recognised <i>sampradayas.</i> Well, the word <i>sampradaya</i> 
    literally means 'a community'. A text from the <i>Padma Purana</i> quoted 
    widely in Vaisnava writings speaks directly about these authorised communities. 
    It says that 'Those <i>mantras </i>which are not received within a <i>sampradaya</i> 
    are fruitless; they have no potency'. The text then specifically names the 
    <i>sampradayas</i>. 'In the Kali-yuga, there will be four <i>sampradayas.</i>' 
    &#8213; we are talking about Vaisnava <i>sampradayas</i>­ &#8213; 'They are 
    the Brahma Sampradaya, originating with Brahma; Sri Sampradaya, starting with 
    Laksmi; Rudra Sampradaya, starting with Siva; there's another one starting 
    from Sanaka and the others, the Kumaras'. Those are the four recognised Vaisnava 
    <i>sampradayas</i>.</p>
  <p> Each one 
    has their main <i>acarya</i>, or definitive teacher who enunciated the doctrine 
    for that <i>sampradaya</i>. For the Sri Sampradaya, there is Ramanuja. For 
    the Brahma Sampradaya, there is Madhvacarya. The Rudra Sampradaya has Visnusvami. 
    And the <i>sampradaya</i> of the Kumaras has Nimbarka.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    In regard to the Visnusvami Sampradaya, I've heard something to the effect 
    that Vallabha and Visnusvami were the same person. True or not?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    No, Visnusvami was much earlier than Vallabha, and I believe that none of 
    his works have survived. Now, Vallabha, who was a contemporary of Caitanya 
    Mahaprabhu, said that he was associated with the <i>sampradaya</i> of Visnusvami. 
    But they are not the same person. In fact, Vallabha wrote his own commentary 
    on <i>Brahma-Sutra</i> (the <i>Anu-bhasya</i>) and on <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> 
    (the <i>Subodhini</i>) and founded his own group called the Pusti-marga, although 
    he is closely linked with the Rudra Sampradaya. However, he doesn't seem to 
    have received much specific traditional teaching from the Rudra Sampradaya. 
    So Visnusvami is the one that we often hear of as being the principle <i>acarya</i> 
    of the Rudra line, and he's from way back when. No one knows his dates. But 
    Vallabha was a contemporary of Sri Caitanya. The Vallabha line really has 
    their own <i>sampradaya</i>; otherwise the Rudra line is not active, as far 
    as anyone can see.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    So could you say Pusti-marga <i>is </i>the Rudra Sampradaya?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    In a sense, yes, although most people just call it the Vallabha Sampradaya. 
    I've never heard anyone refer to it as relating to the prior <i>sampradaya</i> 
    or going back beyond Vallabhacarya. But formally they claim to be in the Rudra 
    Sampradaya of Visnusvami.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Have you heard that this verse from the <i>Padma Purana </i> the one you 
    quoted  has been brought into question by Stuart Elkman and even by O. B. 
    L. Kapoor? They say that they can't  actually find it.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Yes, present-day scholars have claimed that current editions of the <i>Padma 
    Purana</i> don't include that verse. That may be so. But it's quoted by Madhvacarya 
    and other early writers.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Kavi Karnapura quotes it.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Right. So it may not be in modern editions, but it was found there somewhere 
    along the way. That's the simplest explanation. Others will decide that the 
    verse was fabricated or something of that sort ... this is the virtue of accepting 
    knowledge in disciplic succession. Believers will accept the verdict of their 
    teachers, as it comes down through the tradition, the <i>parampara</i> system. 
    Others will be confused about this.</p>
  <p> Unfortunately, 
    there are different versions or manuscript traditions of various <i>puranas</i> 
    &#8213; it's very difficult. There are many editions from various times and 
    places. The <i>Padma Purana</i> is huge, too. I don't know how many scholars 
    have personally gone through it verse by verse. And the verse we're talking 
    about may be tucked away in some edition somewhere for all I know  for all 
    anyone knows.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Well, whatever the case may be, we do indeed find to this day that those four 
    <i>sampradayas</i> are in fact the major traditional lineages of Vaisnavism 
    in India. So let's move on from the four authorised chains of knowledge to 
    how the Gaudiya Sampradaya is aligned with them. It is said that the Gaudiya 
    school is connected to the Brahma-Madhva Sampradaya.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Yes. The claim for that is found in a number of places. The main reference 
    is a list of the <i>guru parampara</i> found in Baladeva Vidyabhusana's <i>Govinda-bhasya</i> 
    and <i>Prameya-ratnavali</i>. And also in Kavi Karnapura's <i>Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika,</i> 
    the earliest statement. It's also in another one, a younger contemporary of 
    Caitanya  Gopala-guru. His work doesn't survive, but it's quoted somewhere 
    else.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    B. B. Majumdar mentions eight.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's right. There are eight places in addition to Baladeva and Kavi Karnapura 
    where the affiliation is brought out. But the really significant ones are 
    those that I've mentioned. Gopala-guru was a disciple of Vakresvara Pandita.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    I think his work is called <i>Padya</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's it. And it's also mentioned in the <i>Bhakti-ratnakara</i> of Narahari 
    Cakravarti.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Well, the other important place is Visvanatha Cakravarti's <i>Gauranga-svarupa-tattva-candrika.</i> 
    That's a bit later, but it's an important reference because he was such a 
    prominent <i>acarya.</i></p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Now he was an associate of Baladeva Vidyabhusana. Visvanatha Cakravarti was 
    the very one who sent Baladeva to debate the authenticity of the Gaudiya Sampradaya. 
    We can conclude that there was some agreement at that time that this list, 
    with its Madhva connection, was indeed the correct <i>parampara.</i> At least 
    these two important <i>acaryas  </i>Baladeva and Visvanatha  agreed. So, 
    yes, Visvanatha Cakravarti also accepted it.</p>
  <p> This comes 
    from the Vrindavana side  they all accepted the Gaudiya affiliation. So there 
    was some consensus of opinion. But the earliest writer to attest to the affiliation 
    was Kavi Karnapura. In other words, the idea was there in Orissa as well. 
    Of course, Baladeva was originally form Orissa himself. There's a work by 
    a Mukherjee called <i>The History of the Caitanya Faith in Orissa.</i></p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Oh, Prabhat Mukherjee. He's a very important and well-known historian of Oriyan 
    Vaisnavism.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Prabhat Mukherjee finds a number of Oriyan Vaisnavas who affiliate themselves 
    with Caitanya and give a <i>guru parampara</i> that includes Madhva. So it 
    seems to have been accepted in Orissa at a time soon after Caitanya's disappearance. 
    Thus, there was a firm, early tradition that Caitanya's disciplic succession 
    descended from Madhvacarya. And so it's called the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya.</p>
  <p> Some scholars, 
    however, have held that the affiliation was an invention of Baladeva Vidyabhusana, 
    who was originally a Tattvavadi, a Madhvite. Then, through his spiritual master, 
    Radha-Damodara, he became a Gaudiya Vaisnava. So some people think he had 
    ideological motives for 'affiliating' the Caitanya movement with Madhva. S. 
    K. De, one of the big doubters of the authenticity of the list, even hints 
    that Baladeva himself may have written the <i>Gaura-ganoddesa-dipika</i> and 
    attributed it to Kavi Karnapura, in order to back-date the affiliation.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    What is his evidence?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    There is no evidence whatsoever. S K. De's 'seminal' book,<i> Early History 
    of the Vaishnava Faith and Movement in Bengal</i>, which is probably the most 
    comprehensive early history of Gaudiya Vaisnavism in Bengal, at least in the 
    English language, is full of forced conclusions. Yet it remains the standard 
    work on the subject, at least for scholars. De seems to bend over backwards 
    to ape the manners of Western critical scholarship, and he tries to doubt 
    everything conceivably doubtable. There's almost a presumption of falsification 
    in the documents  guilty until proven innocent. He questions the historicity 
    of <i>everything</i>.</p>
  <p> So he cast 
    doubt on this <i>guru-parampara </i> the linking of the Gaudiya school with 
    the Brahma-Madhva Sampradaya. Now he's not alone in this, nor did the idea 
    originate with him. He was following some earlier Bengali writers from the 
    twenties and thirties. But you will find the first and one of the more prominent 
    places where the affiliation is rejected is Surendranatha Dasgupta &#8213; 
    <i>History of Indian Philosophy</i>. In the fourth volume of that work, in 
    the section on Madhva, Dasgupta lists the succession of Madhva gurus, stating 
    that this is largely at variance with the list given in the introduction of 
    the commentary on the <i>Brahma-Sutra</i> by Baladeva Vidyabhusana.</p>
  <p> After quoting 
    Baladeva's list, Dasgupta tells us (on Page 56 of Volume 4): 'We see that 
    the list given by Baladeva is in total discrepancy with the two lists given 
    from the Madhva <i>mathas </i>in Belgaum and Poona'.  So Dasgupta rejects 
    it.</p>
  <p> But B. N. 
    K. Sharma, in his <i>History of the Advaita School of Vedanta and Its Literature</i>, 
    brings to light the miscalculation made by Dasgupta. You see, there are a 
    number of Madhva <i>mathas</i>. The one that Dasgupta quotes is the disciplic 
    succession of the Uttaradi Matha. That Uttaradi Matha twice divided and so 
    you end up with three <i>mathas</i> &#8213; the Uttaradi Matha and two others. 
    But Dasgupta was ignorant of these two splits.</p>
  <p> However, 
    one of these offshoot <i>mathas</i>, called the Vyasa-raja Matha, records 
    a line of disciplic succession that appears quite similar to the one Baladeva 
    and Kavi Karnapura give. And <i>this</i> is an official Madhva list. I can 
    go over it with you. Here's what happened. After Madhva, we find listed Padmanabha, 
    Nrhari, Madhava, and Aksobhya.</p>
  <p> Now in the 
    Madhva tradition, these four are frequently regarded as direct disciples of 
    Madhvacarya, although some places say that Nrhari, Madhava and Aksobhya were 
    all initiated by Padmanabha. At any rate, they're pretty much contemporaries. 
    Aksobhya's disciple was Jayatirtha. He was the famous commentator and systematiser 
    of Madhva's teaching. All of these devotees, by the way, were the heads of 
    <i>mathas</i>, <i>mahantas</i> or  'pontiffs' as Sharma calls them. There 
    may have been other advanced <i>acaryas</i> during their time. But the list 
    only contains the leaders of the <i>matha</i>.</p>
  <p> After Jayatirtha, 
    the official Madhva list mentions Vidyadhiraja. The list from Baladeva, however, 
    has Jnanasindhu, Dayanidhi and then Vidyanidhi. The list from Kavi Karnapura 
    has Jnanasindhu and, instead of Dayanidhi, Mahanidhi, and then it also has 
    Vidyanidhi. So if you accept, as Sharma does, that Vidyanidhi and Vidyadhiraja 
    are the same person &#8213; just a variation of the same name &#8213; then 
    what you have in Baladeva's and Kavi Karnapura's list are two names, Jnanasindhu 
    and Dayanidhi or Mahanidhi, that are introduced between Jayatirtha and Vidyanidhi.</p>
  <p> After Vidyadhiraja 
    or Vidyanidhi, assuming that it's the same person, the branching off from 
    the <i>matha</i> takes place, and you get the distinctive Vyasa-raja Matha, 
    named after Vyasatirtha, who was a later head of that <i>matha</i> and became 
    very famous. Next in succession is Rajendra, who is in Baladeva's list; then 
    the Madhva list has Jayadhvaja whereas the Gaudiya lists give a variation 
    on that name &#8213; Jayadharma. And then it's the same: Purusottama, Brahmanyatirtha, 
    Vyasatirtha. So up to that point, everything's fairly consistent.</p>
  <p> There's really 
    not too much to fuss about &#8213; you've got two extra names and a few variations 
    on names, which is common enough. Now, after Vyasatirtha, Baladeva lists Laksmipati 
    Tirtha, Madhavendra Puri and Isvara Puri, who was Caitanya's <i>guru</i>. 
    And those first three names do not appear on any Madhva list. So this is the 
    problem ...</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Right. This is where the real controversy begins.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Exactly. Well, first of all, there's the controversy that concerns Surendranatha 
    Dasgupta, which we've looked at &#8213; he didn't even recognise this list. 
    But as we've shown, following B. N. K. Sharma up until Laksmipati Tirtha, 
    there's not a whole lot of difference in the two lists.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    And minor differences shouldn't be all that shocking, because, for example, 
    if two disciples of different <i>gurus</i> are writing books, let's say, five 
    hundred years from now, and they make a list of teachers, each list would 
    be different, leading up to their particular <i>guru.</i> That's natural. 
    It's like a tree with many branches.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's right. But at this point we should deal with the second problem, the 
    one that arises after Vyasatirtha.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    You mean the one involving Laksmipati Tirtha?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Right. Although Laksmipati Tirtha is indeed absent from the Madhva list, there 
    is a simple solution: this Laksmipati Tirtha wasn't a <i>mahanta</i>. He was 
    an initiated disciple of Vyasatirtha, but he was not at any time the head 
    of a Madhva <i>matha</i>. I think that's a very simple and likely explanation.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    You're saying that his name isn't on the list because he was not a leader.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Because the Madhva lists don't contain every disciple. They list only devotees 
    who served for some time as the heads of <i>mathas.</i></p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    I'm interested in something related to this: how would you explain that Laksmipati 
    appears to be the last of the people with the 'Tirtha' titles? After him you 
    have Madhavendra <i>Puri.</i></p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's the more interesting puzzle. All of those <i>acaryas</i> up to that 
    point have a 'Tirtha' in their names. Even Madhva's name was Ananda-tirtha. 
    The 'Tirtha' title originally came from a Sankarite order, because Madhva 
    was initially initiated in the Sankarite order, and it is characteristic of 
    Madhva <i>sannyasis</i>. So then you have Madhavendra Puri, Isvara Puri &#8213; 
    you get a 'Puri' title, which belongs to another Sankarite order. Now how 
    does that happen?</p>
  <p> There are 
    some plausible explanations for it. One of them is that Madhavendra Puri, 
    in fact, took <i>sannyasa</i> initiation in an Advaita <i>sampradaya</i> &#8213; 
    just as Caitanya Mahaprabhu and, as a matter of fact, Madhva did. And sometimes 
    when people took <i>sannyasa</i>, especially in those days, it didn't seem 
    to matter so much. They took from whomever was handy. That seems to be a reasonable 
    explanation. The change in title doesn't seem a sufficient reason to reject 
    the lineage. The testimony that there was a Madhva connection is much older 
    than Baladeva. And at least if you accept Kavi Karnapura and the similar traditions 
    from Orissa, you can't say they had some 'ideological motive'.</p>
  <p> Another plausible 
    scenario is that Madhavendra Puri could have already been a Mayavadi <i>sannyasi</i> 
    and then met Laksmipati Tirtha. Vyasatirtha is said to have died in 1539, 
    so he was also a contemporary of Caitanya. Caitanya's lifetime was fairly 
    short, but he was born before Vyasatirtha's demise. Still it was possible 
    for Vyasatirtha to have initiated Laksmipati, and that succession could have 
    gone on during his lifetime.</p>
  <p> According 
    to the <i>Bhakti-ratnakara</i> of Narahari Cakravarti, Nityananda was actually 
    initiated directly by Laksmipati. Baladeva, on the other hand, lists him along 
    with Isvara Puri and Advaita Acarya as disciples of Madhavendra Puri. This 
    can be reconciled with Narahari's account, however, as Narahari says that 
    although Nityananda was Madhavendra Puri's godbrother, Nityananda always regarded 
    him as his <i>guru</i>.</p>
  <p> Incidentally, 
    Kavi Karnapura states that one of Jayadharma's (or Jayadhvaja's) disciples 
    was the famous Visnu Puri, author of <i>Bhakti-ratnavali</i>. In that case, 
    we have the Puri title appearing earlier in the list, as belonging to an <i>acarya</i> 
    who was not a <i>mahanta</i>. B. N. K. Sharma speculates that this Visnu Puri 
    may have been the actual teacher of Laksmipati, and so on, and thus the real 
    link between Madhva and Caitanya. In this way Sharma and others, like Stuart 
    Elkman, accept an historical Madhva connection, while having doubts about 
    the exact list of Baladeva or Kavi Karnapura.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    There is another problem that needs to be addressed: if there is a connection 
    between the Gaudiya Sampradaya and the Brahma-Madhva Sampradaya, why is there 
    such a difference in the theology? O. B. L. Kapoor really brings out some 
    divergent views. How would you explain that?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Yes, this has been another reason for doubting the connection, and modern 
    scholars have sometimes made much of it. But the differences are of emphasis, 
    really. The essential teachings are in agreement. Madhavendra Puri, it's true, 
    is credited by the followers of Caitanya with introducing something new. Let 
    me read you something from the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. This is <i>Adi-lila</i> 
    9.10: 'All glories to Sri Madhavendra Puri, the storehouse of all devotional 
    service unto Krsna. He is a desire tree of devotional service and it is in 
    him that the seed of devotional service first fructified.' It says that he 
    is the 'storehouse of Krsna <i>prema</i>'<i>.</i> In his commentary, Bhaktivedanta 
    Swami Prabhupada writes, 'Sri Madhavendra Puri, also known as Sri Madhava 
    Puri, belonged to a disciplic succession from Madhvacarya, and he was a greatly 
    celebrated <i>sannyasi.</i>' And then there's this critique: 'The process 
    of worship in the disciplic succession from Madhvacarya was full of ritualistic 
    ceremonies, with hardly a sign of love of Godhead; Sri Madhavendra Puri was 
    the first person in that disciplic succession to exhibit the symptom of love 
    of Godhead ... '</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Right. I have a few quotes about Madhavendra Puri here: Vrndavana dasa Thakura, 
    in the <i>Caitanya-bhagavata</i>, refers to him as 'the prime architect of 
    the devotionalism in Bengal'. Krsnadasa Kaviraja calls him 'the first sprout 
    of the wishing tree of devotion'. So it seems that Madhavendra Puri moved 
    the Brahma-Madhva conception from awe and reverence, or worship of Narayana 
    (which was more common in the Madhva Sampradaya), to worship in <i>madhurya</i>, 
    or the sweet loving aspect that's found in Radha-Krsna. Apparently, there's 
    some element here of moving from <i>vaidhi-bhakti</i> to <i>raganuga-bhakti</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Precisely. That's what the commentary is talking about here. Madhavendra Puri, 
    the commentator notes, was 'the first to write a poem beginning with the words, 
    <i>ayi dina-dayardra natha he</i>'. This verse is recorded in <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, 
    <i>Antya-lila,</i> chapter eight, verse thirty-four. I'll return to the poem 
    later. 'In that poetry,' the commentary continues, 'is the seed of Caitanya 
    Mahaprabhu's cultivation of love of Godhead.'  So that seed is contained in 
    Madhavendra Puri's verse, and that verse expresses Radharani's anguished feelings 
    of separation from Krsna.</p>
  <p> The <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> 
    says that Madhavendra Puri was reciting this very verse while passing away 
    from the material world. I'll give you the translation: 'O Lord, O most merciful 
    Master, O Master of Mathura! When shall I see You again? Because of my not 
    seeing You, my agitated heart has become unsteady. O most beloved one, what 
    shall I do now?' This is Radharani speaking, expressing her most intense love 
    in feelings of separation. The <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> (Antya-lila 8.35-6) 
    says, 'In this verse Madhavendra Puri instructs how to achieve ecstatic love 
    for Krsna (<i>krsna-prema</i>)<i>.</i> By feeling separation from Krsna, one 
    becomes spiritually situated. Madhavendra Puri sowed the seed of ecstatic 
    love (<i>prema</i>) for Krsna within this material world, and then departed. 
    That seed later became a great tree in the form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    But doesn't it go further?  I remember ...</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Yes! I'm getting to that. You're right, there's another discussion of this 
    verse in <i>Madhya-lila,</i> Chapter Four, in which Caitanya explained the 
    story of Madhavendra Puri and Nathaji, or Sri Gopala. Here is <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, 
    beginning with Verse 192: 'After saying this, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu read 
    the famous verse of Madhavendra Puri. That verse is just like a full moon. 
    It has spread the illumination all over the world.'</p>
  <p> 'By continuous 
    rubbing,' the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> goes on, 'the aroma of Malaya sandalwood 
    increases. Similarly, by considering this verse, its importance increases.'</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    This is a glorification of the verse spoken by Radharani, the verse that reflects 
    her mood.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Yes. <i>Ayi dina-dayardra natha he</i>. The <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> continues: 
    'As the <i>kaustubha-mani</i> is considered the most precious of valuable 
    stones, this verse is similarly considered the best of mellow poems. (<i>rasa-kavya</i>, 
    poetry about <i>rasa</i>). Actually this verse was spoken by Srimati Radharani 
    Herself, and by Her mercy only was it manifest in the words of Madhavendra 
    Puri.</p>
  <p> So what is 
    this saying? It's saying that Radharani revealed this verse directly to Madhavendra 
    Puri, or that by Her mercy it was manifest in the words that emanated form 
    Madhavendra Puri's mouth. And then Krsnadasa Kaviraja says, 'Only Caitanya 
    Mahaprabhu has tasted the potency of this verse. No fourth person is capable 
    of understanding it.' That is, only Srimati Radharani, Madhavendra Puri and 
    Caitanya Mahaprabhu understood this verse. Then it says, 'Madhavendra Puri 
    recited this verse again and again at the end of his material existence. Thus 
    uttering this verse, he attained the ultimate goal of his life.' And then 
    the verse is quoted in Text 197. </p>
  <p> Now I want 
    to look at some of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's commentary on this text 
    here. Prabhupada writes, 'Out of the four <i>sampradayas</i>, the Sri Madhvacarya 
    Sampradaya was accepted by Madhavendra Puri. Thus he took <i>sannyasa</i> 
    according to <i>parampara,</i> the disciplic succession.'</p>
  <p> Here, we 
    see Prabhupada's statement that it was a sannyasa initiation. If this is so, 
    the 'Puri' title must have been used in the Madhva order, at least outside 
    of the formal <i>matha</i> structure. Kavi Karnapura's mention of Visnu Puri 
    as a disciple of Jayadharma (Jayadhvaja), gives some support for this idea.</p>
  <p> Anyway, the 
    commentary goes on: 'Beginning from Madhvacarya down to the spiritual master 
    of Madhavendra Puri, Laksmipati Tirtha, there was no realisation of devotional 
    service in conjugal love.' Then he says, 'Sri Madhavendra Puri introduced 
    the conception of conjugal love for the first time in the Madhvacarya Sampradaya.' 
    So here on the Gaudiya Vaisnava side is a frank recognition that there was 
    something new with Madhavendra Puri in this <i>sampradaya.</i></p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    So is that to say that devotees before the time of Madhavendra Puri could 
    not attain Goloka Vrndavana? They only went to Vaikuntha?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Well, does it say that?</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    That does seem to be the implication ...</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    In the Madhva Sampradaya, the Deity that they were worshipping was Narayana.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    So they go to Vaikuntha.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's where they'll go; they'll go to Vaikuntha. And if in the Sri Sampradaya 
    they were worshipping Sita-Rama, for example, then that's what they'll attain 
    &#8213; Ayodhya &#8213;  which is also Vaikuntha.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    Well, was anyone worshipping Krsna prior to that time?</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Of course. But even so, the worship was largely on the platform of <i>vaidhi-bhakti</i>, 
    that is, formal regulative service. Krsna worshippers on that platform could 
    attain the majestic feature of Krsna in Dvaraka or Mathura, but not Goloka 
    Vrndavana. That is obtainable only by devotion on the spontaneous platform, 
    <i>raganuga-bhakti</i>.</p>
  <p> But let me 
    finish reading this commentary on Madhavendra Puri's verse: 'Sri Madhavendra 
    Puri introduced the conception of conjugal love for the first time in the 
    Madhva Sampradaya.' Now, the next comment is interesting: 'This conclusion 
    of the Madhvacarya Sampradaya was revealed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu when 
    he toured Southern India and met Tattvavadis, who supposedly belonged to the 
    Madhva Sampradaya.'</p>
  <p> So the idea 
    here, at least from the Madhva-Gaudiya point of view, is that there were potentialities, 
    spiritual realisations, latent within Madhvacarya, and these were fully brought 
    out later by Caitanya Mahaprabhu and, before him, in a less manifest form, 
    by Madhavendra Puri. The implication here is that, for reasons of time and 
    place, Madhvacarya may not have spoken these things aloud, or not have made 
    certain things explicit, although they might have been recognised by followers 
    with realisation.</p>
  <p> What the 
    Gaudiya Vaisnavas generally say is that Caitanya's philosophy of <i>acintya- 
    bhedabheda-tattva</i>, and also his teaching on the <i>madhurya rasa</i>, 
    are a kind of synthesis and capstone of the philosophies of the four <i>sampradayas</i>. 
    Yet it's significant that Caitanya himself took initiation in the Madhva Sampradaya. 
    He singled it out, so to speak, because of his appreciation for its strong 
    polemic against the Mayavadis. More than anyone else, Madhva and Jayatirtha 
    really were ferocious in their opposition to the Mayavadis.</p>
  <p> Now you can 
    list a number of differences between what's commonly accepted as the philosophy 
    of Madhvacarya and that of the Six Gosvamis. But you can make another list 
    of similarities. If you ask me, the similarities are greater. So it's really 
    a question of what you consider important, and what you consider secondary.</p>
  <p> With a teacher 
    as rich and profound as Madhvacarya, it's a question of what in his writings 
    becomes emphasised, what becomes expounded upon by his followers, what becomes 
    the prevalent mode of teaching. And there will be other things latent in those 
    teachings which will not receive much emphasis, and yet may seem to be of 
    greater importance at a later time. So it's a question of how you look at 
    it. There are differences. And finally, that's why Baladeva Vidyabhusana, 
    who's one of the big proponents of the Madhva affiliation, also had to write 
    a separate commentary on <i>Vedanta-sutra</i> specifically for the Gaudiya 
    Sampradaya. Because there are certain things in Madhva's works &#8213;  relating 
    to  Gaudiya practices &#8213; that you won't find, such as the worship of 
    Radha-Krsna together. This won't be found in Madhva's works. The Madhvites 
    worship Narayana, and they generally don't worship Laksmi-Narayana as well 
    &#8213; just Narayana alone. The fact that there are differences between the 
    philosophy of the Madhvites and the Gaudiyas is not argument against historical 
    affiliation.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    You know, in some ways, it always seemed to me that the Sri Vaisnavas &#8213; 
    the Ramanujites &#8213; were very close to the Gaudiya idea. At least as much 
    as the Madhva teaching. You know, when Mahaprabhu met with Vyenkata Bhatta 
    , they seemed to really get on pretty well. And the <i>sakti</i> thing is 
    there &#8213; Laksmi-Narayana.  So there is a closeness.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    Right. Well, it depends on what Madhvite you talk to, you know. I've spoken 
    to some who strongly remind me of a kind of Christian, actually, in their 
    'this is the only way' mode of relating. Their emphasis on duality, a dualism 
    that they have emphasised, also sometimes seems  quite extreme &#8213; 'there's 
    no oneness between God and the living being, no similarity whatsoever.' Well, 
    I don't know if I can accept that.</p>
  <p> On the other 
    hand, a scholar like B. N. K. Sharma, who's a Madhvite scholar, will say that 
    Caitanya's <i>acintya-bhedabheda-tattva</i> is really just a variation of 
    Madhva's category of <i>visesa</i>. And he sees a clear development out of 
    Madhva's teaching. Whereas some other scholar will say, 'You know, they're 
    two completely different things', and so on.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    I once read in an early <i>Harmonist</i> that the reason Mahaprabhu chose 
    the Madhva Sampradaya with which to align himself, as opposed to the other 
    <i>sampradayas</i>, was because Madhvites emphasised duality &#8213; they 
    taught that the living being is different to God. And when there's a difference, 
    there's more of an aptitude for service.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    That's right.</p>
  <p><b>Steven Rosen:</b> 
    I thought that this was very nicely put.</p>
  <p><b>Dr. Deadwyler:</b> 
    This reminds me of something I wanted to speak about. What gives some scholars 
    problems &#8213; on the doctrinal level &#8213; with this Madhva affiliation 
    is the high respect Caitanya Mahaprabhu gives Sridhara Svami's <i>Bhagavata</i> 
    commentary. Most scholars regard Sridhara Svami as an Advaitin, and he was 
    regarded in this way by Sankarites, too; they accepted him as one of them, 
    although he did get into trouble with that community. His commentary on the 
    <i>Bhagavata</i> was controversial, and it did seem as though it might not 
    have actually been accepted because Sridhara Svami did recognise a quantitative 
    difference between the soul and the Supreme Lord. And, of course, there is 
    a Madhva idea here, as you mentioned.</p>
  <p> So the Gaudiya 
    Vaisnavas do not accept him as a real Advaitin. Even though he was apparently 
    recognised by the Sankara Sampradaya as one of them, they thought he was trying 
    to stay too close to Vaisnava ideas. As far as the Vaisnava <i>sampradayas</i> 
    are concerned, we have to recognise a great deal of overlapping. The four 
    orthodox <i>sampradayas</i> teach basically the same thing, which is that 
    is one is an eternal servant of Visnu or Krsna, or one of his many incarnations. 
    The emphasis and the details may differ, but the truth is ultimately one.
