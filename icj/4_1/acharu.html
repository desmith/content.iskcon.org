            <p class="maintextsubhead"><a href="contributors.html#da">Daniel Acharuparambil, OCD</a> </p>
            <p>In this article, Prof. Acharuparambil outlines a Christian's 
    view of Hinduism and interreligious dialogue.  It is valuable not only for 
    its view of how the Catholic Church is dealing with the discussions on mission 
    and dialogue, but also for its analysis of Hinduism.  Considering his conclusions, 
    it could be said that devotees of Krsna have much the same problems with 'proselytism' 
    in the West as Christians might do in India. On reading the quotes from typical 
    'Hindu' sources such as Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Tagore and Gandhi, one may 
    also question whether they still adequately represent the opinions of Hindus 
    involved in dialogue today or whether contemporary Hinduism needs to be reassessed.</p>
  <p>It is well-known 
    that many religions, including Hinduism, look mistrustingly at Christian attempts 
    at interreligious dialogue &#8213; considering them to be merely the old 'proselytism' 
    with a new face. In this presentation I will attempt to uncover, after first 
    briefly examining the concept of interreligous dialogue in relation to the 
    Church's official point of view, some of the rather difficult problems that 
    a Christian encounters in his effort to undertake serious dialogue with a 
    Hindu.</p>
  <p> First of all, interreligious 
    dialogue is a method of communication among followers of different religions.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1] </a> It means not only discussion, 
    but also includes all positive and constructive interreligious relations with 
    individuals and communities of other faiths which are directed at mutual understanding 
    and enrichment.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> 
   [2] </a> It is a meeting among people 
    religiously strong in their own tradition, all trying to witness what is specific 
    and personal in their religious convictions and experiences regarding man 
    and his destiny, his place in the universe, his dependence on the Supreme 
    Being and other questions of common interest, while at the same time welcoming 
    other testimonies with respect and sympathy.</p>
  <p> Religious systems do not meet, 
    but religious people, deeply-rooted in their own heritage, do; and what brings 
    them together is love, contributing as well to a reciprocal enrichment in 
    their faith. In fact, to find ourselves faced with the real testimony of a 
    different faith, always entails an invitation; a positive challenge to return 
    to our own faith in a deeper, more conscious and personalised way. Dialogue 
    therefore means a witness given and received for mutual advancement on the 
    road religious enquiry and experience, and at the same time, for the elimination 
    of prejudice, intolerance and misunderstandings.<a href="#_edn3"
name="_ednref3" title="">[3] </a> It allows one to discover and  
    respect the prodigiousness and variety of God's work in human history.</p>
  <p> In this respect, the Second 
    Vatican Council signals the beginning of a new age in the Church's official 
    view of other religions. This is characterised by the dialogue, as envisaged 
    by Nostrae Aetate, the declaration on the Church's relationships with non-Christian 
    religions. The Post-councillor Magister has been deeply committed to developing 
    and further deepening the doctrine and discipline of dialogue at every level. 
    Pope John Paul II has stated, 'Dialogue does not originate from tactical concerns 
    or self interest, but is an activity with its own guiding principles, requirements 
    and dignity. It is demanded by deep respect for everything that has been brougth 
    about in human beings by the Spirit who blows wherever he wills. Through dialogue 
    the Church seeks to discover the seed of the Word, a ray of the Truth which 
    enlightens all men.'<a
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4] </a></p>
  <p> But the recognition of the positive 
    values of other religions and the encouragement to sincere dialogue with them, 
    far from being an obstacle to proclaim Christ, must be an incentive to do 
    so. The Pope teaches vigorously: those who are incorporated in the Catholic 
    Church ought to sense their privilege and for that very reason their greater 
    obligation of bearing witness to the faith and to the Christian life as a 
    service to their brothers and sisters and as fitting response to God.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5] </a> </p>
  <p> According to the Church, missionary 
    activities are an intrinsic need of the Christian faith. Fidelity to Her Divine 
    Founder's mandate requires that the Church should never tire of her commitment 
    to bring everyone the Good News of Christ. Therefore, all her activities and 
    enterprise have always had, more or less evidently, a missionary feel. Interreligious 
    dialogue cannot be an exception to this; on the contrary, it is an important 
    added dimension of  it.</p>
  <p> The problem is that it is exactly 
    these implications in the Christian's approach to dialogue which create suspicion 
    on the part of the Hindu. Hindus dislike external interference in their own 
    tradition, desiring a peaceful cohabitation with other religions. Their principle 
    is 'live and let live'. According to Hinduism, it is necessary that all interreligious 
    dialogue respects that principle, without excluding the reciprocal enrichment 
    which can be had from an 'unselfish' dialogue. From that point of view, it 
    can be said that Hinduism is particularly open to interreligious dialogue, 
    and for the same reason, it is very resistant to a Christianisation of that 
    dialogue.</p>
  <p> It is sufficient to identify 
    some fundamental Hindu doctrines on the attitudes that emerge therefrom to 
    discover the reasons of that affirmation.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">Hinduism and religious pluralism</p>
  <p>For Christianity, 
    which believes in the uniqueness of God's revelation in Christ and the universality 
    of His message, other religions are an inevitable target of its missionary 
    engagement. The Hindu vision is completely different. It doesn't want to grant 
    to any religion, including itself, the attributes of uniqueness and universality. 
    Its approach can be qualified as religious relativism, recognising the intrinsic 
    value of individual religions and the consequent spirit of religious tolerance, 
    accompanied by an intolerant attitude for any external interference in its 
    own religion. This is not a vision of religious indifference, but rather a 
    deep esteem for its own tradition and the engagement to live up to its ideals, 
    while at the same time there is a sincere respect for other traditions and 
    what they represent.</p>
  <p> We can affirm that this position 
    is as old as Hinduism itself, but in modern times, Hindu leaders have seriously 
    deepened it. They have articulated it strongly, publicising it widely. They 
    propose a religious philosophy which justifies such an approach. The starting 
    point is this main principle: Religion, in an absolute sense, is only one 
    and consists of the personal realisation of the Supreme Being. From this point 
    of view, the profession of a doctrinal body and the observance of a ritual 
    system are of secondary importance. 'Religion,' remarks Dr. Radhakrishnan, 
    'is not a creed or codex, but the intuition of reality, the direct experience 
    of Supreme, the achievement of the state of Illumination.'<a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6] </a></p>
  <p> The phenomenon of religious 
    pluralism is explained by the fact that people define the Supreme Being according 
    to their social and cultural genius and their own moral and spiritual evolution. 
    Individual religions are historically formulations of a single religion that 
    transcends all forms. Thus, every religion is deeply sacred for its respective 
    followers because it is closely bound to their history and is an integral 
    part of the interior soul; it characterises the identity of that people and 
    determines the nature of their spiritual quest.</p>
  <p> The following observation of 
    Radhakrishnan is significant: if a Hindu chants the Vedas on the banks of 
    the Ganges, if the Chinese meditates upon Analects, if the Japanese worship 
    the image of Buddha, if the European is convinced of Christ's mediatorship, 
    if the Arab reads the Koran in the mosque and if the African bows down to 
    a fetish, each one of them has exactly the same reason for his particular 
    conficence. Each form of faith appeals in precisely the same way to the inner 
    certitude and the devotion of its followers. It is their deepest apprehension 
    of God and God's fullest revelation to them.<a href="#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title="">[7] </a></p>
  <p> Religion isn't an external imposition, 
    but an internal heritage, often simply because one is born at a certain place 
    and time. 'We can not condemn someone for not having chosen his parents,' 
    says Radhakrishnan, 'so we cannot convict him for not having chosen his religion.' 
    Every religious tradition is worthwhile and precious, provided that it is 
    able to enlighten the human soul.</p>
  <p> Swami Vivekananda, following 
    the teaching of his venerable master, Sri Ramakrishna, insists that we must 
    respectfully accept every religion, and be ready to join every religious tradition 
    to worship God, who is only one, whatever His name. In that spirit, he expressed 
    the following prayer, at the conclusion of his talk at the World's Parliament 
    of Religions in Chicago (1893): 'May He who is the Brahman of the Hindus, 
    the Ahura Mazda of Zoroastrians, the Buddha of Buddhists, the Jehovah of the 
    Jews, the Father in Heavens of Christians, give strength to you to carry out 
    your noble ideas!'<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title="">[8] </a></p>
  <p> Defending religious pluralism, 
    Tagore added another intuition. God has manifested himself in this world through 
    the immense variety of his Creation; he never wanted the world to be characterised 
    by monotony and uniformity. Similarly, in the expression of our return to 
    our Creator, a constant variety of individuality is required. The world would 
    be extremely poor if one religion assimilates all the others into it. If such 
    a flood occurs, affirms Tagore, God will provide another ark to save his creatures 
    from the catastrophe of spiritual desolation.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> 
   [9] </a></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">No religion is<span class="maintextsubhead"> </span>definitive</p>
  <p>After justifying 
    that religious pluralism is necessary for humanity and wanted by the Creator 
    Himself, Hindu thinkers insist that no religion can properly boast to be final 
    and absolute, because everyone is defective and imperfect. This is inevitable 
    because religion is formulated and interpreted by men, who are limited and 
    fallible. Every religion is subject to evolution and re-interpretation; the 
    progress towards truth will be possible only through that evolution. Therefore 
    Gandhi confesses: 'It was impossible for me to consider Christianity as the 
    perfect religion, or as the greatest of all religions (...), neither was I 
    convinced of Hinduism being such.'<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> [10] </a> The reasoning that he uses to confirm his position 
    is this: the pious lives of Christians didn't give me anything that the lives 
    of men of other faiths had failed to give. From the point of view of sacrifice, 
    it seemed to me that the Hindu greatly surpassed the Christians.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">Every religion is worthwhile</p>
  <p>Even if no religion 
    can claim to be absolute and decisive, every religion, according to Hindu 
    tradition, is worthwhile and efficacious. Sri Ramakrishna tirelessly teaches 
    that all religions are safe paths which lead men to the unique source of eternal 
    happiness, the Divine, and so everyone must faithfully follow his way and 
    respect the same freedom of the others.</p>
  <p> Gandhi was particularly eloquent 
    when defending the variety of religions. He writes: 'After long study and 
    experience, I have come to the conclusion  that 1) All religions are true; 
    2) All religions have some errors in them; 3) All religions are almost as 
    dear to me as my own Hinduism.'<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11] </a> 'All religions are true,' explains 
    Gandhi, 'because they contribute efficaciously to the spiritual progress of 
    humanity.' But since men, their heirs and interpreters are imperfect, they 
    are stained by some imperfections. If we are open and welcoming enough, we 
    will be able to purify them of these faults. So Gandhi's advice is that we 
    must not only appreciate, but also integrate into our own faith, the best 
    elements of other religions.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">Religious tolerance</p>
  <p>The logical conclusion 
    of the principle of unity in diversity of religions, and the consequent insistence 
    on the essential validity of all religions, is precisely the need for religious 
    tolerance. Practically all great Hindu figures are given to that ideal. Religious 
    tolerance is the necessary condition for peace among men. The affirmation 
    by an individual religion that it has the light and that others are groping 
    in darkness, is actually a challenge to other religions, a provocation to 
    fight. Never forget: the recognition in other religions of the presence of 
    the seed of the Word and of the ray of truth which enlightens all men, though 
    generous and  positive on the part of Christianity, is far from satisfying 
    for the followers of those religions.</p>
  <p> Dr. Radhakrishnan points out 
    that the spirit of tolerance, (dialogue is its current development), must 
    not spring from a vague feeling of sympathy or compassion for the faults of 
    others, but from the belief that Truth always transcends human understanding; 
    that God contains in Himself more then man knows. For that reason he affirms: 
    'Toleration is the homage which the finite mind pays to the inexhaustibility 
    of the Infinite.'<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"
title=""> [12] 
    </a></p>
  <p> Gandhi was, if we can say such, 
    the incarnation of religious tolerance. Perhaps no-one else in human history 
    has engaged himself with so much dedication to remove fanaticism and to spread 
    religious tolerance. In fact that kind of effort cost him his life!</p>
  <p> Hindu tolerance is not at all 
    a passive attitude; but rather it is strongly active and intolerant towards 
    every expression of intolerance and interference with other religions. Hindus 
    react in an aggressive way against so-called 'proselytism', which is seen 
    as the most odious manifestation of religious intolerance. That kind of reaction 
    is part of a self-defence mechanism which came to be consolidated among the 
    Hindus in the light of long years of sad experiences from Islam and Christianity. 
    From the time the Portuguese landed on Indian soil (1498) until the independence 
    of India from British Rule (1947), Christianity and missionary activity were 
    seen as deeply bound to Western Imperialism and to oppressive Colonialism. 
    In addition, the missionaries not only converted many Hindus to Christianity, 
    but also expressed severe criticism of the errors, real or supposed, of Hinduism. 
    All this contributed to create the impression that Christianity and missionary 
    activity were against Indian interest, creating many militant Hindu movements.</p>
  <p> Thus, in 1875, Swami Dayananda 
    Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj association with the aim of both reviving 
    in the Hindu society a deep pride of her millenary religion and culture and 
    purging it of every extraneous 'contamination', particularly from Christianity 
    and the West. Inspired and incited by those ideals, there are some political 
    parties working in India today (Hindu Maha Sabha, Rama Rajya, Rashtriya Seva 
    Samgha, Jana Samgha and Bharatya Janata Party) with the declared purpose of 
    transforming the country into a Hindu theocracy and assimilating the minority 
    religions as much as possible. All these movements are resolutely hostile 
    to missionary activity and to conversion. In fact they have introduced a 'purification' 
    ritual to resume in Hindu society, those who have been converted to Islam 
    or Christianity.</p>
  <p> There are still other cultural 
    and religious elements in Hindu tradition that make the dialogue between Hinduism 
    and Christianity extremely  difficult.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">The refusal of an institutionalised religion</p>
  <p>Although Hindu social 
    life is strictly institutional, religious and spiritual life, especially at 
    its advanced levels, is very liberal and individualistic, and consequently 
    it instinctively refuses a rigorously organised religion. Hindu thinkers believe 
    that when religion is articulated in a dogmatic way, it curtails man's freedom 
    and prevents the spontaneous and efficacious blooming of his spiritual energy. 
    The variety of human character and temperament also needs variety in its quest 
    of the Divine.</p>
  <p> Hinduism traditionally respects 
    the Adhikara-Bheda principle, that is the variety of people's spiritual competence. 
    In fact, the different currents of Yoga,<a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13] </a> that outline as many orientations 
    in spiritual path, are designed to serve people according to their natural 
    tendencies. The institution of guru assures that the candidate has made the 
    most suitable choice.</p>
  <p> Thus, the outward observances 
    of rites, sacraments and of other expressions of a religious cult, even if 
    important and compulsory for popular religions, are ignored in spiritually 
    advanced stages. The only things that matter at that level, they say, is contemplation, 
    accompanied by asceticism and detachment, to be crowned by the Divine experience.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">Divine revelation is not definite</p>
  <p>According to Hinduism, 
    the affirmation that revelation, both in the form of sacred books and of Divine 
    Incarnation is definite, is unacceptable. It asserts, contrarily, that God's 
    revelation is a continuous and unceasing process. As for the scriptures, Swami 
    Vivekananda states: 'The Bible, The Vedas, The Koran and all the other sacred 
    books are but so many pages of revelation and an infinite number of pages 
    remain yet to be unfolded.'<a
href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> [14] </a> His advice, therefore, is that we must be open 
    to welcome divine light that comes from all sources at all times.</p>
  <p> As for Divine Incarnation, specifically 
    in Jesus, many Hindus accept willingly that he is an incarnation of God. But 
    in general they respect him as a great master (guru) and a thaumaturge like 
    a famous ancient yogi. Testimonies abound which show how deep is the fascination 
    that Jesus Christ exerts on the Hindu heart  especially for his extraordinary 
    dignity, his moral integrity, his courage, his patience, his unselfish love, 
    the beauty and the depth of his teachings. But if we affirm that Jesus Christ 
    is the unique and definite incarnation of God, then Hindu refusal will be 
    unequivocal.</p>
  <p> The reason for this refusal 
    must be found in the Hindu tradition itself which, many centuries before the 
    Christian age, believed in a similar well-rooted doctrine that talked about 
    different incarnations of God. The word used is <i>avatara</i>, meaning descent. 
    It is the belief in the repeated descents of God in a visible form with the 
    intent to save people. Whenever humanity finds itself in particular difficulty, 
    God comes visibly to its help. Krsna, the incarnated God, says in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>: 
    'Whenever there is a decline of righteousness, O descendant of Bharata, and 
    a rise of unrighteousness then I descend Myself. In order to deliver the pious 
    and to destroy the miscreants, as well as to reestablish righteousness, I 
    came in to being from age to age.'<a href="#_edn15"
name="_ednref15" title="">[15] </a></p>
  <p> According to that vision, Sri 
    Ramakrishna teaches: 'It is the same universal God that assumes different 
    shapes of incarnation: diving in the ocean of life he manifests himself here 
    as Rama, there as Krsna, somewhere else as Christ!' Similarly, Vivekananda 
    exhorts: 'Let us find God not only in Jesus of Nazareth, but in all the great 
    Ones that proclaimed Him, in all who have came after him and in all who are 
    yet to come.'<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16"
title=""> [16] 
    </a></p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead">Historicity has no special appeal to the 
    Hindu</p>
  <p>The Hindu religion, its beliefs and observances, are not 
    founded on historical events. At a popular level, the Hindus live, one might 
    say, their mythologies; at a higher level, to the contrary, they devote themselves 
    to seek the Divine that transcends every configuration of time and space. 
    In this way, contrary to the Jewish and Christian approach, Hindus are not 
    inclined to ascribe any importance to a sacred history. A religion, deeply 
    bound to the historical events of a people, may be pertinent only for those 
    that can share them; whereas a universal religion must be founded on truths 
    and principles that transcend history. This explains why many of the events 
    and characters of the Hindu tradition are lost in the jungle of legends and 
    mythologies!</p>
  <p> The non-historical Hindu mentality 
    is rooted in its cyclic vision of time, world and human life. While for the 
    Jewish and Christian traditions time is linear, entailing a certain beginning 
    and a decisive ending, for Hindus it is circular, nearly eternal. The belief 
    of the soul's reincarnation is closely bound to this cyclic conception: man 
    is subject to the cycle of birth and rebirth, determined by the relentless 
    law of retribution (<i>karma-samsara</i>).<a
href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17] </a>  Man's final destiny is not 
    decided with just one life; he can hope in many attempts to finally and certainly 
    reach the Summus Bonum of life.</p>
  <p> For Hindus, history therefore 
    is less significant; what matters instead in the religious field, is the authenticity 
    of truth and the integrity of the message. To transmit this doctrine, Hinduism 
    uses different methods, such as mythological tales, parables, dialogues and 
    doctrinal discussions. In fact, the mythological tales have always been used 
    as a very effective vehicle to communicate sublime religious and spiritual 
    ideals to the people. Critics can continue to discuss the historicity of the 
    great figures like Rama and Krsna, but the fact remains that they continue 
    to inspire and strengthen the religious devotion and mystic dedication of 
    many people. This is the justification for the Hindu non-historical approach!</p>
  <p> The following quote from Gandhi 
    shows with extreme clarity the typical Hindu mentality: 'I must say that I 
    was never interested in an historical Jesus. I should not care if it was proved 
    by someone that the man called Jesus never lived, and that what was narrated 
    in the Gospel was a figment of the writer's imagination. For the sermon on 
    the Mount would still be true to me.'<a href="#_edn18"

  <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
  <p>I have tried to spell out clearly and objectively some 
    fundamental, doctrinal and practical elements that make dialogue with Hinduism 
     understood in the sense of the official Christian teaching  a quite difficult 
    enterprise. This presentation clearly shows that the fundamentals of Hinduism 
    and the attitudes rooted within it make it, in one sense, particularly open 
    to dialogue, yet in another, more resistant to it when it bears the stamp 
    of missionary activity.</p>
  <p> In this, we should remember 
    Sri Ramakrishna's advice: 'As you remain firm in your faith and opinion, so 
    leave the others the same freedom to remain firm in their faith and opinion.'<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19] </a> With this perspective in mind, 
    the fruit of every religious dialogue, according to Gandhi, must be: 'Want 
    the Christians to be good Christians, the Moslems to be good Moslems, the 
    Sikhs to be good Sikhs and the Hindus to be good Hindus under all circumstances. 
    That to me is real conversion.'<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20] </a></p>
  <p> All this does not mean that 
    there is no room for dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity. On the contrary. 
    But we must state it in a way that doesn't provoke the Hindu's immediate refusal. 
    It is sufficient to remember the open orientation offered by the Second Vatican 
    Council that tells us: 'Prudently and lovingly, through dialogue and collaboration 
    with the followers of other religions, and in witness to Christian faith and 
    life, acknowledge, preserve and promote the spiritual and moral goods found 
    among these men, as well as the values in their Society and Culture.'<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"

  <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title=""> [1] </a>Two official Vatican documents expressly treat 
    this theme, obviously from a Christian point of view: a) Pontifical Council 
    for the Interreligious Dialogue, <i>The attitude of the Church towards the 
    Followers of Other Religions: (Reflections and Orientations upon Dialogue 
    and Mission),</i> Vatican City 1984. </p>
  <p>b) This was further 
    completed with the following document, subscribed also by the Congregation
