              Doubt and Certainty in Krishna Consciousness</strong>Original article 
              <br>
              by Suhotra Swami appeared in ICJ Vol. 3, No. 2</b></h1>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Lydia Gazziano </p>
            <p>In the last issue of <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i> an article 
              appeared, written by Suhotra Swami that introduced an old philosophical 
              question  the eternal, universal problem of knowledge, or how to 
              define the value of an affirmation related by someone else. This 
              problem has been discussed with sympathy and ability using a tale 
              written by C. S. Lewis. In this tale there is a clever and diligent 
              little girl that asserts to have visited a strange country called 
              Narnia, passing through a wardrobe; but the real characters are 
              the elder brother and an old eccentric professor. These two characters 
              represent empiricism and rationalism respectively. We could condense 
              and resume the two opinions with two sentences. The first one says, 
              'I can't believe because I didn't perceive what Lucy is saying.' 
              The second one says, 'Nothing could be more probable. I don't guarantee 
              that it's true, but science hypothesises the existence of innumerable 
              possible worlds, so why couldn't Narnia exist?'</p>
            <p> An old method to strengthen our assertions used in medieval scholastic 
              theological tradition was the saying <i>ipse dixit</i>, with which 
              they alluded that what we were saying was true because an authoritative 
              person said it previously. The author of the article who presented 
              this dispute, wants to call our attention to the fact that this 
              kind of three-element dialectic is also present in the philosophical 
              tradition referred to as the Vedas, and that the authoritative method, 
              defined by the word <i>sabda</i>, differs in character and superiority 
              by the previously mentioned Western <i>ipse dixit</i>.</p>
            <p> Although I do not want to disagree with the final thesis which 
              could be true, or at least tenable, I feel the need, for the sake 
              of a productive discussion, to show some perplexities about the 
              course of the argument that led to this thesis. It will be my intention 
              to reconstruct the article bringing to light the strategies used, 
              and then to try to rebuild, using in part Suhotra Swami's material 
              and that taken from my reference stock.</p>
            <p> The central question that remains the guiding thread of the whole 
              discussion is 'How can I be certain that what you are telling me 
              is true?' Suhotra Swami proposes the three solutions of the epistemological 
              Indian tradition. These are <i>pratyaksa</i> (life experience), 
              <i>anumana</i> (deductive method, which is used in this article 
              as a synonym of logic) and <i>sabda</i> (or rather authoritative 
              testimony, where the authority is represented by the <i>guru</i>, 
              the Vedic Scriptures and the other religious practitioners).</p>
            <p> The technique used to affirm <i>sabda</i> is, after the presentation 
              of the three methods, to show that sensorial perception and logic 
              are insufficient tools to acquire cognitive evidence. After dismissing 
              the first two, it remains that only the third possibility can be 
              the right one. This reasoning is not correct, because it is not 
              definite that they are the only three possibilities, nor that, among 
              these, there is an operating method.</p>
            <p> I would like to focus attention on an intrinsic problem of the 
              treatise about which method has the priority. In fact, this sort 
              of discussion is destined to a <i>petitio principii</i> or circular 
              course. This problematic has been discussed countless times and 
              by countless philosophers; I will choose one of the easier and incisive 
              formulations.</p>
            <p> We have at our disposal a finite number of possible criteria of 
              acquisition of certainty; we must establish which is the best, if 
              there is one. However, to establish this, we need a criterion of 
              choice and the one I choose will be arbitrary because I have not 
              yet established the priority. This idea is simplified by the famous 
              sentence of Wittgenstein, 'Every observation is soaked by theory'.'</p>
            <p> Accepting the conclusion of hermeneutics and semiotics over the 
              last decades, it is not possible to observe the world and then to 
              theorise it. The way that I observe the world always implies a theory 
              that selects and classifies in a certain way the countless psycho-sensorial 
              data that strike me.(Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)</p>
            <p> This brief digression on gnosiology helps me to introduce the 
              next point. In Suhotra Swami's article, it is possible to distinguish 
              two different linguistic and argumentative registers which are very 
              distant from each other and, in my opinion, they are not compatible 
              or justified.</p>
            <p> In its <i>pars destruens</i>, the article faces the logic, pointing 
              out its limits. This thesis is led with the support of contemporary 
              logical and philosophical reflection. Within it, there appear some 
              explicit and implicit references to B. Russel, K. Ferguson, J. Willson, 
              A. J. Ayer and K. Popper. In the <i>pars costruens</i> that try 
              to present the priority of <i>sabda</i>, the linguistic register 
              is coloured by the unique style of religious institution; to show 
              that <i>sabda</i> is the best method, the author takes for granted 
              the fact that <i>sabda</i> is an effective method. As is in every 
              good tale, this article also finishes with a happy ending: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>As Srila Prabhupada writes in <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is: </i>Perfect 
                Knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is 
                the path of liberation. Liberation of consciousness from the dictation 
                of the mind and senses, and from ignorance and vice, is self-evident 
                in the devotees who take to the path. And when a devotee comes 
                to the end of this path of hearing the Vedic <i>sabda</i>, Krsna 
                personally reveals Himself as Absolute Knowledge, the Absolute 
                Knower and the Absolute Object of Knowledge. This state of full 
                realisation of the truth is called Krsna Consciousness. (cf. Suhotra 
                Swami, 'Doubt and Certainty in Krishna Consciousness', in <i>ISKCON 
                Communications Journal, </i>Vol. 3, No. 2, p. 31). </p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Simply, the logic is contested by the logic itself and <i>sabda</i> 
              is made valuable both by logic, that has just been refused, and 
              by <i>sabda</i>, that has not yet been proven.</p>
            <p> I should say that we need a little more courage to deal with such 
              an issue; to open ourselves to the dialogue, sharing to the end 
              the rules of the world we are talking to. If this could be the case, 
              the solution of <i>sabda</i> seems to appear less strong because 
              it will be at the same level of the other hypothesis, but at least 
              in this option the topic will be coherent.</p>
            <p> The following development of the analysis can lead us to suppose 
              that <i>sabda</i> is a reliable method, and that in this case it 
              is surely the best one. However, this surmation has no strong foundation 
              because it is founded on a supposition, but I believe this is the 
              price of comparison and of a real sharing process. The other solution, 
              as coherent as the first one, is to offer new rules to conversation 
              where the one who speaks is the tutor, who instructs the learner 
              about an unknown culture without trying to get credit, according 
              to the listener's parameter.</p>
            <p> I am loath to admit that in the author's paper I have noticed 
              a substantial closure to a deeper level of comprehension of the 
              opposite theory; in fact I don't think that the counterpart has 
              been treated with sufficient objectivity. The first sign of this 
              is that the variegated and contradictory panorama of contemporary 
              thought is compressed into the limiting denominations of 'modernists', 
              'modern intellectuals' and 'the philosophers', or rather rationalists 
              on one hand and empiricists on the other.</p>
            <p> The article contests the opinions of stereotype intellectuals 
              rather than those who actually exist. It is true that some distinctions 
              between rationalists and empiricists are still present, but it is 
              very difficult to find someone who professes himself integrally 
              like this, without perplexity, openings and grafts arising from 
              other styles of thought.</p>
            <p> The description of modern intellectuals in this article surely 
              does not have all the philosophical updates as references, but represents 
              only part of the contemporary schools, in particular logical neo-positivism 
              which, even though it may be an important branch of present thought, 
              remains partial and identified. Furthermore it has been surpassed 
              and discussed by its own adepts.</p>
            <p> Another sign of lack of comprehension is demonstrated in the way 
              the author uses Cartesio in the last paragraph. According to him, 
              Cartesio was not able to distinguish the soul from the mind. But 
              in the culture where Cartesio lived there was no such distinction. 
              In the European languages we have words such as 'psyche', 'mind' 
              and 'soul' that in the course of time assumed different meanings; 
              but they nonetheless come from a linguistic tradition where they 
              existed separately and led to an unique meaning that is synonymous 
              of life, with a particular reference to breathing. Therefore Cartesio 
              has not confused the soul with the mind, he has simply used a different 
              classification of reality. At this point, therefore, the only thing 
              we can affirm is that the classification of the Vedic tradition 
              is more detailed and more effective for those who want to adopt 
              a certain way of life.</p>
            <p> To conclude my critique, I want to re-examine the article's conclusion. 
              Suhotra Swami gives three criteria by which we can sift the <i>ipse-dixit</i> 
              and <i>sabda</i>. They are in summary:</p>
            <p>1. know what the statement means</p>
            <p>2. know the right way to verify it</p>
            <p>3. have  good evidence for believing it.</p>
            <p>Suhotra Swami asserts that to understand a word we must follow 
              the discipline to which it belongs. Thus, to understand that '<i>sabda</i> 
              is the sound incarnation of Krsna', we have to accept the system 
              of discipline (<i>parampara</i>) through which <i>sabda</i> is handed 
              down. Then, in order to verify the statement '<i>sabda</i> is the 
              sound incarnation of Krsna', we have to consult <i>guru, sastra</i> 
              and <i>sadhu</i>. Finally, it is possible to believe in the statement 
              if we look at the development of consciousness reached by the listeners 
              of <i>sabda</i>.</p>
            <p> I would like to show the danger of the consequences of these arguments, 
              which could ultimately be detrimental to the integrity of the tradition 
              that we want to defend. In fact, in order to understand the meaning 
              of the sentence in question, we must refer to the discipline from 
              which the sentence comes; in this case it is to make the concept 
              of <i>parampara</i> relative  that the only way to verify the authenticity 
              of <i>sabda</i> is to ask those who assert it. What this means is 
              that we can only understand the sense and superiority of <i>sabda</i> 
              if we accept the paradigm it imposes on us. There is therefore no 
              objective method that establishes its value independently from itself. 
              Furthermore, a discipline is strongly tied to history and contingency; 
              it acquires its terms from the context, it re-processes them for 
              its finality and it transforms and is transformed by the surroundings. 
              This is not necessarily wrong, but I do not believe this is our 
              intention when we talk about <i>parampara</i>.</p>
            <p> Moving on to the second part of my paper, I would like to suggest 
              that we can look at the issue of <i>sabda</i> from another perspective, 
              taking into consideration a suggested definition for it found in 
              the <i>Bhagavata Purana,</i> Third Canto, Chapter 26, Text 33.</p>
            <p> The text defines <i>sabda</i> as, 'what conveys the meaning (<i>artha</i>) 
              of an object and is the <i>laksanam</i> (the clue) of the presence 
              of an orator'. This concept can also refer to a passage in the <i>Vedanta 
              Sutra</i>  (<i>V.S</i>. 4,4,22), where <i>sabda</i> is defined as 
              the origin of matter, the means to possess things and the means 
              of liberation from matter.</p>
            <p> I think that these lines that deal with the idea of 'sound' related 
              to 'meaning' could raise enthusiasm in many of those 'modern intellectuals'. 
              The 'language' used over the last century and in particular, the 
              last few decades, has been protagonist of the philosophy, and many 
              researchers (fsuch as Heidegger, Deridda and Jacobson) have opened 
              themselves up to a broad analysis and global approach to the language, 
              a fact which gives a peculiar value to the sound; it also gives 
              value to the sound as origin of the language and the philosophical 
              source of Being.</p>
            <p> Therefore <i>sabda</i> is a very special concept to be conveyed, 
              because in it there is no longer distance between shape and content, 
              between sound and meaning. <i>Sabda</i>, being the cosmic origin, 
              is a relative or ancestor of the Biblic <i>logos</i>, where the 
              sense of things precedes their presence, where the duty of being 
              is priority to being itself. Fascinating discussions can be developed 
              by reading Ricour, Heidegger and Maritain.</p>
            <p> The definition of <i>sabda</i> as the means to possess things, 
              to use or to make them, indicates that sound is also action, and 
              this image recalls Austin's theory, presented in his famous book, 
              <i>Creating Things With Words</i>. This concept also leads me to 
              think about the semioticians I briefly quoted (Sapir and Whorf), 
              who assert that people speaking in different languages inhabit different 
              worlds. Things and the possibility to own and declare them as private 
              property, have as <i>conditio sine qua non</i> the language or the 
              significant sound.</p>
            <p> In the conception of many Hindu schools of thought, to be in the 
              world of matter means to deal with the divine energy trying to possess 
              it; the primal and elementary way to possess something is to impose 
              a name on it. To define etymologically means to put borders on our 
              declared territory. The name is also what stays at the location 
              of the thing, not the thing itself; it is what separates me from 
              what cannot be named. Thus language, seen as a means to name things 
              and therefore to use them, is also what comes between me and the 
              thing.</p>
            <p> Language, amongst all mystics, is the greatest limit between us 
              and God. God is undefinable, unmentionable, indescribable. But the 
              interesting Vaisnava solution consists of conceiving <i>sabda</i> 
              not only as a means but also as a purpose. The sound becomes simultaneously 
              shape and content, and when the object and its name stop being different 
              things, the mystic revelation comes. God reveals Himself in sound 
              or as Suhotra Swami says, '<i>sabda</i> is the sound incarnation 
              of Krsna'.</p>

              </b><b><i>NRM is a Four-letter Word: The Language of Oppression 
              <br>
              </i></b><b>by Mukunda Goswami, </b><b>Vol. 3, No. 2</b></p>
            <p><strong>Timothy Miller</strong></p>
            <p>I sympathise with Mukunda Goswami's chagrin at having the term 
              'new' applied to ISKCON. Certainly that is an inaccurate characterisation 
              for a religious movement whose clearly discernible roots go back 
              several thousand years.</p>
            <p>Mukunda correctly notes that 'spiritual movement' fits ISKCON more 
              precisely than any phrase containing 'new', but that term does not 
              distinguish between mainstream and non-mainstream movements. Unless 
              a non-pejorative way to make that distinction is employed, the default 
              option for non-mainstream groups will be 'cult', which is what we 
              are all trying to avoid when 'new religious movement' somehow became 
              the generally accepted non-pejorative nomenclature.</p>
            <p>This terminological conundrum has no obvious, ideal solution. My 
              own usage of choice is 'alternative religion', which I think conveys 
              non-mainstream status in a non-pejorative way and avoids the potentially 
              misleading 'new'. But that construction is not widely accepted; 
              somehow 'new religious movement' has become the standard in academic 
              discourse, despite the fact that we all understand that it is not 
              accurately descriptive. I find myself forced to use it more than 
              I would prefer, and in that I share Mukunda's terminological despair.
