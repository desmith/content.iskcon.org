            <p>A chill, damp weekend in Wales: a late nineteenth century coal-owner 
              baronial gothic mansion looming out of the mists: doors opening 
              to belated travellers and then warmth, laughter, a great wood fire 
              in the hall and the unmistakable aromas of India from the kitchen. 
              We had come on a Friday evening as guests of the International Society 
              for Krishna Consciousness for a weekend of intense interfaith dialogue, 
              mingled with prayer and worship, and the indispensable informal 
              conversations outside the formal programme.  </p>
            <p> But who, in this context, is 'we'? 'We' were a group of eleven 
              Christians responding to the invitation of Shaunaka Rishi Dasa, 
              Director of  ISKCON Communications Europe, to join with twelve preachers 
              and teachers from ISKCON. Why had the Christians responded? I believe 
              four reasons predominated. </p>
            <p> First, there was our basic commitment. Each one of us was deeply 
              committed to interfaith activity and would regard any invitation 
              from another faith community as a pressing  priority.   </p>
            <p> Second, some of them had already experienced the value of talking 
              to members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              (or, put more technically, followers of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, as expounded 
              by their great master, Sri  A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada. They 
              revere the teachings of the Bengali sixteenth-century saint Caitanya, 
              and focus their devotion upon Krsna, seeking to enter into a love 
              relationship with him). A Saturday conference at Bhaktivedanta Manor 
              last September had left them wanting an opportunity to follow up 
              contacts made there.</p>
            <p> The third reason is perhaps the most significant. With our accumulated 
              experience (I worked it out to being over two hundred and fifty 
              years' worth between us), we were more than willing to go beyond 
              generalised discourse and vague abstractions, so often characteristic 
              of interfaith dialogue in its earliest stages. The opportunity to 
              focus the conversation  by having just one dialogue partner who  
              represented a very specific form of Hindu belief and devotion was 
              extremely attractive. </p>
            <p> Fourth, it had long ago dawned on all of us that scholars and 
              sages of ISKCON were highly trained and immensely acute exponents 
              of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, so much so that they could represent the 
              highest form of that philosophy extraordinarily well to their  fellow 
              westerners.  We were to have the opportunity to discuss with these 
              men and women ideas and concepts with which we were more or less 
              familiar through our reading and study. We were eager to learn from 
              those who embodied these teachings in their life and practice.</p>
            <p> I cannot, of course, speak for the devotees' reasons for inviting 
              us. I am sure, like all of us, they wanted to speak of their faith 
              and commitment, hopeful for a better understanding of why ISKCON 
              was their chosen path for their walk with God. In this they follow 
              the precept of their spiritual master Srila Prabhupada who wrote:</p>
            & we have to work very hard and with intelligence and sincerity for 
            this movement.  It is a great movement undoubtedly but it takes a 
            little time to convince the higher section of society.  Still, that 
            is one aspect of our business because unless the higher section of 
            society understands this movement, it will make progress slowly. If 
            the higher sections say yes, it is a nice movement it will progress 
            very quickly. (Letter, 21 August 1971) 
            <p></p>
            <p>But increasingly they go further than this because, I surmise, 
              of their new-found sense of vocation to enable westerners to understand 
              Indian philosophy. As they are for the most part westerners themselves,  
              they have a unique  opportunity  in this regard and are very aware 
              of their responsibility to  ensure true understanding of Vaisnavism.  
            </p>
            <p> How did we proceed?  Since the devotees are incredibly early risers 
              (and therefore early retirers) nothing happened on the Friday evening. 
              This was refreshing, and this particular veteran of many  weekend 
              conferences offers it as a model. Because we were all up in good 
              time, and fortified by our vegetarian breakfast, by 9.00 a.m. we 
              were ready to plunge straight into the two formal keynote papers 
              on the 'nature of the self'. </p>
            <p> From the Vaisnava side Ravindra Svarupa Dasa offered a paper setting 
              out the nature of the soul as 'a separated, minute fragment of God, 
              the Supersoul'. Because souls are spiritual they belong in the spiritual 
              kingdom, where almost all souls dwell ('the eternally liberated 
              souls')  A tiny minority of souls ('fallen or conditioned souls') 
              inhabit this material world. If they turn away from God and divine 
              service they fall into the inhospitable realm of external material 
              energy. Consciousness discloses the presence of spirit within the 
              material world. The 'I' of the human person is spirit (<i>aham brahmasmi</i>, 
              I am soul), with the corollary 'I am not matter'. Human beings reach 
              their full potential when they realise I am not my body. The renovation 
              of real life is <i>bhakti-yoga</i>, re-connecting the soul with 
              the Supersoul by devotional service whose keynote is love (<i>prema</i>). 
              Souls in this state are fully joyful. In Ravindra Svarupa's eloquent 
              words:</p>
            They neither hanker nor lament. Their happiness doesn't depend upon 
            the course  of circumstance. They see all living beings as the same. 
            They see the agony and hopelessness of the world is exorcised when 
            the illusion that has rendered us oblivious to our own identity is 
            dispelled, and they engage themselves in the highest welfare work 
            of rousing sleeping souls from their nightmare. For themselves, they 
            take no mind of what becomes of the future of their lives. Because 
            they have no material desires, there is no further birth for them 
            in this world. Instead they attain their original spiritual forms 
            in the kingdom of God, spiritual bodies suitable for pastimes of love 
            with the Lord. 
            <p>So lucid a statement not only offered much for the Christian participants 
              to try to come to grips with, but reflected a single internal coherent 
              position. How different was the task undertaken by Keith Ward. For 
              there is no one single Christian understanding of the soul. In masterful 
              fashion Rev. Prof. Ward located the fullest exposition of the soul 
              / body relationship in Aquinas' adoption of Aristotelian philosophy, 
              and went on to show how the collapse of the synthesis achieved by 
              Aquinas has left Christian theologians in not a little confusion, 
              some indeed doubting the existence of the soul as a separate and 
              distinguishable entity within the human personality.  Prof. Ward 
              showed how some recent Protestant theology had, in fact, given upon 
              the ideas of immortality and the soul, using eternal life as a metaphor 
              for the presence of God in this  present life.</p>
            <p> With these two presentations the stage was set. After a mid-morning 
              break the Conference sat down to plan its strategy for dealing with 
              this massive and complex subject. In the event it was decided that 
              we should work in three groups throughout the remainder of the time, 
              each tackling the same broad topic for one hour, and then coming 
              back to the plenary to report on progress and to  decide what the 
              next issue to be taken up should be.</p>
            <p> Happily there was no pressure to reach agreed conclusions. We 
              decided only that there should be this present record, indicating 
              some of the content which we tackled and, we hope, some of the material 
              which might engage us in our next dialogue.</p>
            <p> But first, here are some of the comments about the process of 
              the dialogue itself, and the worthwhileness of being engaged in 
              it. I record them now to give some sense of the immense amicability 
              and freedom of the conversations that took place.</p>
            <p> Vaisnavas have written to me saying that they were moved by the 
              'openness and  humility of all the members of the Christian churches 
              present' and indeed have expressed amazement at the 'lack of false 
              ego' in these participants.   </p>
            <p> They expressed gratitude for the 'real willingness to understand' 
              the Vaisnava  philosophy. Many say that they discovered a real increase 
              of 'respect, appreciation and esteem' for Christians and Christianity, 
              calling our time together 'essential and extremely productive work'. 
              Interestingly for more than a few, our being together was a moment 
              of encountering  things they thought they had left behind when they 
              came to Krishna consciousness. One correspondent commented on the 
              fact that he had faced, discovered and appreciated the message of 
              Jesus. 'Maybe,' he writes, 'this cannot strike you in the same way 
              as me, but it is actually amazing to realise that after living thirty 
              years in a Christian society, you have to wait to receive a &quot;divine 
              gift&quot; and then get to know the religion of your country in 
              a broad and comprehensive perspective.'   </p>
            <p> Many others have spoken appreciatively of new insights and fresh 
              understanding of elements  within their Catholic or Protestant upbringings 
              that hitherto had been meaningless or even untrue to them. For some, 
              the reality of Christian faith and devotion came alive as they joined 
              with us in the Catholic morning office and a Protestant / ecumenical 
              act of prayer and meditation.  Perhaps it  was this last aspect 
              that led a senior Vaisnava to say that he had left the  weekend 
              with a 'far stronger sense of a shared path of devotion to a personal 
              God of grace uniting both Christian and Vaisnava.  We have an important 
              journey to travel together and we are only at the beginning.' </p>
            <p>For their part the Christian participants found the experience, 
              in the words of one of their number 'intellectually demanding, well-organised, 
              enjoyable and instructive'.  Many commented afterwards on the sense 
              of fun that pervaded the intense seriousness of the discussions, 
              for there were outbreaks of great hilarity, not least when one Vaisnava 
              commented (about reincarnation), 'It does make the Odyssey a lot 
              less problematic'. After a moment of blank incomprehension, the 
              light dawned: our friend had said 'theodicy'. Ah yes, we thought, 
              after the laughter ceased, but was there not sense in which we were 
              taking about 'the odyssey' of the soul throughout our sharing together?    
            </p>
            <p> Christians, too, appreciated the moments when we could share in 
              reflection and prayerfulness with the devotees. We counted it a 
              profound privilege when at the very last moment, and in the closing 
              minutes of the conference, our friends spontaneously decided that 
              they would offer their <i>kirtana</i> to Krsna in our presence. 
              Such loving, joyful worship made one Methodist participant wish 
              that she too should have risen from her seat and joined in the singing 
              and the dancing before the Lord.</p>
            <p> And now back to the content of the discussions. Ravindra Svarupa 
              Dasa and Keith Ward had performed their task magnificently and the 
              room buzzed with  innumerable questions.  Extraordinarily courteous 
              negotiations then took place as to which of these issues were the 
              ones most needing attention: the nature of the soul in relation 
              to modern conceptions of personality, the nature of eternity, the 
              meaning of resurrection, the concept of the Parousia, the doctrine 
              of <i>karma</i>, the Vaisnava understanding of the 'subtle body', 
              the relation of the Vaisnava 'liberated spirits' to the Christian 
              understanding of  purgatory and paradise; the list is almost inexhaustible. 
              In any case, an order of procedure was decided upon and off we went. 
              Reportage fails at this point, for now the basic work was done in 
              our three groups, where it was possible for everyone's questions 
              to be addressed, even if not fully answered.</p>
            <p> Yet some flavour of the discussions can be communicated. First, 
              here is a list of questions remaining in the mind of a devotee, 
              which gives a true sense of the scope of the discussion:</p>
            How central to Vaisnava philosophy is reincarnation?  Can reincarnation 
            never be on the Christian agenda and can Vaisnavas do without it on 
            their agenda?  
            <p></p>
            What do we mean by eternity? Will all souls be liberated, or is it 
            possible that some souls never gain liberation? What happens at the 
            resurrection? What is the relationship between, and nature of, the 
            body, the soul and the subtle body? What is the distinction between 
            the subtle body and the 'I' we identify with?  What is it that remains 
            and experiences things after the liberation? 
            <p></p>
            What is the kingdom of God? Is there an end of time or is time cyclical? 
            Does the 'new heaven / new earth' encompass a corporate liberation 
            or is it purely  individual? 
            <p></p>
            How does the concept of reincarnation and spiritual equality fit in 
            with our  observation of the caste system?  If we consider that the 
            soul is not separate from the body, do we not lose out on a socio-political 
            dimension in our dealings with others?   Does that view not make us 
            anthropocentric? Does it not impact upon ecological implications of 
            stewardship? 
            <p></p>
            How do Vaisnavas speak of death to others? What sort of bedside language 
            would we use in comforting a dying person? What is our pastoral approach 
            to death?  And is that different if we were counselling a child or 
            old person? 
            <p></p>
            <p>Second, some thoughts from a Roman Catholic participant. Commenting 
              that the Hindus knew their Sanskrit texts well and quoted from them 
              freely, he notes that it was a puzzle to them that Christians should 
              depend upon scriptures which were written in different languages, 
              and indeed in different cultural and linguistic genres. It was hard, 
              he thought, for them to understand why Christians should have developed 
              a discourse about the soul which originated in Aristotle and which 
              was developed by St. Thomas Aquinas. He responds to the basic question 
               What is wrong with the Bible?  by reflecting that Christians 
              undertake their theology, not by explicating a text within the framework 
              of a defined cosmology but in terms of a narrative.  His reflection 
              on the dialogue is that like so many interfaith encounters, it is 
              not possible for Christians to match text against text, concept 
              against concept.  </p>
            <p> Using the image of the Odyssey, he suggests that for Hindus the 
              narrative is a journey which leads back eventually to 'the original 
              state of relationship which is constantly called to mind in the 
              bliss of devotion'. Odysseus is therefore one model, for in all 
              his endless journeying he is always on the way home. Abrahamic faith, 
              on the other hand, is on a different journey, always looking for 
              another city. Perhaps, suggests this correspondent, Christianity 
              has ways of combining both Odysseus and  Abraham.</p>
            <p> Another comment in this area came from a Vaisnava, who wrote that 
              he was  impressed by the way in which Christian teaching and practice 
              has emphasised discovering divine purpose in this world, not simply 
              postponing it to the next. Some Vaisnavas, he thought, could 'fail 
              to act purposefully in their lives and their society in the name 
              of detachment from the physical.'</p>
            <p> The same correspondent took up some of the pastoral issues that 
              were raised in the conference. He writes:</p>
            I agree that the philosophy of karma can be applied heartlessly when 
            responding to the suffering of others in this world.  If a child is 
            abused or a people persecuted, it is not enough simply to say that 
            it was their karma. Vaisnavas should respond to others with genuine 
            sympathy and be ready to help them in body and soul. 
            <p></p>
            <p>Last, there were some critical reflections from one of the two 
              Swamis present. He noted on the Christian side a lack of willingness 
              to explore the issues through the realms of reason and logic (is 
              this not how our previous writer's assessment that Christians undertake 
              their theology through narrative, is bound to be perceived?). While 
              noting that reason and logic are not the ultimate parameters, the 
              Swami suggests that they are very useful in understanding things 
              as they are, and highlights what he sees as the insufficiently focused 
              nature of the discussions during the weekend.  'I  would,' he writes, 
              'like to have seen an in-depth study of one point and some resolution 
              of that.' He also comments that certain major points went unchallenged 
              in the discussion. One significant one was Keith Ward's acceptance 
              of Darwinian evolution as being harmonious with his Christian beliefs.  
              In these comments was seen the disparity between Christian faith 
              and Vaisnava philosophy, for here conversation was not just Christians 
              with Vaisnavas but Vaisnavas with evolutionists. Thus he raises 
              one important issue for the Vaisnavas. He comments, 'Part of my 
              thinking process was questioning whether what I was hearing was 
              Christianity ... what Jesus taught and what is written or originally 
              written in the Bible.'</p>
            <p> Those last comments lead to some closing reflections from this 
              rapporteur: </p>
            1.  Throughout all the conversations nothing was more clear than that 
            a major Indian philosophic tradition, complete with its internal logical 
            coherence, was encountering a form of religious faith which has no 
            such basis.  From its beginning, Christian faith has been in search 
            of a philosophical foundation, and over the centuries has tried many, 
            such as Platonism, neo-Platonism, Aristotelianism, Existentialism, 
            Personalism, Idealism and (more recently and very much the case in 
            America) Whiteheadian Process thought. The devotees frequently expressed 
            their puzzlement about this and asked for what is impossible in the 
            nature of the case, a clear exposition of Christianity based either 
            upon Jesus' own teaching or the Bible. Would it be helpful to them 
            if they were to plan future dialogues with this in mind?  It could 
            be very useful to ask for a conversation with Christians belonging 
            to particular philosophical traditions, for example with those in 
            the tradition of Thomas Aquinas or with Process theologians. 
            <p></p>
            2.  Christians have not perhaps recognised yet the deeply conservative 
            nature of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, as an exposition of Vedic tradition. 
            Hence some mutual incomprehension and the surprise expressed in several 
            letters afterwards that some Christians seem so readily and easily 
            to have accepted evolution.  Future dialogues need a certain preparation 
            on the part of Christians if they are to understand this feature of 
            ISKCON (an ISKCON publication: <i>The Hidden History of the Human 
            Race</i>, by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson,  Badger CA: 
            Govardhan Hill, 1994, could be required reading). 
            <p></p>
            3.  As I have noted, sharing in each other's devotional life at times 
            of worship, prayer and meditation, was a vitally important part of 
            this conference, and raised many questions for each participant. Some 
            of these were properly and fruitfully answered in private conversations 
            and in the life of the groups, and many members of the conference 
            have expressed great appreciation for the insights freely imparted 
            by dialogue partners. Future dialogue conferences might profitably 
            focus upon issues of devotional life. But here again it would be profitable 
            to recognise distinctive traditions within Christianity. Participants 
            from the Christian side who belonged to what might be called loosely 
            the Pietist-Methodist-Charismatic tradition resonated with many elements 
            of the <i>bhakti marga</i>, described by Ravindra Svarupa as 'pastimes 
            of love with the Lord'. They appreciated particularly the <i>kirtana</i> 
            as a demonstration of  this. They wished they had been numerous enough 
            in the conference to sing full-throatedly the praises of Jesus in 
            the hymnody of John and Charles Wesley, and perhaps of later revivalist 
            and charismatic songwriters, and dancing before the Lord is not unknown 
            in this tradition. At the same time the 'monastic-contemplative' side 
            of Gaudiya Vaisnavism obviously resonated with the more structured 
            devotional patterns represented by the Divine Office and the ecumenical 
            acts of meditation. So again, I suggest that future conferences should 
            take note of these different possibilities in order that a greater 
            coherence within the discussion might be achieved. 
            <p></p>
            <p>Finally, let me stress once again the importance of this conference. 
              There have been other kinds of gatherings sponsored by ISKCON &#8213; 
              meetings of scholars of religion (see for example a fine volume 
              of essays edited by David G. Bromley and Larry D. Shinn, <i>Krishna 
              Consciousness in the West</i>: Bucknell University Press, 1989), 
              but to my knowledge our coming together in Wales was the first  
              where there was appropriate interfaith dialogue at this theological 
              level, in which leading ISKCON scholars and Christian theologians 
              were engaged in mutual challenge and response.     </p>
            <p> From our side I can only say that many other Christian scholars 
              and thinkers need to experience the enormous benefits such dialogue 
              brings. To them I can only say, 'If you are ever invited by our 
              ISKCON friends, do not hesitate to respond &#8213; previous knowledge 
              of Gaudiya Vaisnavism is not required, only openness and commitment.' 
              To my Krishna Consciousness friends, I say simply, 'Thank you'.

            <p>_______________________________________________</p>
            <p><b><a name="kw"></a>The Nature of the Self: A Christian Understanding</b></p>
            <p>by Keith Ward</p>
            <p><b>The background to Christian thought about the self</b></p>
            <p>Christian thought about the self builds on the foundations laid 
              by Biblical Judaism. Genesis 2,7, part of the second creation account 
              in the Book of Genesis, states that 'the Lord God formed man of 
              dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath 
              of life; and man became a living being.' Humans are formed of dust, 
              of material energy, and they will return to dust. They are given 
              life by the breath of God, which can be given and can be taken away 
              by God. The Hebrew word for breath is 'Neshemah', but in Genesis 
              6,17 the same thought, 'breath of life', is expressed by the word 
              'Ruach', which can be translated as 'air' or 'spirit'. So humans 
              are pieces of matter formed and given life by the spirit of God, 
              or by spirit which emanates from God, as breath emanates from a 
              living being.</p>
            <p> Another important element in the Biblical creation stories is 
              given in the first creation account, which states that 'God said, 
              Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.' (Genesis 1,26) 
              Humans image God, like reflections in a mirror or sparks from a 
              fire. They are given 'dominion' over the natural world. Just as 
              God creates and cares for all creatures, so humans are to share 
              in this Lordship, by caring for the natural world and ordering it 
              to the glory and service of God.</p>
            <p> The Genesis creation stories express their belief that the material 
              universe is created for the sake of the forms of goodness it makes 
              possible. Humans do not exist eternally, but originate as parts 
              of the material universe. They have a special role in the universe, 
              which is to shape it to express the glory of  God. They also share 
              in the Spirit of God, and so are able to relate in friendship and 
              love to God. They can be seen as mediators between the material 
              and spiritual realms, ordering matter to become a manifestation 
              of spirit, and offering the material realm, through their consciousness 
              and actions, as a sacrifice of praise to God.</p>
            <p> Early Hebrew thought does not make a great distinction between 
              humans and other animals. Presumably every living thing, not just 
              humanity, is filled with the 'breath of life'. If humans are uniquely 
              in the image of God, this uniqueness lies in their role as stewards 
              of the created world and as the 'priests of creation', who offer 
              it in worship to the Creator. It does not lie in any ontological 
              uniqueness (in being a soul-substance, for example), except insofar 
              as responsible stewardship and worship of God both require reflective 
              thought and fully intentional action. One might fairly say that, 
              on the Biblical view, humans are complex structures of matter which 
              have become capable of self-consciousness, reflection and purposively 
              self-directed action. They lie at one end, on earth, of a continuum 
              of living things, with a responsibility for the well-being of the 
              material order of which they are part.</p>
            <p> It is not surprising, then, that there is little sign of a belief 
              in the immortality of the soul in the thought of the Hebrew Bible. 
              But there are factors pulling in another direction. The Creator 
              is pure Spirit, with consciousness and will. Thus materialism, the 
              theory that there cannot exist consciousness without a material 
              brain, must be false. According to the prophets, God has a desire 
              for relationship with created personal beings. This cannot be a 
              relationship between material beings, so again the possibility, 
              and indeed the fact, of an immaterial, spiritual, personal relationship, 
              is asserted by the Bible. The Creator is a Lord of justice and of 
              mercy, taking vengeance on evil and bringing good to those who love 
              Him. But it became increasingly obvious that those who love God 
              do not always flourish.</p>
            <p> So the idea developed of a further life in which the personal 
              consciousness that had developed on earth could experience a fullness 
              of personal relationship with God, and in which justice could in 
              some way be done. At first a shadowy afterlife in Sheol, a grey 
              half-life, was postulated. Later, possibly under Zoroastrian influence, 
              the idea of resurrection became widely held. The dead would rise 
              to their bodies to Judgement, and according to the lives they had 
              led, enter into an eternal love of God, or an eternal exclusion 
              from the Divine presence. At the time of Jesus, this belief was 
              widespread, but by no means universal among Jews, and even today 
              belief in a life to come is not binding on Jews. That is the background 
              against which Christian belief developed.</p>
            <p><b>The traditional Christian understanding of the self </b></p>
            <p>Jesus taught the resurrection of the dead, and appeared after his 
              own bodily death to the apostles. So Christians are committed to 
              belief in resurrection. As Christianity moved into the disintegrating 
              Roman Empire, it adopted the philosophy of the Greeks to express 
              religious beliefs. After a thousand years of a rather uneasy alliance 
              with Platonism, it was the philosophy of Aristotle which got taken 
              into Western Christian thought by the thirteenth century theologian 
              Thomas Aquinas. His view of the soul was based on Aristotle's 'De 
              Anima', and has become what may be called the traditional Western 
              Christian view.</p>
            <p> In Aristotle's view, Forms are universals or defining natures 
              which are given actualisation and individuated by matter. The soul 
              is the Form of the body, a particular instantiation of a defining 
              nature. However, Aristotle seems to think of a soul, not merely 
              as an abstract definition, but as an actual power which enables 
              a body to act in a certain way. Nutritive souls cause plants to 
              grow and multiply. Animal souls cause animals to perceive and move. 
              Rational souls cause humans to think and intend. Humans are distinctive 
              in having rational souls, which are those properties of bodies which 
              enable them to think and intend.</p>
            <p> In the case of plants and animals, such souls are material properties, 
              and are not separable from the bodies which manifest their activity. 
              This may be true of humans as well, but Aristotle canvasses the 
              possibility of the organ of thought being immaterial, since understanding 
              is not a material activity, and thus possibly has some sort of existence 
              without the body. Aquinas amplifies this view, and asserts that 
              the rational soul is a spiritual principle of thinking and intending 
              which can exist without a body, but whose proper function is to 
              animate a particular material body, to which it is intrinsically 
              fitted.</p>
            <p> Thinking, after all, is closely dependent on a sense-activity 
              to provide objects of thought. Intending is dependent on a body 
              which can act in the world. So the soul is that which gives a  particular 
              complex material body the capacity for reflection and rational agency. 
              It is the subject of the experiences and actions of a particular 
              body. This view can be developed in two ways. One gives a quasi-materialist 
              interpretation (which was probably Aristotle's own), so that talking 
              about the soul is simply a way of talking about the properties of 
              a material body which enable it to think. To say that humans are 
              rational souls is just to say that they are animals which can think. 
              The thinking cannot exist  without the body, the matter, which makes 
              the activity possible. But one can also give a quasi-dualist interpretation 
              (which was certainly Aquinas'), so that the thinking subject can 
              exist substantially. If it does, however, it exists 'unnaturally' 
              or 'improperly', since each soul or substantial intellective form 
              is meant to be the active principle of a material body, and indeed 
              of a particular material body.</p>
            <p> Aquinas was able to develop a view of the soul, the subject of 
              thinking and willing, as able to exist after death in a disembodied 
              state, by the grace of God. In that state, development or purification 
              of the soul is possible (in Purgatory), preparing it for eventual 
              resurrection. But it will not form a complete person until the resurrection 
              of the body, when it will once again have its proper organ of perception 
              and action in a public, communal world. The resurrection was to 
              be of this earthly physical body, with all its physical attributes, 
              though in a perfected form. At the Last Judgement, when earthly 
              history has come to an end, all souls will receive their own bodies, 
              and will enter into their eternal destiny, for final union with 
              or exclusion from the presence of God.</p>
            <p> Disagreements on this subject between Catholic and some Protestant 
              theologians are fairly minor. They mainly arise from the fact that 
              some Protestants insist that the soul never exists in a disembodied 
              state, and so 'sleeps' between death and the General Resurrection. 
              This makes any thought of development of the person after death, 
              or of possible repentance after earthly death, virtually impossible 
              to conceive. The traditional Catholic view, however, also denies 
              the possibility of repentance after death, and the doctrine of Purgatory, 
              as officially formulated, seem more like a time of punishment than 
              of positive development. So many theologians, probably most, feel 
              that the traditional views need to be restated in some way.</p>
            <p><b>A contemporary interpretation using a more Biblical basis</b></p>
            <p>Strangely, the main New Testament passage dealing with resurrection, 
              1 Corinthians 15, 35&#8211;50, did not play a large part in developing 
              the classical Christian tradition. There, Paul makes it clear that 
              the physical body (<i>soma psychikon</i>; literally, the mind-body) 
              dies, and what is resurrected is a spiritual body (<i>soma pneumatikon</i>), 
              as different from the physical as wheat is from the seed from which 
              it springs. He explains that it is impossible to envisage what this 
              body will be like. But it will be incorruptible and glorious, and 
              thus not subject to the laws of space-time. It will be fully part 
              of the 'body of Christ', and thus be a part of God, wholly devoted 
              to the Divine will and expressive of the Divine action. It will 
              not be in this material realm, but in a 'new creation', which has 
              no need of any sun or light and heat. It will live with other resurrected 
              bodies in a community of creative understanding and love.</p>
            <p> One might think of the 'mind-body' as the body which is immersed 
              in this physical world, its attention focused on physical realities 
              and its actions directed to the mastery of nature and the gratification 
              of feelings. The 'spirit-body' will be a body constituted by its 
              intimate relation with God. Its attention is focused solely on the 
              Supreme Lord and its actions will shape nature to endless forms 
              of beauty and happiness, under the direction of the Supreme Lord. 
              It is useless to ask about its form or shape. Nevertheless, it will 
              be perfectly suited to enable the soul to actualise those sorts 
              of capacity which had a largely frustrated expression in the material 
              world.</p>
            <p> In one passage, Paul  writes that as the physical body decays, 
              the spirit body begins to take shape, even during this mortal life 
              (2 Corinthians 4, 16&#8211;5,5). 'Eternal life', for Christians, 
              is not just something which begins after death. It is the quality 
              of life seen in relation to the eternal God. So the spirit-body 
              exists even during life. Paul typically speaks of humans as made 
              up of body, soul and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5,23). In this context, 
              one can interpret the soul as the mind oriented solely towards the 
              material world (the 'false ego'), and the spirit as the personal 
              subject interpenetrated and empowered by the Spirit of God (the 
              true self). For those who are 'in Christ', the Kingdom in a sense 
              exists on earth. Yet it does not exist fully, since it still confronts 
              and is not free from the evil and conflict which mark all human 
              affairs. As long as freedom, conflict and suffering exist, the Kingdom 
              cannot exist in its fullness. This material world, even if it once 
              could, cannot now fully actualise the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p> On this view, the material world comes to have the function of 
              generating souls, subjects of thinking and willing. In a 'fallen' 
              material realm of conflict and suffering, they have responsibility 
              for fighting evil and striving for justice and the flourishing of 
              the natural order, for the coming of the Kingdom of God. However, 
              the Kingdom can only be fully established in the spiritual realm, 
              in which evil is eradicated and all created life shares in the Divine 
              life. In that Kingdom, the Bible supposes, the natural order will 
              be beautiful and pleasing, animals will take their proper place 
              in the community of sentient beings without conflict, persons will 
              live in creative communion, and God will be present in and through 
              all things.</p>
            <p> After death, there may be various sorts of 'embodiment' for the 
              soul, various modes of interaction with an environment in which 
              development in understanding can take place, or in which, perhaps, 
              evil souls can repent and turn back to God (Cf. I Hebrew 3, 18&#8211;20). 
              This would correspond with the 'Sheol' of the Hebrew Bible, or the 
              'Paradise' of which Jesus spoke on the cross (Luke 23, 43), seen 
              now as a place of purification and preparation for the final Kingdom, 
              when all humanity would be united in love for a present and unhidden 
              God. There is no need to speak of wholly disembodied souls. One 
              can rather see the possibility of different sorts of embodiment 
              for the same subjects of action and enjoyment, culminating in the 
              pure spiritual Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p> Thus the Christian view of the self is that it emerges from the 
              material order, but it is destined for a spiritual order. It is 
              born in a 'body of death', oriented to the desires of the senses 
              and the pride of the mind, doomed to frustration and the ultimate 
              failure of its earthly hopes. But it is destined to receive a 'resurrection' 
              of body of spirit, and for Christians that is the teaching Christ 
              comes to inaugurate. The apostles saw Jesus after the death of his 
              material body in his spirit-body. They believed that they received 
              the Spirit in a new and powerfully transforming way through loving 
              devotion to him. The Divine Spirit began to shape their spirit-bodies, 
              so that they would become 'like Christ', and would eventually be 
              wholly united to God through and in Him. At the end of historical 
              time, they believed, Christ would return and transform the whole 
              material realm into its true spiritual form, wherein all humans, 
              living and dead, could achieve their true destiny.</p>
            <p> The traditional view of the soul uses Aristotle's philosophy in 
              an imaginative way to show how the soul is both essentially embodied 
              and yet not irrevocably tied to a specific material body. The traditional 
              view of resurrection arguably remains too materialistic, however, 
              and a return to the Pauline teaching of a spiritual body points 
              the way to an interpretation, at once newer and yet more Biblical, 
              of how the spiritual realm can be seen as the reality of which this 
              material realm is a shadow and corruption. Existence in that spiritual 
              Kingdom, ruled by a clearly known and worshipped God, beginning 
              even now in this material life, is the proper object of Christian 
              hope.</p>

            <p><b><a name="rsd"></a>The Nature of the Self: A Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              Understanding</b></p>
            <p>By Ravindra Svarupa dasa</p>
            <p><b>The sparks of God</b></p>
            <p>The soul, or self (<i>atma</i>), is described as a separated, minute 
              fragment of God, the Supersoul (<i>paramatma</i>). God is like a 
              fire; the individual souls, sparks of the fire. As the analogy suggests, 
              the self and the Superself are simultaneously one with and different 
              from each other. They are the same in quality, for both the soul 
              and the Supersoul are <i>brahman</i>, spirit. Yet they differ in 
              quantity, since the Superself (<i>param brahman</i> &#8213; supreme 
              <i>brahman</i> &#8213; in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 10.12) is infinitely 
              great while the individual selves are infinitesimally small.</p>
            <p> In the <i>Upanisads</i> some texts assert the identity between 
              the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, while others speak of 
              the difference between them. The way the Vaisnava Vedanta resolves 
              this apparent contradiction recognises identity and difference as 
              equally real.</p>
            <p> Such a reconciliation is conveyed in the <i>Katha Upanisad</i> 
              (2.2.13) in the words <i>nityo nityanam cetannas cetananam eko bahunam 
              yo vidadhati kaman</i>. ('There is one eternal being out of many 
              eternals, one conscious being out of many conscious beings. It is 
              the one who provides for the needs of the many.') This text states, 
              in effect, that there is a class division in transcendence. It says 
              that there are two categorically different types of eternal, conscious-hence, 
              spiritual-beings. One category is singular in number (<i>nityo</i>), 
              a set with only one member. This, then, is the category of God, 
              who is one without a second. The other class is plural (<i>nityanam</i>), 
              containing innumerable members. This is the category of the souls. 
              The members of both classes are <i>brahman</i>, spirit. Yet one 
              of them is unique, peerless, in a class by Himself, for He is the 
              singular independent self-sustaining sustainer of all others. Each 
              of the others possesses a multitude of peers, and all of them alike 
              are intrinsically dependent upon the one. The one is the absolute, 
              the many are relative.</p>
            <p><b>The energies of the Absolute</b></p>
            <p>Fundamental to the Vaisnava Vedanta is the doctrine that the Absolute 
              Truth possesses energies. (The impersonalistic Advaita Vedanta, 
              in contrast, denies the reality of the energies.) The energies are 
              divided into different categories; one of them is comprised of the 
              innumerable individual souls.</p>
            <p> The 'Absolute Truth' denotes that from which everything emanates, 
              by which it is sustained, and to which it finally returns. The products 
              of the Absolute are thought of as its <i>sakti</i>, its energy or 
              potency. Heat and light, for example, are considered the energies 
              of fire. Just as the sun projects itself everywhere by its radiation 
              yet remains apart, so the Absolute expands its own energies to produce 
              (and, in a fashion, to become) the world while remaining separate 
              from it.  Unlike the sun, the Absolute can emanate unlimited energy 
              and remain undiminished. (The arithmetic of the Absolute: One minus 
              one equals one.) In short, while nothing is different from God, 
              God is different from everything.</p>
            <p> The host of souls makes up the category of divine energy called 
              the <i>tatastha-sakti</i>. <i>Tata</i> means 'bank', as of a river 
              or lake. <i>Tatastha</i> means 'situated on the bank'. The souls 
              are characterised as marginal or borderline energy because they 
              are, as it were, between two worlds. They can dwell within either 
              of the two major energies, the internal (<i>antaranga-sakti</i>) 
              and the external (<i>bahiranga-sakti</i>). The internal potency 
              is also known as the spiritual energy (<i>cit-sakti</i>), and the 
              external potency is also called the material energy (<i>maya-sakti</i>). 
              The internal potency expands as the transcendental realm, the eternal 
              kingdom of God. The external potency expands as the material world, 
              which is sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest.</p>
            <p> Because souls are spiritual, their original home is the spiritual 
              kingdom. Almost all souls dwell there. These are called eternally 
              liberated souls. Only a tiny minority of souls inhabit this material 
              world. These are called fallen, or conditioned, souls.</p>
            <p> Souls are small samples of God. Hence they possess a minute quantity 
              of that freedom which God possesses in full. Although they are eternal, 
              full of knowledge and bliss, and although their dharma, or essential 
              nature, is to serve God, they may still, in the exercise of that 
              freedom, wilfully turn away from divine service. Thereupon these 
              souls fall into the inhospitable realm of the external, material 
              energy.</p>
            <p> Because souls are constitutionally servants, even the rebellious 
              souls remain under God's control, but that control is now exercised 
              indirectly and unfavourably through the agency of material nature. 
              Souls do not have the freedom not to be controlled by God, but they 
              do choose freely how they wish to be controlled. Those who will 
              not voluntarily be controlled by the Lord are controlled involuntarily 
              by material nature. For this reason, spiritual souls become incarcerated 
              within matter. Under the superintendence of the Lord, there is a 
              confluence of the marginal and the external energies, and the creation 
              arises.</p>
            <p><b>Spirits in the material world</b></p>
            <p>The presence of spirit within the material world is disclosed immediately 
              to us by consciousness. Consciousness is the symptom of the soul. 
              It is the current or the energy of the soul. Consciousness does 
              not arise as a by-product of the material energy. A material object 
              like a table or chair is entirely an object and in no way a subject. 
              It does not undergo experiences. It has no significance for itself. 
              An embodied soul, a living being, on the other hand, is a subject; 
              it has significance for itself as well as for others; it undergoes 
              experiences. The claim that the soul is an unknowable 'metaphysical 
              entity' beyond all possible experience is simply false. Not only 
              do we experience the soul; the soul is the very condition for our 
              having any experiences at all.</p>
            <p> Thus, souls are fundamental, irreducible entities in the world. 
              Each living, conscious being is of a different category from the 
              material energy which embodies and surrounds it. The <i>Upanisads</i> 
              declare: <i>aham brahmasmi</i>, I am not this body. Human beings 
              achieve their full potential when they realise this.</p>
            <p> The material elements, of which living bodies are made, are traditionally 
              given as eight: earth, water, fire, ether, mind, intelligence and 
              false ego. They are arranged in sequence from the grossest to the 
              subtlest, that is, from the most apparent to our senses to the least. 
              The first five are the gross elements (<i>maha-bhuta</i>-s); the 
              last three, the subtle elements (s<i>uksma-bhuta</i>-s). The gross 
              elements become more intelligible to us when translated as: solids, 
              liquids, gases, radiant energy and space. The subtle elements, taken 
              together, make up what we in the West generally call the 'mind'. 
              The subtle element <i>manas</i>, or mind, is the locus of habit, 
              of normal thinking, feeling and willing according to one's established 
              mind-set. <i>Buddhi</i>, or intelligence, is the higher faculty 
              of discrimination and judgement; it determines mind-sets and comes 
              to the fore when we undergo conversions or paradigm shifts. <i>Ahamkara</i>, 
              or the sense of self, is the faculty by which the embodied soul 
              assumes a false or illusory identity in the material world.</p>
            <p> Conditioned souls attain human form after transmigrating upward 
              through the scale of beings; thereupon they become capable of self-realisation 
              and liberation. Liberation means giving up false identification 
              of the self with the gross and subtle material coils and regaining 
              one's original spiritual form as a servant of God.</p>
            <p> Even in the conditioned state, the soul always remains a spiritual 
              being. Like a dreamer who projects his identity onto an illusory, 
              dream-self, the conditioned soul acquires a false self of matter. 
              Although the self is by nature eternal, full of knowledge and full 
              of bliss, this nature becomes covered by illusion. Identifying with 
              the material body, the soul is plunged into the nightmare of history, 
              trapped in the whirlpool of repeated birth and death (<i>mrtyu-samsara</i>). 
              This false identification by the embodied souls with their psychophysical 
              coverings is the cause of all their suffering.</p>
            <p> The quest by conditioned souls for happiness in this world inevitably 
              fails. The eternal souls naturally seek eternal happiness, yet they 
              seek it where all happiness is temporary. The fulfilment of the 
              most common and basic desire, that of self-preservation, has not 
              once met with success. Indeed, the deluded souls do not know that 
              matters are just the opposite of the way they seem. Gratification 
              of the senses is in fact the generator of suffering, not happiness. 
              This is because each act of sense gratification intensifies the 
              soul's false identification with the body. Consequently, when the 
              body undergoes disease, senescence and death, the materially absorbed 
              living beings experience all these as happening to themselves. Death 
              is an illusion they have imposed upon themselves owing to their 
              desire to enjoy in this world. So enjoying, their agony continues 
              unabated. A mind brimming with unfulfilled yearnings propels them, 
              at the time of death, into new material bodies, to begin another 
              round.</p>
            <p><b>Recovering the authentic self</b></p>
            <p>Fallen souls have been granted a false material identity because 
              they reject their authentic spiritual identity. The traces of that 
              rejection are found everywhere. We see that all organisms, from 
              microbes on up, are driven by the mechanism of desire and hate, 
              by 'approach' and 'avoidance'. This duality is the reverberation 
              of the original sinful will that propelled them into this world. 
              The original sinful desire is: 'Why can't I be God?' And the original 
              sinful hate, 'Why should Krsna be God?'</p>
            <p> When souls evince the desire to become the Lord, the Lord responds 
              by granting them the illusion of independent lordship. They enter 
              the material kingdom, to be provided with a sequence of false identities 
              &#8213; costumes fabricated out of the material energy &#8213; along 
              with an inventory of objects which they think they can dominate 
              and enjoy. Even so, the Lord accompanies them in their wanderings, 
              dwelling in their hearts as He works to bring about their eventual 
              rectification and return from exile. When the soul in the depth 
              of his being, again turns to God, the Lord makes all arrangements 
              for his inauthentic, illusory life to end.</p>
            <p> The renovation of real life is called <i>bhakti-yoga</i> &#8213; 
              reconnecting the souls with the Supersoul (<i>yoga</i>) by loving 
              devotional service (<i>bhakti</i>). <i>Bhakti</i> rests upon the 
              principle that desire and activity are not in themselves bad. The 
              soul itself is the source of desire and activity. The original, 
              pure desire of the soul is to satisfy the senses of the Lord. This 
              is called <i>prema</i>, or love. When souls contact matter, their 
              love becomes transformed into lust (<i>kama</i>), which is the desire 
              to satisfy one's own senses. The practice of <i>bhakti-yoga</i> 
              reconverts lust into love. Desire is not suppressed or repressed; 
              it is purified. One may call this 'sublimation', but it should be 
              understood that when desire is thus sublimated it rests in its natural 
              and aboriginal state.</p>
            <p> The world, the body with its senses and the sense objects are 
              not to be enjoyed, but neither are they to be renounced. The world 
              is God's energy, and it should not be decried as false or evil. 
              Rather, the elements of this world are to be engaged in divine service. 
              When that is done, the veil of illusion is lifted, and everything 
              and everyone are seen in their true identity: in relationship to 
              God. The way to see divinity everywhere and in everything is to 
              utilise everything in the Lord's service. God is the first of fact, 
              but our materially contaminated senses cannot perceive Him. When, 
              however, the senses become purified by being engaged in the Lord's 
              service, they regain their capacity to perceive God directly.</p>
            <p> Such purified souls are fully joyful. They neither hanker nor 
              lament. Their happiness does not depend upon the course of circumstance. 
              They see all living beings as the same. They see that all the agony 
              and hopelessness of the world is exorcised when the illusion that 
              has rendered us oblivious to our own identity is dispelled, and 
              they engage themselves in the highest welfare work of rousing sleeping 
              souls from their nightmare. For themselves, they take no mind of 
              what becomes of the future of their lives.</p>
            <p> Because they have no material desires, there is no further birth 
              for them in this world. Instead, they attain their original spiritual 
              forms in the kingdom of God, spiritual bodies suitable for pastimes 
              of love with the Lord.</p>
            <p> The Absolute Truth has both an impersonal and a personal feature, 
              but the personal feature is the last word of Godhead. To say the 
              Absolute is a person is to say that it has senses (<i>indriya</i>-s). 
              Traditionally, the senses are ten: those through which the world 
              acts upon us (instruments of hearing, touching, seeing, tasting 
              and smelling), and those through which we act upon the world (instruments 
              of manipulation, locomotion, sound production, reproduction and 
              evacuation). The mind is often considered the eleventh sense. A 
              body, accordingly, may be thought of as an array of senses organised 
              around a centre of consciousness. Thus, to say that the Absolute 
              is a person is to say that the Absolute has body or form.</p>
            <p> The body of God is not material. It is a spiritual or transcendental 
              form &#8213; <i>sat-cit-ananda-vigraha</i>, an eternal form of bliss 
              and knowledge. Though differentiated by limbs or parts, a spiritual 
              body is nevertheless completely unified and identical with its own 
              possessor. Therefore, in God, there is no difference between body 
              and soul, mind and body, soul and mind. Every limb or part of that 
              body can perform all functions of every other limb.</p>
            <p> Because the Absolute is a person, the souls, the offspring of 
              God, are also persons, and they fully manifest their authentic identity 
              only in relationship with the Supreme Person. When conditioned souls 
              act under the impetus of sense gratification, their bodies evolve 
              materially. But when the souls act in their constitutional position, 
              their love toward God displays itself as the soul's proper spiritual 
              bodies. Thus, the selves achieve their full personal identity and 
              self-expression as lovers of  God.</p>
            <p> All relationships in this world are dim and perverted reflections 
              of their real prototypes in the kingdom of God. The taste or flavour 
              of a relationship is called <i>rasa</i> (literally, 'juice'). It 
              is said that there are five primary <i>rasa</i>s a soul can have 
              toward the Lord. In order of increasing intimacy, they are passive, 
              adoration, servitorship, fraternal, paternal and conjugal.</p>
            <p> God and His devotees engage in eternal pastimes of loving exchanges 
              in spiritual forms that are sheer embodiments of <i>rasa</i>. Such 
              bodies are the unmediated concrete expressions of spiritual ecstasies. 
              These unceasing, uninterrupted, ever-increasing variegated ecstasies 
              are non-different from the souls and from the spiritual bodies that 
              bear them. The forms and activities of the Lord and His devotees 
              all possess transcendental specificity and variegatedness. The forms 
              of love are not abstractions and their relations are not allegories. 
              In the kingdom of God life is infinitely more full, vivid, and real 
              than anything of the thin shadows that flicker here, on and off. 
              Here, we are not what we are. There, we are truly ourselves again 
              because we are truly God's.</p>
