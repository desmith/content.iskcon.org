              Cracknell</a></p>
            <p><i>This paper summarises the content of four seminars Kenneth Cracknell 
              gave to devotees over the past three years, two in Cambridge, one 
              in Belgium and one in Los Angeles. His analysis of the four principles 
              of interfaith dialogue are very practical and devotees have found 
              them most useful in their meetings with people of faith. His further 
              elaboration on the future of religion addresses, among other things, 
              the issue of mission and dialogue, which seems to present an obvious 
              contradiction but which may be more of a paper tiger. Kenneth's 
              wealth of experience in relationship with people of other faiths 
              and his subsequent maturity of understanding, provide an important 
              yet simple and concise presentation on the basis of contemporary 
              interfaith dialogue.</i></p>
            <p>My involvement with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              stems first of all from dealing with issues of religious freedom. 
              Some proposals being put before the European Parliament in Strasbourg 
              in 1984 were designed to limit the powers of so-called sects and 
              new religious movements to make and keep converts in Western Europe. 
              These proposals, clearly inspired by the anti-cult movement, were 
              so half-baked as to be ludicrous (I remember very well reading them 
              for the first time on a long distance bus coming into London. As 
              we rounded Hyde Park Corner I said to myself, 'Well, this document 
              is not going anywhere.') Yet the fateful combination of a European 
              Parliamentarian who thought he could make his reputation on this 
              issue and some influential people in high places, meant that the 
              Strasbourg Assembly would take them seriously. </p>
            <p>As a servant of the British Council of Churches at that time, I 
              wrote a position document for our Executive Committee. The church 
              leaders who composed that Executive saw immediately the threat to 
              religious freedom it posed by the Cottrell proposals and supported 
              the stand I was about to take. Thus I became the friend of all new 
              religious movements whose only offence was to want to proclaim their 
              message and to gather communities of believers. (It should go without 
              saying that I did not become the friend of those groups who were 
              in breach of existing Criminal Codes in European countries). Among 
              those most in the sights of the Cottrell proposals was naturally 
              the Hare Krishna movement, 'Jezebels in yellow dresses', as they 
              were called at that time by a Northern Irish political and religious 
              leader. I made my first visit to Bhaktivedanta Manor and soon realised 
              that I was not dealing with a 'new religious movement' but an ancient 
              form of Hindu devotional philosophy, known more properly as Gaudiya 
              Vaishnavism. And I came to respect the integrity and the knowledge 
              of the ISKCON leadership with whom I worked in the Cottrell time.</p>
            <p> That might have been that, except for an invitation which reached 
              my desk in London from Northern Ireland. To be sure Irish churches 
              were members of the British Council of Churches, but in the eight 
              years that I had spent in serving other member churches, in Scotland 
              and Wales as well as England, no invitation to discuss interfaith 
              matters had ever reached me from the Irish church. Obviously they 
              had other concerns, for the civil disturbances were at their height 
              during this period. But here was an invitation from Saunaka Rishi 
              Dasa in Belfast to come to Ireland, to stay at the Hare Krishna 
              centre in Lough Erne, to travel with him in order to make contacts 
              with bishops of both the Roman Catholic and the Anglican churches, 
              to visit Trinity College in Dublin and to join in interfaith dialogue 
              situations as and when they arose. Among these I remember vividly 
              a group of Cistercian monks talking with Vaisnava devotees, not 
              so much about prayer and spirituality as contemporary farming techniques. 
              I immensely enjoyed my time on the island as well, becoming aware 
              of the worshipping life of the community and being invited to expound 
              my understanding of God and God's ways within the teaching framework 
              of the life of the community. The food was also just wonderful. 
              But above all there began my close friendship with Saunaka Rishi 
              Dasa which has led to a profound set of encounters with a religious 
              tradition very different from my own, but in which I have felt the 
              Spirit of the living God.</p>
            <p> From this friendship have arisen opportunities to engage with 
              Vaisnava devotees in the issues set out in this article. Four of 
              them are significant: one in Belgium, two in Cambridge and one in 
              Los Angeles. At the first and the last of these I was the guest 
              of the Society: the two in Cambridge, members of the Communication 
              department conference were our guests at Wesley House. Saunaka invited 
              me to address the first two gatherings on the principles of interfaith 
              dialogue. This is the material which forms the first part of the 
              article. On the second two occasions it seemed good to engage the 
              devotees with a more theoretical topic (one, though, which has profound 
              practical implications). This material forms the second part of 
              this article.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Part One: The Principles of Interfa<span class="maintextsubhead">i</span>th 
              <span class="maintextsubhead">D</span>ialogue</p>
            <p>First, <i>dialogue begins when people meet each other.</i> Unfortunately, 
              this is not a blindingly obvious truism. Sadly, very many people 
              believe themselves to be experts on other people's faith and spirituality 
              solely on the basis of having read a newspaper article about them. 
              Even scholarly persons become 'experts' on Hinduism or Islam by 
              working in their studies and libraries but without encountering 
              real live Hindus or Muslims. But dialogue does not begin when the 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> meets the Bible, or when Confucianism is compared 
              with Christianity. Dialogue takes place only when an actual Vaishnava 
              meets face to face with an actual Christian, or when real followers 
              of Confucius sit down together with real disciples of Jesus. Dialogue 
              is about people not systems, and it takes place between persons 
              not books. And it must be a real meeting between individual men 
              and women, without stereotypical prejudices and premature pigeonholing, 
              for other people will forever remain opaque to us if we are determined 
              to classify them and to label them. Martin Buber got it right, decades 
              before the contemporary interfaith dialogue movements got under 
              way: dialogue (<i>Zwiesprache</i>, he called it) takes place 'between 
              one open-hearted person and another'.  Such dialogue can happen 
              at any time: between two neighbours, two fathers at a PTA, at a 
              wedding or in a restaurant. It can also be highly structured as 
              in the case of a Vaisnava-Christian weekend in January 1996 (a report 
              of this can be found in this issue). But at whatever level it always 
              involves people rather than books.</p>
            <p> Second, <i>dialogue is about building up trust in the other person 
              and learning to tell the truth about another religious tradition</i>. 
              Chiefly this is achieved through listening. An old Rabbi said that 
              God gave us two ears and one mouth, so that our hearing may be twice 
              as much as our speaking. And how much listening we all have to do! 
              All studies of inter-group relations point to apparently inherent 
              needs to caricature and stereotype non-members of particular groups, 
              'the outsiders'. It seems that such tendencies are acerbated when 
              religion is the chief factor in forming group consciousness. So, 
              from the 'inside' of Christianity we murmur about the legalist attitudes 
              of Judaism, the stark monotheism of Islam, the idolatry of Hinduism, 
              the militancy of Sikhism, the atheism of Buddhism and the brainwashed 
              gullibility of followers of new religious movements. Yet an encounter 
              in some depth with followers of any of these paths will put an end 
              to such glib generalisations. Jews believe in love and forgiveness 
              just as much as Christians; Muslims have often penetrated deeply 
              into the meaning of what it means to call God 'the merciful, the 
              compassionate'; very many Hindus are entirely monotheist and no 
              more idolatrous than Christians who may use crucifixes and icons 
              in their devotional life; few people are more gentle or generous 
              than followers of the Guru Nanak; Buddhists have much to teach Christians 
              about 'selflessness' and 'detachment' (the Buddha's silence about 
              God is not atheism as we know it). My own long experience with ISKCON 
              devotees tells me that they are as rational and clearheaded as Christian 
              believers, no more and no less (we have irrational and wooly-headed 
              Christians too).</p>
            <p> But such ideas and conceptions cannot be a matter of mere assertion 
              from some expert or other if people are fundamentally to change 
              their minds and hearts and get rid of their prejudices. Only personal 
              encounter in some depth enables us to hold more generous and honest 
              convictions about other religious paths and ways. Only personal 
              knowledge can enable us to speak the whole truth and nothing other 
              than the truth about their followers.</p>
            <p> Third, <i>dialogue enables us to work together for the proximate 
              goal of a better human community.</i> To be sure, in our meeting 
              with other people and learning more about our religious ways we 
              will discover profound differences as well as common ground. (Interfaith 
              dialogue is not about saying that all religions are the same, though 
              some people have thought so).  These differences often turn on the 
              ultimate nature and destiny of the self, the soul, the human spirit. 
              (Hence the importance of the recent Vaisnava-Christian dialogue: 
              'The Nature of the Self'). <i>Nibbana</i> and personal salvation 
              in a heavenly realm are incompatible visions and irreconcilable 
              final destinies. But meanwhile Hindus and Christians, along with 
              Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains live in a world of threatening 
              ecological disaster, in which there are finite and diminishing resources, 
              violence and war, drug dependence and neurosis. The religious vision 
              and experience of all humanity is needed now as never before if 
              we are to avoid our cosmic cataclysm. No doubt 'religion' is a source 
              of fanaticism, conflict, bigotry, vicious hatred (on religious 'systems' 
              see below) , it often functions as the bearer of racist, classist, 
              sexist ideology, and is capable of manipulation by malign and unscrupulous 
              persons. But more, much more, it is the treasure-house and repository 
              of the human spirit at its best, or at its most inspired. Try these 
              visions for the creation of peace and the dispelling of fanaticism 
              (so central to the message of the late Yitzhak Rabin): from the 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 11.55, 'Have no hatred for any being at all; 
              for all who do this shall come to me'; from the <i>Qur'an,</i> 'Do 
              not strut about the land with insolence; surely you cannot cleave 
              the earth or attain the height of the mountains in stature.' (<i>Surah</i> 
              17.37); from Buddhism in the<i> Itivuttaka</i>, verse 27, 'None 
              of the means employed to acquire religious merit has a sixteenth 
              part of the value of loving kindness.'; from Judaism, the words 
              of the Prophet Micah, 'Do justice, love, mercy and walk humbly with 
              your God.' (Mic. 6.8) and from Christianity, 'Though I give my body 
              to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing.' (1 Corinthians, 
              13.3).</p>
            <p> Similar wisdoms and aspirations in each tradition speak of working 
              as communities of faith for the feeding of the hungry, the ending 
              of drug dependency, the overcoming of racism and sexism. And, even 
              more to the point, we have already seen such programmes implemented. 
              I think for example of the World Congress of Religion for Peace 
              (WCRP), not only internationally, but in the specific context of 
              South Africa, and remember how my friends Farid Izaak, a Muslim 
              from the Cape Coloured community, and Gerry Lubbe, an Afrikaner 
              pastor, shared the same prison cell, having marched together to 
              protest apartheid. I think of a visit I made several years ago to 
              the Food Bank of the Interfaith Council of the Greater Metropolitan 
              Washington Council of Churches, where people of many faith traditions 
              came together to help the cold and hungry, only fourteen blocks 
              from the White House. I think of a Conference in London about drug 
              abuse and dependency where Sikhs, Buddhists and Hindus taught westerners 
              yet again about meditation and healthful patterns of living.</p>
            <p> Fourth, <i>dialogue becomes the way of authentic mutual witness.</i> 
              The question of mission and evangelism in relation to interfaith 
              dialogue is never far from the surface when Christians get together. 
              Nor was it far from the Krishna devotees in either Los Angeles or 
              Cambridge, because Gaudiya Vaisnavism is essentially an evangelistic 
              movement with the mission of raising Krsna consciousness throughout 
              the western world. Is it really possible for adherents of missionary 
              faiths to have dialogue with one another, or are we forever committed 
              to monological proclamation? Many issues raise themselves here. 
              What, for example, is mission? If it is synonymous with proselytism 
              and propaganda (the desire to make clones of what one is oneself), 
              mission will become demonic in ways which the Jews knew only too 
              well in old Christendom. Forcible conversions, pogroms, ghettos 
              and a 'final solution' make many Jews fear the very word 'mission' 
              on the lips of Christians. Similar considerations make the term 
              'crusade' obnoxious to many Muslims and continue to make it impossible 
              for a Christian 'missionary' to gain a visa for India or to cross 
              the borders of Burma.</p>
            <p> Yet, mission may be a much more neutral term. Large business corporations 
              spend months in preparing their mission statements with the result 
              that Coca Cola, for example, boasts of its mission to bring its 
              product to every town and village in the whole world. All this makes 
              the point that Christians do not have to repudiate the 'mission' 
              of the church nor Vaisnavas the mission of ISKCON when they get 
              involved with interfaith dialogue. All they need to do is be honest 
              and say that they wish to share their faith and to bear their witness. 
              And in dialogue they will be asked to do just that.</p>
            <p> My own experience is that I am asked continually to give a reason 
              for the hope that is in me. Indeed many of the people I met recently 
              in Los Angeles wanted to ask about Jesus in some way, with the real 
              hard questions being asked. (How can any person bear another's sins, 
              and why do Christians want to avoid their own guilt instead of doing 
              something about it by reparation and fundamental change of lifestyle 
              and behaviour, thus altering one's <i>karma, </i>and so on). It 
              seems to me that Vaisnavas are better prepared to speak about their 
              faith than many Christians, yet here again interfaith dialogue will 
              present them with questions they have not yet properly faced and 
              challenges that will live with them long after the conversation 
              is over. Situations of interfaith dialogue offer moments for testimony 
              and explanation which have lasting significance to the participants.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Part Two: Dialogue and the Future of Religion</p>
            <p>The most frequent questions put to me at meetings, even after I 
              have laid out the 'Four Principles of Dialogue', concern the motivation 
              for dialogue and the aim or goal of dialogue. Is it a mere exercise 
              in goodwill? Does it have, or ought it to have, a secret agenda 
              like converting the other person ('evangelism has failed, let's 
              try dialogue')? Isn't it a way of uniting all religions into one 
              big mish-mash? I discern in such questions an underlying anxiety 
              about the future either of individual religious denominations or 
              of the future of religion itself.</p>
            <p> One way of responding I have developed is to suggest that we talk 
              about the range of religious possibilities now open to humankind 
              (assuming that we get through the next dangerous decades of impending 
              ecological disasters). I think there are nine things that could 
              happen  (if you can think of any others, or of any variations on 
              the nine I would be delighted to hear from you.) I will set them 
              out first as a list and then comment on each of them.</p>
            1.      Religion in all its manifestations will simply disappear from 
            the face of the earth. 
            <p></p>
            2.      All our existing religious communities will go on much as 
            they are doing now, some disappearing, some new ones arising, but 
            essentially keeping ourselves apart from one another. 
            <p></p>
            <p>3.      All our existing religious communities will go on much 
              as they are doing now, some disappearing, some new ones arising, 
              but becoming a little more co-operative and supporting one another 
              especially in questions of religious freedom.</p>
            4.      Religious research and scholarship will find a way of uniting 
            all religious traditions, making one great world religion in which 
            all religious communities will find a place. 
            <p></p>
            <p>5a.    One religious community will have become so attractive that 
              everyone in the world will have joined it, making one single religious 
              community.</p>
            5b.    One religious community will have become so attractive that 
            most people in the world will have joined it, leaving just a few small 
            survivors. 
            <p></p>
            6.      One religious outlook will so have enlarged and distorted 
            itself so that its religious community will take in quite happily 
            people of other persuasions. 
            <p></p>
            7.      All major strands of religious outlook will so have expanded 
            that each one of them becomes capable of taking others into itself, 
            making a new kind of religious community. 
            <p></p>
            8.      God will act and create something that is utterly beyond our 
            present-day imagination. 
            <p></p>

              <img src="images/FIG1.gif" width="551" height="140"> This outcome 
              has been predicted, if not devoutly wished, by sociologists and 
              psychologists since Marx and Freud. Full-blooded scientism has also 
              felt that it could do without God and evolution has seemed to replace 
              any hypothesis of divine intervention in the affairs of humankind. 
              But religion is 'the opium of the masses' in only one of its aspects 
              and appears as a neurotic illusion only in people who are sick from 
              other causes. The prolonged socialist experiment in Russia and elsewhere 
              did not see a withering of the religious impulse. The ubiquitous 
              reign of the psychotherapists in the USA have in no way diminished 
              Americans' hunger for the divine. One would be hard put to discern 
              the secular triumph over religion in either of these societies, 
              while elsewhere in the world ancient religious traditions are renewing 
              themselves, as in the case of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism. 
              Even in Japan there is 'the rush hour of the gods' as one observer 
              has called it, and Africa is rapidly becoming the most Christianised 
              continent in the world. It does not seem likely that the religions 
              of the world are on the way out.</p>

            <p>Indeed there is no doubt that religious traditions are powerful 
              in the affairs of humankind. John Bowker has written about 'religions 
              as systems' demonstrating that just as all systems have boundaries 
              and limits, so also do 'religions'. He believes it would be possible 
              to draw a map of the world showing where the contiguous religious 
              boundaries are, and then to predict that these meeting points will 
              be areas of serious human conflict even to the point of bloodshed. 
              He is, of course, utterly correct in this: we have only to think 
              of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia (Orthodox, Muslim, Catholic), Ireland 
              (Catholic, Protestant), Sri Lanka (Hindu, Buddhist), Israel and 
              its Muslim neighbours and India with its rise of new fundamentalisms. 
              Bowker also reminds us that at the centre of the systems are the 
              appointed (or self-appointed) guardians of the tradition. Figures 
              like the Pope and the Curia, the Southern Baptist Convention, the 
              Ayatollahs, the Rabbinate, the Pundits of Indian tradition, all 
              know where the boundaries are and what the 'perils' are of crossing 
              them. The general rules for them to give their followers are 'stay 
              home', 'don't mix with the others', 'keep the food laws' and above 
              all, 'don't marry out'. Their views may well be that all religious 
              traditions will be around far into the future and that big walls 
              need to be put up between each community. Good fences, as Robert 
              Frost wrote, make good neighbours. Interfaith dialogue has no priority 
              for such guardians of the tradition, whether at the macro level 
              (the Sheiks in Riyadh, the Presbyterian General Assembly in Belfast) 
              or the micro level (most  but not all  local church pastors or 
              temple presidents).</p>

              will go on much as they are doing now, some disappearing, some new

              supporting one another especially in questions of religious freedom.</p>

            <p>This is the position most often held by men and women who have 
              been seriously challenged by the vision of a multi-faith society, 
              yet who have deep commitments to their own religious communities. 
              Such views often lie behind the formation of Councils of Churches 
              and Interfaith Councils. There will be immense goodwill involved, 
              and this will almost certainly mean things like interchange of visits, 
              visiting speakers and festivals during 'One World Week'. At the 
              national level in the UK it has led to the forming of the influential 
              Interfaith Network.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">4.   Religious research and scholarship 
              will find a way of uniting all religious traditions, making one 
              great world religious system in which all religious communities

              <img src="images/FIG4.gif" width="258" height="213"> </p>
            <p>This is the dream which sustained many of the pioneers in the world 
              interfaith movement, and which in developed and nuanced form still 
              motivates men and women in interfaith dialogue. It takes at least 
              two forms. One is a deliberate and careful 'syncretism' of all the 
              best elements in the world's religious traditions often using some 
              mystical basis to make the choice, as in the 'perennial philosophy'. 
              A well-known form of this kind of syncretism is 'theosophy'. The 
              other form is a deliberately constructed metaphysical framework 
              or ideology in which all religious truth may find its place. Certain 
              forms of Hinduism have claimed to offer just such a metaphysic as 
              do forms of Christian theology, for example that of Schleiermacher 
              or John Hick. One Christian church, larger in the USA than in the 
              UK believes itself to offer an institutional framework or ideology, 
              namely the Unitarian or Unitarian Universalist Church.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">5a. One religious community will have become 
              so attractive that everyone in the world will have joined it, making

            <p>This is the foundational belief of the great missionary religions 
              whether they be Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist. It is clear 
              from the present Pope's new book, <i>On Crossing the Threshold of 
              Hope</i>, that he believes that one day all the world will become 
              Roman Catholic. I live among Southern Baptists who believe that 
              one day 'every knee will bow at the name of Jesus' and they are 
              sending thousands of missionaries each year to all parts of the 
              world. I suppose the Mormons believe the same, for their missionary 
              effort is unabated. Most Muslims likewise believe that one day the 
              whole world will become the Dar as-salaam, the house of Islam, instead 
              of the Dar ul-harb, the house of war. No doubt readers will be able 
              to think of similar notions among Hindus and among Buddhists.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">5b. One religious community will have become 
              so attractive that most people in the world will have joined it,

            <p>This is the modification of position 5a with a touch of realism. 
              One religion will certainly have conquered all the others but space 
              will have to be left for the invincibly stupid and the wilfully 
              obdurate to go on doing their own thing. In a great Christian world 
              where all will owe obedience to the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) there 
              might still be a few hundred thousand ISKCON devotees! Or, alternatively, 
              in a great Hindu world where all people are united in the love of 
              Lord Krsna, there might yet still be a few Franciscans and Jesuits 
              saying Mass!</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">6. One religious outlook will so have enlarged

            <p>This represents a genuine fear on the part of people holding views 
              2 or 3 that this is the way things are going. It may also represent 
              a deliberate decision on the part of some that their religious tradition 
              should be enlarged and modified (they would not use the word distort) 
              so that it could absorb the worship practices or spirituality of 
              another tradition. From one Christian point of view one hears talk 
              of 'Hinduised Christianity' or 'Christianised Hinduism', and people 
              speaking of themselves as 'Christian Buddhists' and 'Buddhist-Christians'. 
              While 'Can a Christian be a Buddhist, too?', is a genuine question, 
              guardians of the faith suspect that quite serious issues in historical 
              Christianity are being overlooked.</p>

              that they have built upon existing areas of overlapping, as well 
              as 'recapitulating' all that is best in their own traditions.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">8. God will act and create something that 
              is utterly beyond our present-day imagination.</p>

              <img src="images/FIG8.gif" width="408" height="173"> </p>
            <p>I give an example of the indication in Christian scriptures that 
              we can only dimly grasp what is in store for us. We are told that 
              we have still to be led into all the truth (John, 16.13). In the 
              present time we can only see 'in a mirror, dimly' (1 Corinthians 
              13.12). It has not yet been revealed what we shall be (1 John 3.2) 
              and we look for a time when 'all creation is set free from its bondage 
              to decay' and when all of us obtain 'the freedom of the glory of 
              the children of God' (Romans, 8.21). He who is the 'Eschatos' as 
              well as the 'Protos', the End of all Ends, the Omega for all the 
              Alphas (Revelation, 21.6) still has to make 'all things new' (Revelation, 
              21.5). 'You ain't seen nothing yet', is thus an ungrammatical but 
              accurate guide to our present situation as Christians. I think that 
              there are indications in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and in other sacred 
              writings that the future is not as we currently suppose and that 
              for Vaisnavas the situation is not dissimilar. 'You ain't seen nothing 
              yet', applies to all who believe that God is active and working 
              our God's own divine plan.</p>
            <p> Doubtless it takes a certain courage to move forward into this 
              unknown new future; nevertheless, we need to contemplate this particular 
              leap of faith. For myself, there is both exhilaration and invigoration 
              in undertaking theology in interfaith contexts, and like many others 
              I become more sure of my faith in Christ as I share what little 
              understanding I have of Him with my neighbours and friends in other 
              traditions. In turn, they enable me to see more of His significance 
              in terms which often match and sometimes surpass those I am accustomed 
              to. I truly believe I ain't seen nothing yet and invite my Vaisnava 
              friends to a similar exciting future.</p>
