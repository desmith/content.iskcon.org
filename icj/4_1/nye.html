  <p><i>Malory Nye has become the leading academic commentator 
    on the issues surrounding the campaign to protect worship at Bhaktivedanta 
    Manor, ISKCON's most popular temple in England. The following article outlines 
    the fifteen-year-old history of the dispute involving ISKCON members, local 
    residents, the Hindu community, local and national government, the media, 
    the courts and two public enquiries. This article has been updated with information 
    about the success of the campaign because of the recent decision by John Gummer, 
    the British Government's Minister for the Environment, to support the use 
    of Bhaktivedanta Manor for public worship.</i></p>
  <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
  <p>On the festival of Janmasthami in August 1994 
    (which happened to coincide with the Bank Holiday Monday) thousands of British 
    Gujarati Hindus visited the 'Hare Krishna centre' of Bhaktivedanta Manor in 
    rural Hertfordshire. Large numbers of these visitors queued up to sit in a 
    marquee to watch a short film entitled <i>One Step From Victory</i>. In the 
    film they were told a brief history of Bhaktivedanta Manor, and the political 
    campaign which was being fought on their behalf to keep the place open to 
    visitors. They were also encouraged to stand up and join the fight, goaded 
    by clips from the Oscar-winning film of Mahatma Gandhi's struggle against 
    tyranny.</p>
  <p> The irony of the use of extracts from 
    a British-made film &#8213; directed by an Englishman (Richard Attenborough), 
    and with an English actor (Ben Kingsley) representing the archetypal Hindu 
    campaigner &#8213; was perhaps not lost on an audience of British Hindus who 
    felt under threat from their own society because of their skin colour, their 
    culture and their religion. These British Hindus were then encouraged to be 
    'warriors in the fight' to save their temple, in a battle which 'would not 
    be fought with swords or arrows, but with plastic' (i.e. credit cards). As 
    Hindus they should financially support this Hare Krishna temple which was 
    (and had been for over ten years) under threat of closure from their local 
    council.</p>
  <p> Bhaktivedanta Manor is ISKCON's (the 
    'Hare Krishna' Movement's) most important site in the UK &#8213; it is an 
    English country house which was converted into a temple and theological college 
    in the early 1970s. The threat to this site has been widely reported in the 
    local, national and international press.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1] </a> Widespread use of the building (such as by the 
    visitors at the Janmasthami festival), and particularly the traffic that this 
    generates, had provoked complaints by local residents, which had led ISKCON 
    and Hertsmere Borough Council (the local authority) into a prolonged and very 
    expensive legal battle. Despite a series of legal defeats by ISKCON the site 
    is still used for public worship, but there is great doubt over whether this 
    situation can be maintained in the future.</p>
  <p> In this paper I will be examining 
    the history of this conflict, and discussing some of the most important reasons 
    why the dispute has occurred. In particular I would argue that the cause of 
    the conflict is not (as perhaps one would expect) so much about the use of 
    the Hare Krishna temple as the centre of a 'new religious movement' or 'cult', 
    but rather as a centre of worship by Hindus born into that religious tradition. 
    The campaign for Bhaktivedanta Manor has played an important role in developing 
    the relationship between ISKCON and Indian Hindus. In fact, the sympathy for 
    the Manor aroused among a large majority of Britain's Hindu population has 
    helped ISKCON to take an important place in the establishment of Hinduism 
    in Britain. This paper is therefore part of an examination of the development 
    of British Hinduism, which has looked especially at the use of public religious 
    places (particularly buildings) as significant forums for the construction 
    and establishment of Hindu identities.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2] </a></p>
  <p> Attempts to resolve the conflict have 
    also made a clear and unambiguous demonstration of the role of religion in 
    modern British society. Hindus using Bhaktivedanta Manor claim that they have 
    the right to express their religion in the place of their choice &#8213; that 
    is, they should have the freedom to worship at the Manor if they consider 
    it to be important to them. But under British law such freedom is subject 
    to planning regulations. This position has been challenged by ISKCON at every 
    level in the British courts, and even in the European Court. But the decision 
    has been unequivocal in each case &#8213; religious freedom in Britain is 
    secondary to the laws of planning protection.</p>
            <p><b>ISKCO<span class="maintextsubhead">N</span> in </b><st1:country-region><b>Britain</b></st1:country-region></p>
  <p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
    (ISKCON) was founded in Britain in 1969, as a branch of the movement created 
    two years earlier in the US by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, a seventy-year-old 
    Bengali initiated into the Gaudiya Math of Caitanya Vaisnavism.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""> [3] 
    </a> Prabhupada's intention was to transplant this tradition into the 
    West, to proselytise and create followers of Caitanya (a sixteenth century 
    mystic) and through him of the god Krsna. In Prabhupada's own words, his task 
    was to fulfil Caitanya's prediction that the name of Krsna would be spread 
    into 'every town and village',<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title=""> [4] 
    </a> and this mission in the west entailed seeking devotees of Krishna 
    particularly among those for whom his teachings were quite alien (i.e. white, 
    mainly Christian European / Americans). The converts he made in New York and 
    San Francisco were soon incorporated into an international organisation with 
    himself at its head, called ISKCON. Administration and spiritual leadership 
    of the growing movement was transferred in 1972 to a group of twelve senior 
    devotees called the Governing Body Commission (GBC).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> 
    [5] </a> Before his death in 1977, Prabhupada appointed 
    eleven 'initiating gurus', who were to take on elements of the spiritual leadership 
    of the movement after he had departed.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
title=""> [6] 
    </a></p>
  <p> The foundation of ISKCON in Britain 
    was closely associated with certain members of the pop group The Beatles, 
    particularly George Harrison.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7] </a> ISKCON devotees combined with George Harrison 
    to record the tradition's <i>mahamantra</i>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> 
   [8] </a> which soon became a chart success. Of perhaps 
    more lasting impact was the donation George Harrison made to the movement 
    in 1973 of a mock-Tudor house called Piggotts Manor (built in 1884) which 
    included seventeen acres of ground in the village of Letchmore Heath, which 
    lies in the heart of the upper middle class commuter belt around Watford, 
    approximately fifteen miles north west of London. The house was renamed &#8213; 
    Bhaktivedanta Manor, in honour of the movement's founder who used it regularly 
    when he visited Britain &#8213; and converted into a place of study and worship 
    for Hare Krishna devotees, being officially registered with the local authorities 
    as a theological college. A large room in the house was ritually dedicated 
    as a temple &#8213; statues of Krishna and his consort Radha were installed, 
    and regular worship of these deities has been performed daily for over twenty 
    years.</p>
  <p> The situation of Bhaktivedanta Manor 
    is however, extremely convenient for a local population of Gujarati Hindus<a
href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9] </a> (mainly from East Africa) living in north west 
    London, around Harrow and Wembley. Such Hindus are mainly from predominantly 
    Vaisnavite backgrounds (particularly influenced by Pushtimarg and Swaminarayanism<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10] </a>), but who had little or no experience of the 
    Bengali Caitanya traditions which gave rise to ISKCON. But for various reasons 
    (not all of which are clear) they were drawn to the style of ISKCON worship 
    at Bhaktivedanta Manor.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11] </a></p>
  <p> The temple itself is within easy driving 
    distance of this large Hindu population, which makes it very easy to visit 
    at the weekend. The quality of facilities offered by the Manor compares well 
    with other Hindu temples in the catchment area &#8213; in the seventies and 
    early eighties (when the Manor first became popular) there were only a few 
    temples in existence, and these tended to be either in a state of construction, 
    or otherwise housed in rather poor standard buildings.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title="">[12] </a> (Carey describes cases of Gujarati Hindus who 
    began to visit the Hare Krishna temple in central London in the seventies 
    because it was the only Krishna temple available to them at the time<a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13] </a>). It is quite possible that the rural location 
    of the Manor was an added incentive, making a visit to the temple a welcome 
    day out of London in the countryside. The attitude and commitment of the white 
    British devotees also impressed the Gujarati Hindus who came in contact with 
    them &#8213; what appeared particularly impressive were the devotees' knowledge 
    of Sanskrit along with (a particular strand of) Hindu philosophy. Furthermore, 
    ISKCON had already given a lot of consideration to the teaching of their form 
    of Hinduism to their children, and so Gujaratis bringing up Hindu children 
    in London saw in Bhaktivedanta Manor a place which could provide them with 
    good teaching facilities.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"
title=""> [14] 
    </a></p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>The 
    sources of conflict</b></p>
  <p>By the late 1970s festivals held at the Manor 
    were attracting Indian Hindus in the thousands &#8213; particularly the celebration 
    of Krishna's birthday (Janmasthami) in August, when attendance in the region 
    of 25,000 has been reported. There has, though, been a strongly negative side 
    to this success, which has been manifest in the backlash of the local residents 
    and authorities against the Manor.  Throughout the 1980s, and continuing into 
    the present decade, ISKCON has been in conflict with local residents and particularly 
    with the local Hertsmere Borough Council. Through this struggle ISKCON, and 
    in fact many British Hindus, have been forced to think about the role of their 
    perceived religious and cultural tradition within a predominantly Christian 
    society.</p>
  <p> The development of antagonism between 
    ISKCON and Hertsmere council began formally in 1981, when officials in Hertsmere 
    &#8213; led by complaints from several residents within the village of Letchmore 
    Heath &#8213; issued an enforcement notice against Bhaktivedanta Manor, trying 
    to stop public festivals being held at the Manor.<a href="#_edn15"
name="_ednref15" title="">[15] </a>  ISKCON appealed against this notice and agreement 
    was signed between the parties allowing ISKCON to arrange up to six events 
    throughout the year which involved more than one thousand visitors. Thus the 
    Manor would be allowed to provide festivities on the major festival days (Holi, 
    Janmasthami, Dussera, Diwali and Ramnavami). </p>
  <p> For a few years it appeared that the 
    council had accepted the Manor's status as a place of public worship and that 
    the conflict had disappeared. In the mid 1980s Carey was confident that any 
    problems that may have existed had been resolved, particularly because the 
    costs of a legal battle appeared to discourage both parties from taking the 
    matter to court. But by November 1985 Hertsmere council made it clear that 
    they did not feel the agreed settlement was working, and in that month they 
    issued a High Court writ against the Manor seeking an injunction to prevent 
    ISKCON organising any event which might involve more than a thousand people 
    in any single day. This writ failed in April 1986, with the judge ruling that 
    any attempt to restrict the number of visitors would be impossible. But this 
    decision was soon followed in June the same year by the council making the 
    formal decision to issue a new enforcement notice with the aim of preventing 
    all visitors to the Manor, except for a small number appropriate to its use 
    as a 'theological college'. After a further period of consultation, much of 
    which occurred in the glare of both local and national press, the council 
    served the enforcement notice in January 1987. </p>
  <p> Hertsmere Council argued that such 
    action was necessary because they had received fourteen written complaints 
    from residents living near the Manor. These residents were regularly suffering 
    at each festival from 'diminished amenity', experiencing five mile traffic 
    jams leading to 'congestion in country lanes' and a disturbance of 'the tranquillity 
    of the village'.  Neighbours were finding that their overall 'quality of life' 
    had been 'badly affected by life next-door to the Hare Krishna temple'.</p>
  <p> Whenever there have been large numbers 
    of visitors at the Manor this has obviously created a traffic problem in the 
    surrounding area. As noted above, on some occasions the Manor has attracted 
    as many as 25,000 worshippers visiting over a two-day period (during Janmasthami) 
    &#8213; and nearly all of these visitors needed to travel to Letchmore Heath 
    by car, since the village has very limited public transport facilities. Such 
    numbers are phenomenally large for what is a very small village, but it is 
    important to note that the Manor would not receive this many people at the 
    same time. As is the norm with much Hindu worship, those who visit Bhaktivedanta 
    Manor do not spend more than an hour or two performing their religious devotion, 
    and during days of major festivals there is usually a constant stream of worshippers 
    coming and going from the temple area. The ISKCON authorities at the Manor 
    have also made efforts to alleviate the traffic problems 'to ease any inconvenience 
    that may be caused to the locality', making consultations with local traffic 
    authorities such as the police, the Council and the  Automobile Association 
    (AA) before any event. They also use a large field within the Manor grounds 
    as a temporary car park to accommodate the volume of cars that arrive, and 
    efficient stewards marshal the arrivals to ensure quick and easy access to 
    the Manor from the public road.</p>
  <p> However, the root of the argument 
    between ISKCON and the local council is a disagreement over whether the Manor 
    has been used in ways that were outside of the terms of the planning status 
    originally agreed in 1973 by the council (which was then the Watford Rural 
    District Council). When this permission was given, Bhaktivedanta Manor was 
    registered as a 'residential theological college'.  Clearly its use over the 
    years broke a straightforward interpretation of terms of this permission: 
    in the words of Hertsmere council it had become 'too popular' and a theological 
    college 'had no right to allow outsiders to attend for worship'. Arguing against 
    this Akhandadhi Dasa, the principal of Bhaktivedanta Manor, said in 1991 that 
    the nature of a Hindu theological college was being misunderstood by the local 
    authority:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>We feel that Hertsmere ... have refused to recognise the character 
                of a Hindu theological establishment. In India, a college such 
                as ours will always involve the public. We are a missionary group 
                and our planning determination ... recognises that the college 
                has been set up with the aim of promoting our religion.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This argument is based on two rather fine 
    points. Firstly ISKCON points out that the original planning agreement had 
    allowed that the site would become 'a residential college being a theological 
    college in connection with the promotion of the religion of Krishna Consciousness'.  
    In their opinion the term 'promotion' covered public entertainment and festivals, 
    and therefore ISKCON should be allowed to conduct such activities since they 
    were not in violation of the original agreement.  On this point of law ISKCON 
    has been quite unsuccessful within the British courts, as I will detail below.</p>
  <p> Secondly, ISKCON is stressing that 
    there is a clash of cultural and religious attitudes involved in the conflict. 
    That is, the British authorities are imposing the Christian (particularly 
    Anglican) model of what is appropriate for a theological college onto a non-Christian 
    (Vaisnavite Hindu) movement. It was the expectation of ISKCON that in a largely 
    pluralistic society (such as Britain is) there should be some flexibility 
    within the interpretation of the law insofar as it applies to alternative 
    religious groups.  In ISKCON's opinion there was clearly a great deal of legal 
    ambiguity over what is considered appropriate for a theological college.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16] </a> Again in the words of Akhandadhi Dasa, 'How do 
    you specify how much worship by the Hindu community at our shrine would be 
    considered beyond what is ancillary?'<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17"
title=""> [17] 
    </a></p>
  <p> In fact ISKCON considered that there 
    was a hidden agenda within the council's actions, which were motivated not 
    so much by the <i>number</i> of visitors but by these visitors' skin colour. 
    It was thought to be a common practice for the council to employ a 'team of 
    private investigators' who would stand near the gates of the Manor at the 
    times of busy festivals and monitor the arrival and departure of visitors.<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title="">[18] </a> Frank Ward, a local Labour (opposition) councillor 
    in Hertsmere, who has continually been very sympathetic to the Manor's fight 
    against closure, disclosed in 1985 that these investigators were 'recording 
    figures for Asian and white visitors separately'.<a href="#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" title="">[19] </a> Although the majority of residents at the Manor 
    are ethnically white British, as indeed are the majority of leaders of ISKCON, 
    on practically every festival at the Manor the large majority of visitors 
    are of Indian origin. It has been said by a counsel for ISKCON that the council's 
    problem derives from 'the influx of quite an alien being into their society.  
    These people (Hindus) were alien because of their dress, culture, and sometimes 
    their colour'.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20] </a></p>
  <p> Given the nature of the dispute, 
    the motivation behind monitoring overall attendance levels is quite obvious, 
    but the need to keep a separate record according to skin colour does encourage 
    a conclusion that the Indian-ness of the worshippers is considered by the 
    council to be problematic in some way. However, members of the council and 
    village residents are very keen to stress that their complaints against ISKCON 
    are based on its breach of planning laws and the subsequent disturbance of 
    the village. They show great offence at the suggestion that they are motivated 
    by racism. Indeed, in the 1988 Public Inquiry ISKCON withdrew all allegations 
    against the council of racial and religious prejudice.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>The 
    legal battle</b></p>
  <p>The enforcement notice of 1987, if implemented, 
    would effectively close down Bhaktivedanta Manor as a place of public worship. 
    So far this has not happened, despite a series of successive negative judgements 
    against them in British courts. An appeal was made by ISKCON, followed by 
    a lengthy period of discussion between the parties in which possible solutions 
    to the problem were examined. Two public inquiries were held (in December 
    1988 and February 1989). The recommendations of these inquiries were passed 
    to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Chris Patten, who was asked 
    to make a decision about Hertsmere council's enforcement notice. He ruled 
    on 21 March 1990 that the notice was valid, that there were no justifiable 
    reasons to supersede the planning determination of the Manor and so it should 
    only be used for public worship which was ancillary to its use as a theological 
    college. However, he did allow ISKCON a grace period of two years in which 
    they could find an alternative site for worship and festivals.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21] </a></p>
  <p> ISKCON decided to challenge this decision 
    too, saying they would take their case 'through the Appeal Courts, House of 
    Lords and right up to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary' (Akhandadhi 
    Dasa<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22] </a>). The appeal to the High Court was heard in October 
    1991, at a time which happened to coincide with the Hindu festival of Dussera 
    &#8213; when the defeat by Lord Rama of the evil demon Ravana is celebrated, 
    a figure whom ISKCON devotees described as 'the epitome of attempted abuse 
    of the Lord's property'.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23] </a>  Despite the auspiciousness of the date the judgement 
    still went against ISKCON. The High Court judge, Mr. Justice Kennedy, said 
    that Hertsmere Council's notice was valid and that the points of law argued 
    by ISKCON had 'no substance'.<a
href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24] </a>  In response ISKCON decided to take their case 
    to the Court of Appeal, which is the highest court in British law, again challenging 
    the basis of the decision made by the Department of Environment that the enforcement 
    notice was valid.  This appeal was considered by Lord Justice Glidewell on 
    16 March 1992, who ruled again that there were no legal flaws in the earlier 
    rulings, and thus the legal challenge was lost.<a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title="">[25] </a></p>
  <p> With no further opportunity to appeal 
    within the UK, ISKCON were given the two year grace period originally allowed 
    to them by the Secretary of State, after which, on 16 March 1994, they would 
    have to abide by the notice to no longer allow public worship at the Manor. 
    A further appeal was possible to the European Commission of Human Rights, 
    and this was duly lodged.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>At first we discussed the case in planning terms, Green Belt 
                issues for example, and then at the High Court we talked in legal 
                terms ...  But there are human issues.  We are being denied religious 
                rights.  (Akhandadhi Dasa<a href="#_edn26"
name="_ednref26" title="">[26] </a>)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>However a judgement made by this last court 
    of appeal would not be legally binding within British law, rather a judgement 
    made in ISKCON's favour would merely exert moral pressure on the British government 
    to reverse their earlier decision.</p>
  <p> However, in March 1994 the Commission 
    of Human Rights decided to not allow the appeal to proceed to court, rejecting 
    the grounds of ISKCON's application.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27"
title=""> [27] 
    </a>  In ISKCON's view this rejection was because 'the technicalities 
    of the UK planning laws meant that the issues could not be covered by the 
    Commission'.<a href="#_edn28"
name="_ednref28" title="">[28] </a> The Commission ruled that 'ISKCON's freedom to 
    manifest its religion was prescribed by law'<a href="#_edn29"
name="_ednref29" title="">[29] </a>, but the British planning authorities had given 
    detailed consideration to the religious needs of ISKCON within the planning 
    process. Insofar as there was a civil rights issue involved &#8213; that is 
    a violation of freedom of religion &#8213; the Commission noted that 'freedom 
    of religion as not formal status as a right which is guaranteed in United 
    Kingdom domestic law'<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30] </a>. That is, they could not arbitrate over the issue 
    of planning which is the basis of Hertsmere's case against the Manor, nor 
    could they make a judgement about the right to religious freedom in Britain 
    because there is nothing to guarantee such rights in British law.</p>
  <p> Under British law a special case may 
    be made on religious grounds to set aside specific planning controls. In the 
    opinion of Hertsmere Council, the Department of the Environment and the European 
    Commission, due consideration had been given to the religious needs of Hindus 
    and these were not sufficient to override the planning controls for Letchmore 
    Heath (as a Green Belt and Conservation area). Hence religious needs were 
    only admissible within the confines of existing planning structures.<a href="#_edn31"
name="_ednref31" title="">[31] </a></p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>Alternative 
    solutions</b></p>
  <p>During the years in which these legal battles 
    have been fought ISKCON has continued to attempt to find alternative solutions 
    to the problem. If the notice was upheld, as has indeed happened, then some 
    major change to the Manor would be required. One possible solution was to 
    move the Manor temple to another site with better access which would not be 
    so disruptive to the local neighbourhood (or which had a neighbourhood who 
    were not so vociferous). Alternatively, better road access to the present 
    site could be achieved, somehow bypassing the village and thus preventing 
    the traffic problems.</p>
  <p> The search for an alternative site 
    proved to be extremely difficult, primarily because of the area in which they 
    were based. Letchmore Heath is located in a part of Hertfordshire on the fringe 
    of north west London which has been stringently protected from the urban sprawl. 
    The designation of much of this area as 'Green Belt' means that building upon 
    it is only allowed in special cases, so that the rural quality of the area 
    may be preserved. Therefore, an alternative temple site is made problematic 
    by the need to either construct a purpose built temple, or otherwise to convert 
    an existing building. A further obstacle to finding a new site is that the 
    value of property within the Letchmore Heath area is very high.  The location 
    of this rural locality within easy commuting distance of London (the Manor 
    is a few minutes away from the M1 motorway) makes it an extremely popular 
    residential area for commuters, and it is therefore very expensive.</p>
  <p> ISKCON has a major financial asset 
    in the Manor, but finding another comparable building may prove to be impossible 
    for them. It is very likely, though, that even if the temple is relocated 
    to another site, Bhaktivedanta Manor itself will be kept by ISKCON because 
    of its association with the movement's founder Prabhupada. This conflict has 
    shown that ISKCON has been able to raise considerable sums of money (since 
    the legal costs alone have been around £500,000<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32"
title=""> [32] 
    </a>), but the expense of buying a new property at market value near 
    to the Manor appears to be too great for them.</p>
  <p> Fortuitously, in 1988 a piece of land 
    about two miles from the present Manor, in Dagger Lane, Elstree was offered 
    to ISKCON by London Regional Transport (LRT) for the nominal sum of £1 (on 
    the condition that planning permission be given by the council to LRT to build 
    on adjacent land, ISKCON pay all LRT's legal fees and that ISKCON covenant 
    an agreement that the land be used 'solely for religious purposes'<a
href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33] </a>). Although initially sympathetic towards this 
    new site, Hertsmere Council eventually decided to reject the proposal on the 
    grounds that the area lay within the Green Belt<a href="#_edn34"
name="_ednref34" title="">[34] </a>, saying that 'ultimately they wanted what was 
    best for their residents'.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35] </a>  ISKCON asked the Secretary of State to reconsider 
    this decision at the same time as his ruling on the enforcement notice, but 
    Chris Patten agreed with Hertsmere's judgement that 'the Elstree site was 
    not appropriate for a temple'.<a
href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36] </a>  This may have been due to considerable opposition 
    from residents living within the Elstree area, one of whom is quoted as saying 
    about Chris Patten's decision:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>We are over the moon. It was not a question of racism, it was 
                a question of sensibility.  We, the little people, have won our 
                case. (Leslie Winters, chairman of Bushey and Elstree Green Belt 
                Association, March 1990<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37] 
                </a>)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>With the collapse of this relatively low cost 
    possibility for an alternative temple site, and after strenuous efforts to 
    find alternative sites, ISKCON decided that there would be no purpose in them 
    moving from Bhaktivedanta Manor. Thus the youth magazine of ISKCON told its 
    readers in 1991 that:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>... it would be a sad illusion for (ISKCON's) members and friends 
                to believe that there was going to be an alternative venue. The 
                only real hope of continuity of public worship seems to rest on 
                access to the Manor &#8213; and the campaign to achieve that is 
                far from over.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38] 
                </a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Likewise Akhandadhi Dasa said in September 
    1991:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Our community has decided to stay put, we are happy here and 
                we believe that the idea supported by some politicians and half 
                the village residents for a new access road to the temple is the 
                right solution.<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39"
title=""> [39] </a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Both of these quotes point to the other alternative 
    practical solution to the dispute. The question of access has primarily revolved 
    around the feasibility of building a new road to the Manor which bypassed 
    Letchmore Heath. A major trunk road (the A41) passes within a mile of the 
    Manor, and in 1988 ISKCON suggested that they construct a driveway (at their 
    own expense) to connect the Manor to an existing lane which links with this 
    road. The main obstacle to this, however, was that the land on which this 
    access road would be built was not available &#8213; it was being used as 
    farmland, and one of its owners (St Bartholomew's Hospital in London) did 
    not want to sell it<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40"
title=""> [40] 
    </a>; thus the suggestion of a public inquiry to be held in 1989 to 
    discuss the possibility was dropped.<a href="#_edn41"
name="_ednref41" title="">[41] </a></p>
  <p> Negotiations over this issue have 
    continued for more than six years, with ISKCON generally considering Hertsmere 
    Council as obstructive to the potential of this solution<a href="#_edn42"
name="_ednref42" title="">[42] </a>. In 1993, however, the situation changed when 
    the landowners offered to make a deal with ISKCON. A planning application 
    was duly lodged with Hertsmere council, but was rejected at a meeting of the 
    Council on 19 October 1994 on various grounds. It was felt that the road would 
    encourage even greater use of the temple, and perhaps further development 
    of the site.<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43] </a></p>
  <p> The large scale use of the Manor over 
    the years has drawn attention to the fact that facilities to accommodate the 
    many worshippers have been fairly unsatisfactory. There is no room within 
    any of the buildings on the site for such large numbers and so temporary structures 
    have to be erected. For example, awning is placed in the courtyard outside 
    the temple room, under which worshippers queue up to file into the temple 
    to have <i>darshan</i><a href="#_edn44"
name="_ednref44" title="">[44] </a> of the temple deities. Once they have left this 
    room, however, there is very little indoor space for them, which means that 
    crowds of visitors have to remain outside when they queue up for and then 
    eat the <i>prasadam</i> food which is given to them. Even if the future of 
    public worship at the Manor is secured in some form, it is extremely unlikely 
    that planning permission would be granted by the Council for the construction 
    of any further buildings. In this sense, it would not be possible to improve 
    the limited facilities at the Manor, and therefore an alternative site may 
    become desirable to ISKCON if they could afford it.</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>The 
    Hindu political campaign</b></p>
  <p>The legal challenge and the search for a practical 
    solution has also been accompanied by a political campaign by ISKCON to gain 
    support for their case. This has primarily been based upon the issue of freedom 
    of religion, and the threat against a religious minority within a multicultural 
    society. Many local and national politicians have shown support for the Manor 
    over the past ten years &#8213; for example, in March 1992, during the General 
    Election campaign, there were visits to the Manor by prominent figures from 
    the major political parties, including Glenys Kinnock (the wife of the then 
    leader of the Labour party, Neil Kinnock).<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45] </a> More recently, Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East 
    (and the only Asian Labour MP in the 1992 Parliament) has taken up the cause 
    of Bhaktivedanta Manor.<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46] </a></p>
  <p> In this political struggle ISKCON 
    has presented the threatened closure of the Manor not only as an attack against 
    the Hare Krishna movement, but have also strongly emphasised the point that 
    the implementation of the council's decision would entail the closure of a 
    Hindu temple. For devotees of ISKCON, their beliefs and practices are only 
    'new' in the sense that they were first brought to Western countries in the 
    1960s. But, as mentioned earlier, Krishna worship through the line of guru 
    succession deriving from Caitanya dates back to the sixteenth century, and 
    is (for the devotee) part of the Vedic Hindu tradition which has existed for 
    millions of years.<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47] </a> As I have already noted, the majority of full 
    time devotees within the Bhaktivedanta Manor temple are ethnically white British<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48] </a>, and these devotees consider themselves to be 
    part of the generic 'Hindu' tradition, sharing a common spiritual homeland 
    with those Hindus who have a more tangible (i.e. ancestral) link with the 
    subcontinent. Indeed, many Indian Hindus in Britain are ready &#8213; to a 
    certain degree &#8213; to accept the legitimacy of these Hare Krishna devotees, 
    and it is this acceptance of the white converts that makes the temple so popular. 
    Therefore there is some strong justification for the ISKCON claim that the 
    closure of Bhaktivedanta Manor will be the closure of an important Hindu shrine 
    in Britain.<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49] </a></p>
  <p> This link between ISKCON and Indian 
    Hindus is strengthened by the institutional connections that exist between 
    ISKCON and Hindu organisations, particularly the National Council of Hindu 
    Temples (NCHT) and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The NCHT is an umbrella 
    organisation of temple groups across Britain (with a membership of approximately 
    ninety).  Bhaktivedanta Manor was one of the founding members of the NCHT 
    in the 1970s, and since that time there has been a close alliance of interests 
    when either organisation has perceived a threat to Hinduism in Britain. For 
    example, in 1983 the nightly television news programme 'Nationwide' showed 
    a negative story on the Hare Krishna movement, which drew strong complaints 
    not only from ISKCON themselves, but also from the NCHT.<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50] </a> It is not surprising that the NCHT have given 
    their full support to ISKCON over the issue of the Bhaktivedanta Manor temple. 
    The Secretary of the NCHT made the following statement in 1993:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>No other Hindu temple offers such facilities as Bhaktivedanta 
                Manor to practise our Sanatan Dharma. It is vital that the British 
                government recognise how important the Hare Krishna Mandir (temple) 
                is to the Hindu community throughout the United Kingdom, before 
                it is too late. The NCHT pledges to do all in its power to help 
                save the temple for all our community. We beg all Hindu organisations 
                to support the campaign now at this vital stage. (Vipin Aery, 
                Secretary of the NCHT)<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="">[51] 
                </a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Similarly the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) 
    and the 'World Hindu Council' (which is an international organisation seeking 
    to represent Hindus across the world), are also very supportive of ISKCON's 
    attempts to keep the temple open. In 1988 a VHP conference in Nepal passed 
    several resolutions to create an International Campaign Committee to save 
    Bhaktivedanta Manor, whose remit was to 'arouse awareness of this matter worldwide 
    and bring pressure to bear on each country's respective government to urge 
    the British government to intervene and save the temple at Bhaktivedanta Manor'.<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="">[52] </a> The Secretary of the UK branch of the VHP has 
    worked with ISKCON to raise awareness of the issue within this country.</p>
  <p> Although both the NCHT and the VHP 
    have rather limited political power within Hindu groups, they do have quite 
    considerable lobbying power within the political scene as national representatives 
    of Britain's Hindu population. This population, numbering approximately 500,000<a
href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title="">[53] </a> (approximately half of whom live in North and 
    West London<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="">[54] </a>), is a large and fairly prosperous constituency 
    whose views and feelings cannot be easily ignored by politicians. It was hoped 
    by both ISKCON and the NCHT that the government could be scared away from 
    a confrontation over the Manor issue. There are obvious parallels here with 
    the problems caused between the British establishment and Muslim groups in 
    1989 over the publication of the author Salman Rushdie's novel <i>The Satanic 
    Verses</i>.  But unlike the Rushdie case, the principle of freedom is being 
    invoked here by a religious minority &#8213; that is, ISKCON and Hindus in 
    general see their freedom to worship being curtailed by a heavy handed government.</p>
  <p> This very issue has indeed been tacitly 
    recognised by the local authority taking the action. As early as December 
    1988, the counsel for Hertsmere Council told a public inquiry that:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The fact it is of national importance; that three or four million 
                Hindus (sic.) do not have sufficient amenities; that many of them 
                live in north west London; and the fact that the Manor takes a 
                special place in their heart cannot possibly justify planning 
                permission being granted, and the consequent effect it will have 
                on the village.  (Elizabeth Appleby QC, counsel for Hertsmere 
                Borough Council,  December 1988<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55] 
                </a>)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>However, the combined lobbying power of 
    the NCHT, VHP, other Hindus and ISKCON have not been altogether successful, 
    since the issue has not been resolved. Indeed a source within ISKCON told 
    me that before the Department of the Environment made its judgement on Hertsmere's 
    enforcement notice in March 1990, there was considerable fear that the Hindu 
    population would react violently in the same way that some Muslims had done 
    over Rushdie only a few months before.  Therefore the government consulted 
    with a representative of British Hindus, asking whether a ruling against ISKCON 
    would lead to Hindus rioting on the streets in favour of their temple and 
    their religion. The response was an accurate prediction that the Hindus would 
    certainly be upset, but they would not riot.</p>
  <p> The international dimension of both 
    ISKCON and the VHP have also created some political pressure on the British 
    government in the international arena. A report in the <i>Sunday Telegraph<a href="#_edn56"
name="_ednref56" title=""> <b>[56]</b> 
    </a></i> suggested that a member of the Indian government had told 
    the British Prime Minister that the Bhaktivedanta Manor dispute could cause 
    disruption of the trading links between India and Britain.  Another report, 
    related to Eleanor Nesbitt by an ISKCON devotee in Coventry, said that demonstrations 
    by Hare Krishna members outside British embassies throughout the world had 
    made the Foreign Office exert pressure on other departments of the British 
    government to find some solution to the dispute.<a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57] </a></p>
  <p> Thus ISKCON have attempted to challenge the government 
    and the local authority by both a  media campaign and direct political lobbying. 
    Alongside this, ISKCON have also attempted to organise mass support for their 
    cause. The Hare Krishna Temple Defence Movement (HKTDM) was formed in 1990, 
    following the government's decision to uphold Hertsmere's decision. This movement 
    has sought to create support for the campaign, to raise funds for their efforts, 
    and to encourage people to make the pledge 'to continue the fight to defend 
    the temple until justice is obtained and all the devotees can visit the shrine 
    without further intimidation and persecution'.<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58] </a></p>
  <p> Those who join the HKTDM are encouraged 
    to manifest their support by writing to the Prime Minister John Major and 
    'demanding the right to worship at your temple', by 'offering a prayer every 
    day to Lord Krsna that He protect His temple so that His devotees can worship 
    Him without harassment', and thirdly by 'taking part in all the rallies and 
    events organised by the temple and the HKTDM'.<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title="">[59] </a></p>
  <p> One such rally took place through 
    Central London on Wednesday 16 March 1994, which was planned to coincide with 
    the end of the two year 'grace period' of the enforcement notice. This march 
    was attended by several thousand Hindus coming from many parts of Britain, 
    including both Indians and white converts (according to ISKCON the attendance 
    was 36,000, whilst a more conservative estimate by the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 
    was 'more than 20,000'<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title="">[60] </a>); following a bullock cart the demonstrators 
    carried plaques showing their support for the Manor.<a href="#_edn61"
name="_ednref61" title="">[61] </a> Leaflets were distributed in temples around London 
    advertising this march saying:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Because the Government supports persecution, they ignore our 
                needs and rights, they refuse to listen to reasoning. We must 
                NOW take action. We will show our outrage at this minority injustice. 
                We will show our defiance of the ban.<a
href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title="">[62] </a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The scale of support for this particular rally 
    was considered to be a great success for the campaign, and for British Hindus. 
    According to an ISKCON report the demonstrators 'were heralding the dawn of 
    a new era for this awakening (Hindu) community'.<a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title="">[63] </a></p>
  <p> There has also been a marked increase 
    of agitation among younger Hindus, who are making use of the Manor issue to 
    demonstrate their perception of being excluded from British cultural life.  
    This reaction against 'racism' is, in fact, focused not so much on the issue 
    of 'race' or cultural difference, but more specifically on their perception 
    of religious exclusion, that is as Hindus. Thus a youth branch of the HKTDM, 
    called 'Hindu Youths Saving Our Temple' (HYSOT), sent out the following challenge 
    to Hindu visitors to Bhaktivedanta Manor:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>If you have any self respect, any pride for your culture, your 
                heritage, your religion, then you would ... stand up and fight

            <p>HYSOT encourages Hindu youths to 'activate 
    your youth club &#8213; make them aware of the situation' and to contact other 
    youth groups (either temple or cultural) to 'let them know what's going on'.<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title="">[65] </a></p>
  <p> Another group appears to have developed 
    recently (in early 1994), which is called 'Pandava Sena, youth movement upholding 
    the rights of British Hindus'.  In February 1994, prior to the end of the 
    two year grace period, they began to agitate on the specific issue of the 
    Manor, distributing leaflets in colleges around London advertising a 'Peace 
    vigil against persecution of Hindu shrine' for 'young British Asians from 
    all over England', which was to be held outside Bhaktivedanta Manor. This 
    leaflet told Asians:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Your rights as a British Hindu have been denied. How long will 
                the Hindu Community sit back and tolerate the destruction of their 
                religion? If this can happen to the temple &#8213; it can also 
                happen to the Gurudwaras and Mosques. Time and time again Asians 
                have let others walk all over them. Now its time to stand up and 
                fight.  Support the cause of Pandava Sena and uphold your rights. 
                Help save Hare Krishna temple from closure!!!<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title="">[66] 
                </a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The rhetoric and some of the tactics of Pandava 
    Sena are not accepted by ISKCON leaders, who prefer a more cautious approach. 
    The movement's name is derived from a group of brothers in the Hindu religious 
    epic the <i>Mahabharata</i>, who go to war to defend justice and righteousness 
    and to regain a kingdom which had been wrongly taken from them by their cousins. 
    This name, and the rhetoric they use (such as the exhortation to stand up 
    and fight, rather than sitting back and tolerating their religion's destruction) 
    suggest a (non-violent) militant type of Hinduism. It is possible that they 
    may take some inspiration from organisations such as the Rastriya Swayamsevak 
    Sangh (RSS) who have themselves played an important role within revivalist 
    Hinduism in India (often in relation to other groups such as Muslims).</p>
  <p> However, this militant Hinduism is 
    combined with a pan-Asian approach, suggesting there is a threat not only 
    to Hindus, but to Sikhs and Muslims as well. What is interesting here is that 
    religious differences usually help to divide South Asians in Britain, rather 
    than act as a basis for co-operation (or even attempted co-operation). Although 
    there may be a measure of sympathy for the Bhaktivedanta Manor campaign among 
    some British Sikhs (a number of prominent Sikhs &#8213; particularly Namdharis 
    and Radhasoamis &#8213; joined a march in support of the temple in February 
    1994 in Wembley<a href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" title="">[67] </a>), it is extremely unlikely that much support 
    for the issue would be found among Muslims groups (who generally find Krsna 
    worship idolatrous).</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>The 
    situation in 1994</b></p>
  <p>As noted already, the legal decision made 
    against ISKCON ordered them to close the temple to public worship on 16 March 
    1994. During the months prior to this date visitors to the temple were warned 
    that closure was imminent. Announcements were made at events at the Manor 
    and messages put in newsletters saying that this would mean: No Darshan  No 
    Worship  No Festivals.<a href="#_edn68"
name="_ednref68" title="">[68] </a> Worshippers were 
    left in no doubt that the date would be significant and that every action 
    should be taken to prevent the closure occurring.</p>
  <p> However, on the day of the deadline 
    &#8213; after long consultations between ISKCON and Hertsmere &#8213; the 
    Council announced that they 'would not be prosecuting anyone worshipping at 
    the temple ... despite being legally entitled to'<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69"
title=""> [69] 
    </a>  whilst the prospect of the access road was being seriously considered. 
    They did, however, make the proviso that they may still take action if the 
    numbers attending the Manor 'significantly increased'<a href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title="">[70] </a> &#8213; but they did not specify what level of 
    increase would prompt them into further action.</p>
  <p> On 19 October the same year a full 
    Council meeting was held at which the access road and the implementation of 
    the enforcement were discussed. By the time of the meeting the leading groups 
    (Conservative and Liberal Democrats) had decided that the 'solution' of the 
    road would cause as many problems as it would resolve<a href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71"
title=""> [71] 
    </a>, and so as noted above planning permission was refused. But immediately 
    following this decision a last minute motion was proposed and agreed for ISKCON 
    to enter into negotiations with the managing director of the Council, and 
    then subsequently with local residents' groups, to find a compromise which 
    kept the Manor open without inconveniencing the villagers. Several members 
    on both sides of the council chamber used the rhetoric of peace in support 
    of this motion &#8213; comparing the situation with recent developments in 
    Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa. It was felt that if these insoluble 
    international problems could be resolved, then so could the Bhaktivedanta 
    Manor issue.</p>
  <p> However, in a private session of the 
    same meeting the Council went on to decide to prosecute ISKCON for failing 
    to comply with the enforcement notice. It was decided that the organisation 
    of the Janmasthami festival in August 1994 (mentioned at the beginning of 
    this article) had disregarded the legal judgement that the Manor should not 
    be a place of public worship.<a href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" title="">[72] </a> Court proceedings will be initiated, and ISKCON 
    stand to be fined up to £20,000 for holding a religious gathering which contravened 
    their planning determination.</p>
  <p> Despite Hertsmere's rejection of the 
    access road, there is still a possibility of it happening.  Before the October 
    meeting ISKCON launched an appeal with the Department of the Environment for 
    a public inquiry. This began in January 1995, and will take approximately 
    ten months to reach a decision, which ultimately will be made by the Secretary 
    of State for the Environment. The inquiry is hearing all representations on 
    the issue of the road &#8213; including Hertsmere's decision as expressed 
    at the October 1994 meeting. But at the governmental level it will be very 
    difficult to predict what decision it will reach. The intense national and 
    international pressure by Indians in support of the Manor may well influence 
    the Secretary of State to go against the local council's wishes.</p>
  <p> There does still remain the unlikely 
    possibility of some agreement being reached outside of these formal procedures. 
    For this to happen, however, there needs to be compromises made on both sides. 
    The council and residents will need to recognise ISKCON's (and British Hindus') 
    need to use the Manor for public worship. ISKCON feels that there is already 
    a precedent for this, since the Section 52 agreement signed between them and 
    Hertsmere in 1983 allowed use of the Manor on a large scale for six days in 
    the year, and for up to one thousand at other times. However, Hertsmere deny 
    that this was an acceptance of the place as a public shrine.<a href="#_edn73"
name="_ednref73" title="">[73] </a></p>
  <p> On the other hand, ISKCON will need 
    to somehow limit the numbers and / or use of the temple.  This could be achieved 
    by limiting the number of festivals (to between three and six days per year).  
    This would allow many Hindus to still use the temple, although not perhaps 
    as often as some would wish. ISKCON and Hindu leaders could also seek to limit 
    the number of visitors attending such festivals (and at other times), so that 
    the traffic jams and traffic pollution would be less severe.  Imposing such 
    limits would be difficult &#8213; as both the Secretary of State (in 1990) 
    and the High Court (in 1985) have both concluded.</p>
  <p> In concl.usion, there is a possibility 
    in the future for agreement and compromise if the various parties are prepared 
    to find a solution. But compromises reached in the past have not succeeded, 
    and so it requires a lot of optimism to believe that such negotiations will 
    be more successful.</p>
  <p> Another possibility for a solution 
    is if ISKCON decides to purchase an alternative site for their temple. As 
    I discussed above, this would leave Bhaktivedanta Manor as a theological college 
    and quiet 'spiritual centre', whilst large scale worship would occur in a 
    purpose built / converted building elsewhere. This could be sited either in 
    North London itself (and thus be closer to the majority of Hindus who currently 
    visit the Manor), or otherwise in an out-of-town area within easy access of 
    London, but with fewer planning constrictions. Hertsmere have made vague suggestions 
    about locating a temple in Milton Keynes (which would be inconvenient for 
    the majority of current worshippers at the Manor, and also away from Hertsmere's 
    concerns) or close the M25 motorway &#8213; but no practical site has been 
    identified since the Dagger Lane area fell through.</p>
  <p> It is probably the huge expense of 
    such a move that prevents ISKCON from pursuing this solution. But the legal 
    costs of keeping the Manor as it is have been very large, and to keep the 
    place open in future will require even further large costs (not only in legal 
    fees for the public inquiry and any subsequent legal action, but also for 
    the construction of the access road if it is allowed). There may come a point 
    when ISKCON decides that they could spend this money more effectively in creating 
    a religious centre elsewhere which is more suitable to their needs (for example, 
    with a large temple, hall and theatre). However, this would be extremely expensive, 
    and ISKCON in the UK may well find it difficult to find such money. The cost 
    of maintaining such a building may also rule out its practicality.  The money 
    for this could only be obtained through a major programme of fundraising among 
    Indian Hindus, which has not been possible in recent years because of financial 
    problems within this population following the recession and the collapse of 
    the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).</p>
  <p class="maintextsubhead"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p>This long and very costly conflict has been 
    (and remains to be) an interesting case study of a political campaign being 
    fought over a primarily religious issue, but which has also been complicated 
    by factors which go beyond the pure ideal of 'freedom of religion'. In fact, 
    it has been an important test case for minority and new religions in Britain, 
    demonstrating the very limited safeguards for 'freedom of religion' in British 
    law. The conflict has involved a number of quite diverse interest groups, 
    involving local residents' associations, councils, political parties and several 
    different religious and cultural organisations.</p>
  <p> What have come out in the argument 
    are not only the problems of intolerance against minority religions in Britain, 
    but also the role of local government, and the nature of a pluralist society 
    which is both multi-faith and multi-cultural. In some respects, there is not 
    only a clash of religious values occurring in the conflict, there is also 
    a strong clash of cultural values. After all, the legal paramouncy of 'planning 
    regulation' is merely an expression of a shared value that a 'rural English 
    village' should be conserved and enhanced, so that its historical character 
    is not lost. That is, the planning laws are placing the character of the village 
    over and above the significance of a religious centre &#8213; or more extremely, 
    the planning laws are 'protecting' the village from the intrusion of the religious 
    worshippers.</p>
  <p> Bhaktivedanta Manor is problematic 
    as a religious centre in two different ways. It is the centre of what is perceived 
    as a new religious movement, or more extremely as a (dangerous) 'cult'.<a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title="">[74] </a>  Furthermore it is the missionary centre of ISKCON's 
    activities in Britain, and as long as the Hare Krishnas are seen as threatening 
    to the British way of life it is likely that the Manor will not be popular 
    either.<a href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75"
title=""> [75] 
    </a>  But the Manor is also a place of worship for Indian Hindus &#8213; 
    people who are British citizens, but who are seen as different and 'alien' 
    because of their skin colour (and also their dress and language). As noted, 
    most of the parties who have opposed the Manor and supported Hertsmere Council 
    have denied that they have racist intentions, but there is a strong sense 
    of cultural exclusion by the Hindus who use the Manor. Regardless of whether 
    or not the Council have intended to be 'racist' in their actions, many British 
    Hindus are interpreting the conflict as a racist attack on their religious 
    rights as a minority ethnic group, and it is worth asking whether the conflict 
    would have taken so long to resolve if the temple had been a white Anglo-Saxon 
    Protestant church.<a
href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76" title="">[76] </a></p>
  <p> In conclusion, the conflict and the 
    issues that it has raised have paradoxically been of some benefit to ISKCON. 
    The financial costs have been extraordinarily high, but through a successfully 
    managed media campaign they have gained a lot of positive publicity from the 
    attempts to curtail their actions. The dispute has also helped to reinforce 
    and develop the ties that already existed between ISKCON and other Hindu groups 
    in Britain, and has strengthened a political alliance of British Hindu representative 
    groups. Because the campaign has shown Bhaktivedanta Manor as the one Hindu 
    temple in Britain that many Hindus are prepared to fight to save, the dispute 
    may well have helped to develop a sense that ISKCON themselves are now a very 
    significant voice of British Hinduism.</p>

              <p><a href="#_ednref72" name="_edn72" title=""> [72] </a>It is likely 
                that ISKCON will argue that they did not encourage visitors to 
                this festival  the worshippers came of their own volition and 
                they were merely let into the Manor so that they were not left 
                to paralyse the village outside the Manor gates.  Furthermore, 
                they will also point to the confused situation in Summer 1994, 
                since at that time the issue of worship and access were awaiting 
                decision by the Council. </p>

                (1985). Of course, not all 'cults' or new religions are dangerous, 
                but elements of the public and media may wish to see ISKCON as 
                though it was similar to the (mainly Christian) religious groups 
                as at Waco and Jonestown which have ended violently. </p>

                in Copenhagen, Denmark have faced rather similar problems with 
                their temple.  In this case the Hare Krishna temple was based 
                in a suburban house and faced opposition from neighbours who complained 
                about chanting 'in the back garden', use of a blue spotlight on 
                the sacred tulsi plant and the noise of a water fountain.  At 
                the root it appears that the complaints were motivated by neighbours 
                wishing to sell their houses and their concern about ISKCON's 
                effect on property prices (which some have argued is motivating 
                some of the campaigners against Bhaktivedanta Manor).  However, 
                in the Danish case, the temple authorities decided not to resist 
                and they sold the house and moved to a cheaper location outside 
                Copenhagen (and also later to small premises within the city centre).

                report following the public inquiry in 1988 concluded that the 
                situation would be similar if the Manor was Christian and not 
                Hindu (Agenda for Hertsmere Borough Council meeting, 19 October 
                1994, p. A36Z; Inspector's report para. 37.17).  However, this 
                is a debatable point which perhaps comparisons with other religious 
                institutions in the UK may well clarify. </p>
