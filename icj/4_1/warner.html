            <h1 class="maintextsubhead">Author: Marina Warner<br>
              Publisher: Vintage Books, New York<br>
              ISBN: 0-679-75924-7</h1>
            <p>What have the dinosaurs of<i> Jurassic Park</i> to do with Madonna? 
              Peter Pan with Frankenstein? <i>King Kong</i> with the <i>Epic of 
              Gilgamesh</i>? Grimms' fairy tales with the war in Bosnia? Cannibalism 
              with the Eucharist? Marina Warner's <i>Six Myths of Our Time</i> 
              demystifies the mystique of these old and new stories which tell 
              us the truth  while making it up  about ourselves and our world. 
              In the guise of fiction, often melded to history and fact, myths 
              embody meaning at a deep psychic level, seeming only to entertain 
              while actually shaping our identity. </p>
            <p> Originally delivered as a series of six radio addresses for the 
              BBC, Warner's <i>Six Myths</i> is a unique treatise on the role 
              of myth as a means of negotiating the life cycle. An author of stories 
              and novels, Warner has also written history and criticism. Her <i>Six 
              Myths</i> is interdisciplinary in its approach  the author admits 
              to the influence of the French school of classicists, anthropologists 
              and historians as well as of the Freudian interpretation of myth. 
              This is a rare review of archetypical, shaping myths as they have 
              been handed down from ancient times to the present. Myths are far 
              from having disappeared. Rather, as  Warner demonstrates, they have 
              taken on a new face and speak with a new voice. Myths are no more 
              static than history itself. Myths not only reflect the flux of changing 
              history, they also change history by 'secretly circulating ideology 
              through society'.'</p>
            <p> Myths inform social systems and contribute to a society's character 
              as much as laws and politics. Larger than the stories or events 
              which produced them, they are immensely influential in conveying 
              values and expectations: at their best they are ennobling, even 
              salvific. But they have equally negative potential: a capacity to 
              denigrate the individual, race or gender, locking us up in stock 
              reactions, bigotry and fear.</p>
            <p> It is this negativity which so alarms Warner. She holds before 
              us our universal beliefs, traces their origins and predicts their 
              consequences. This book is no tame, clinical survey. It is an impassioned 
              call for social change.</p>
            <p> But above all, <i>Six Myths of Our Time</i> is a deeply religious 
              book, for it is about re-integration and transformation. Warner 
              strips society of its pretensions and disguises, and asks: 'Do you 
              really like what you see? If not, are you willing to change?' That 
              change, she argues, must begin with our myths. They are doing the 
              damage and they are where the change must begin.</p>
            <p> Warner commences with the place it all begins: motherhood. For 
              femaleness is the gender of origin. However, Warner will not allow 
              us the comfort of maternal affection, as the title of the first 
              talk declares: 'Monstrous Mothers &#8211; Women Over the Top'. Warner 
              presents the terrifying velociraptors  the all-female dinosaur 
              population of <i>Jurassic Park</i>, who represent gynocracy  the 
              fearful spectre of womanly rule. With her powerful command of ancient 
              myth, Warner traces the confrontation between nature-coded female 
              and culture-coded male through Homer's female allegorical figures, 
              Madness and Folly (who take possession of men) to Medea (who perverts 
              motherhood and maternal love by infanticide). Craft and guile  
              woman's cunning nature for achieving ultimate sovereignty  make 
              her the perfect scapegoat. Medea reincarnates as velociraptor to 
              tell us, subtly but powerfully, that femininism is to blame for 
              all social ills. Women in general are out of control, and their 
              struggle for equality in matters of sex and sovereignty over their 
              bodies, is the cause of family breakdown, increase in divorce and 
              violence in children.</p>
            <p> The prescription is obvious: all she-monsters should be killed. 
              Slaying Medea and velociraptor are not just a victory for masculinity, 
              but for humanity! For after all, women are a godly mistake. Be they 
              created from the DNA found in a mosquito's blood or from Adam's 
              rib, by the priests of the temple of science or by God himself, 
              monstrous mothers are public enemy number one. Megastar Madonna, 
              gyrating her pelvis before millions, is the prophetic fulfillment 
              of Nancy Sinatra's theme song, 'These boots are made for walking, 
              and that's just what they'll do. One of these days these boots are 
              gonna walk all over you'. </p>
            <p> However, argues Warner, it needn't be this way. If these self-fulfilling 
              myths are rewritten, the true image of womanhood will emerge. Sovereignty 
              over herself, not over others, should be the theme of the future. 
              To prove her point she calls into evidence the praying mantis  
              that ultimate symbol of female monstrosity  which devours the male 
              alive after mating. Warner gives us the latest news: the female 
              mantis has recently been found not guilty by the scientific court 
              of appeal. Given enough to eat, that femme fatale falls pleasantly 
              to sleep. The lesson: monstrous mothers will be truly benign when 
              finally freed from misogynists' myths.</p>
            <p> It is precisely to this misogynist folklore which Warner next 
              turns our attention. 'Boys Will Be Boys' is as its subtitle informs 
              us, about 'The Making of the Male'. Again we are led through a fantasy 
              world of monsters  to begin with a video futurama of robotic heroes. 
              Our perceptive author-guide exposes the two-dimensional character 
              of such heroes as Robocop and Terminator: aggressive, but not self-reflective. 
              Unlike Dr.Frankenstein's monster who knew himself and was a reflection 
              of his maker, the nature of these robotic monsters of today is totally 
              unknown to themselves. Warner turns the spotlight on us: Are they 
              also a reflection of our own predicament? </p>
            <p> This warrior strength is nothing new; it dominates the literature 
              of ancient Greece. But the Greek heroes had multiple virtues unlike 
              the brutal, programmed-to-kill heroes of today. Survival of the 
              fittest may always have characterised the male identity, but it 
              was often accomplished by mental agility and intellectual force. 
              In recent times, Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen conquer physically 
              superior adversaries, proving cleverness a more attractive male 
              trait than mere physical strength.</p>
            <p> The Greek hero of antiquity had his tragic flaw which made him 
              an object of debate. Those heroes faced obstacles, both externally 
              and internally, which were the basis for moral argument and counter-argument. 
              Their weaknesses and mistakes provoked terror and pity, making them 
              counter models. But today's heroes of masculinity have no such apparent 
              flaws  even their heartless, emotionless constitution is considered 
              a virtue. The killer-rapist is today's hero, Warner submits. Advertisements, 
              video games and comic strips  all prime sources of myth  feature 
              static role models that show no inner growth.   Warner offers a 
              bleak prognosis: unless our myths change, we face the likelihood 
              of a world populated by Little Monsters, not Little Angels. For 
              as she explains, 'the culture that produces irresponsible fathers 
              openly extols a form of masculinity that is opposed to continuity, 
              care, negotiation and even cunning  qualities necessary to make 
              lasting attachments between men and children, men and women.'</p>
            <p> 'Little Angels, Little Monsters &#8211; Keeping Childhood Innocent' 
              is the subject of the third talk. It is a subject in which humanity 
              has a huge investment. For children represent a utopian state, a 
              hope that  Eden or Never Never Land is still possible. The Peter 
              Panish Michael Jackson (before his recent escapades) and his Neverland 
              ranch symbolised childish innocence. The apparent innocence of such 
              figures conveys purity and is linked to the inner self or soul. 
              They represent what we were and what we may once again become.</p>
            <p> But the myths are tumbling, transforming. Michael Jackson married 
              and is now divorced. The injured child of <i>Les Miserables</i> 
              has become the contemporary icon of humanity  the battered child, 
              the starving child, reaching out, appealing to our sense of loss 
              of innocence. This is the childhood of today; a fearful reminder 
              of what we have become.</p>
            <p> However, the transformation  of myth does not end with abuse and 
              impoverishment. Childrens' cartoons, a ripe breeding ground for 
              myth, emphasise violence. Psychoanalytic theories recommend that 
              children compensate for their hapless dependence by envisioning 
              themselves in a savage state in which they are allowed transgressive 
              behaviour never imagined by adults. The resulting myths, foreshadowed 
              in classics like <i>The Lord of the Flies</i>, have attained their 
              most brutal realisation in everyday news accounts. Dennis the Menace 
              was lovable, but some of his real-life look-alikes today are life-threatening.</p>
            <p> Certainly the children are not to blame for their lost innocence. 
              It is the adults who have given them centre stage; sexually encoded 
              them at a younger age; succumbed to their 'pester power' to make 
              them a consumer powerhouse. </p>
            <p> How shall we recover this lost innocence? We need to close the 
              gap between ourselves and them bring them closer into the family, 
              with all the members sharing together a common experience of life. 
              If we want little angels instead of little monsters, we should not 
              expect them to 'act as the living embodiments of adults' inner goodness, 
              however much adults may wish it. Without paying attention to adults 
              and their circumstances, children cannot begin to meet the hopes 
              and expectations of our torn dreams about what a child and childhood 
              should be.' </p>
            <p> 'Beautiful Beasts - The Call of the Wild',' is yet another exposé 
              on the search for innocence. Warner provides us with a most unusual 
              interpretation of the beastly nature: the wild man represents the 
              innocence of mankind, symbolised by oneness with nature. He is the 
              healing figure for today's ills. Nature is understood as uncontaminated 
              and contrasted to civilisation's progress. With God cast out of 
              the current worldview, humanity herself is next in line for sacrifice, 
              for she is replaceable by robots, those heartless, bloodless hulks 
              of perfection. Beastliness is a refuge from this humanoid nightmare. 
              Besides, beasts offer a standard by which human identity and exploits 
              can be measured and exalted. </p>
            <p> Tales of beasts such as Enkidu from the <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i> 
              have been around for five thousand years. In fact, wild men have 
              always had a prominent place in myth and legend. In recent times, 
              <i>King Kong</i> presented us a beast, who while clearly a monster, 
              is recognisably human in emotion. While we hope to tame these wild 
              men and make them like ourselves, we inwardly pray they may not 
              be conquered, lest their natural innocence be lost. There is a desirableness 
              in being beastly; in fact, these myths call into question the very 
              value of being a human at all. The failure of these 'wild men' to 
              conform to society's mores is not depicted as a triumph of civilisation, 
              but rather serves as a critique of its failings.</p>
            <p> Warner does not let us miss the point that in both cases  Enkidu 
              and Kong  'it was beauty who killed the beast'.' Whether the harlot 
              used as bait to ensnare Enkidu, or a lithe Fay Wray in the massive 
              Kong's grip, the female spells doom. Warner is quick to point out 
              that we are witnessing a reversal in the traditional role-playing: 
              now it is the female who is culture-coded, the male nature-coded. 
              But women are still a bad thing, here defeating the unrepressed 
              male sexuality and individuality. What kind of myths are these, 
              Warner asks finally, which transform man from his dominion over 
              the animals, to becoming one of them?</p>
            <p> And what act more aptly demonstrates human beastliness than cannibalism, 
              the subject of the fifth essay, 'Cannibal Tales &#8211; The Hunger 
              For Conquest'. From the Ogre in the fairytale <i>Jack the Giant-Killer</i> 
              who dines on the flesh of Englishmen, to Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, 
              where the damned eat their own and each other's flesh, cannibalism 
              is tied to fears of swallowing and being swallowed; hence, the loss 
              of personal identity. Often it was used to justify colonialism: 
              the cannibalistic natives must be conquered and civilised for their 
              own good. In such cases, the practice of cannibalism is used to 
              define the alien, though in reality it often mirrored the conquerors 
              as the essay's title implies.</p>
            <p> Cannibalism, however, is not always connected with barbarousness 
              or monstrousness. The Christian mass, for example, is a symbolic 
              celebration of consuming Christ's blood and body. Even ordinary 
              social intercourse betrays cannibalistic tendencies. Warner cites 
              lovers biting. Or, as she humorously notes, a mother squeezing her 
              child: 'Mmm, you're so good I'm going to eat you'. These images 
              of transgressive acts of intimacy, she informs us, are clearly cannibalistic 
              metaphors. Active social patterns combine with myth, 'defining the 
              forbidden, and the alluring, the sacred and the profane, conjuring 
              demons and heroes, saying who we are and what we want'.</p>
            <p> Perhaps no myth informs us more of our expectations than the one 
              that Warner saves for last: 'Home 'Our Famous Island Race' and 'Homelessness 
              &#8211; the predicament of our time'. Though her focus is upon England, 
              the implications are universal. For the myth of home is inextricably 
              tied to a national identity, and when the boundaries collapse &#8213; 
              due to political, economic, racial or other reasons &#8213; an existential 
              crisis ensues. For home is ultimately the story of personal identity 
              and belonging.</p>
            <p> For Odysseus, one of the first homeward-bound voyagers, home simply 
              meant native land &#8213; property and a place to govern. But times 
              have changed: one rents one's home, rests in a motel or wanders 
              homeless as a refugee.Whatever one's circumstance may be, the nostalgia 
              of home conjures memories of belonging. To the British it reminds 
              them of a supposed national insularity which, as Warner wryly notes, 
              is an historical absurdity. The 'Empire' belies the fact that England 
              was ever an 'island race'.' Yet the myth remains, reinforced by 
              politicians who mine it for its nationalist value. But when the 
              Empire has collapsed, the treasury drained and the home usurped 
              by the very peoples she once colonised, the myth becomes strained 
              and threadbare. Ethnic nationalism explodes as the colonised fight 
              the colonisers for that small island patch of land each now calls 
              home.</p>
            <p> At the core of the struggle is the way the story of place is told. 
              The colonisers (or those who claim to be their descendants) conveniently 
              forget the historical contingency of their total dependence on others; 
              while the colonised, dispossessed of their original homeland, now 
              consider themselves part of 'imaginary homelands' &#8213; countries 
              of the mind. Yet for all, as Warner rightly notes, 'home takes us 
              back to a golden afternoon in the past, and this brings in the question 
              of memory, which in turn raises history as an issue.' 'The politics 
              of nostalgia' often brings out hatred and monsters worse than any 
              myth could conjure.</p>
            <p> In the wake of the Bosnian bloodbath we cannot ignore Warner's 
              ultimate question: Can there be another way of talking about home 
              without harking back to nostalgic lies? We need a new mythology 
              of home. And this new way of thinking must be free of geographic 
              boundaries, for the truth is, there is no home today except in the 
              mind. The communication and transportation revolution is fast creating 
              a universal homeland. 'We are all wayfarers,' declares Warner. 'What 
              does it mean to belong and yet not to belong,' she asks, searching 
              for the answer which plagues us at the close of the millennium.</p>
            <p> How, then, does one find one's way home? Our author-guide gives 
              us a final hint: 'No home is an island; no home-grown culture can 
              thrive in permanent quarantine.' Good advice to us all, to be remembered 
              whenever circumstance or conviction leads us toward isolation. </p>
            <p> I shall take her advice to heart, for I subscribe to a belief 
              system whose traditions are rooted in the most ancient of narratives. 
              By narratives I do not mean to imply that they are lies, half-truths, 
              legends or any other form of fiction. Rather I am speaking of narrative 
              as the story of a culture, a religion, and hence of God and heroes. 
              Yet despite their ancientness and even their divine origin, the 
              narratives which have shaped my tradition's beliefs need to be examined, 
              and where necessary, their explanations updated.</p>
            <p> Take for example the myth of Monstrous Mothers, a myth which haunts 
              Marina Warner like an eerie ghost, appearing and disappearing throughout 
              her six talks. There is a feminist agenda to her book which she 
              makes no attempt to conceal. But being the Monstrous Author that 
              she is, even I, a member of a traditionally patriarchal institution, 
              find little in her views to protest. Rather, as one of her enlightened 
              readers, I offer the following in appreciation. </p>
            <p> Our Vedic tradition describes the ultimate Monstrous Mother &#8213; 
              Maya, the illusory material potency who keeps all conditioned souls 
              captive in the prison house of this material world. The ten-armed 
              Maya comes equipped with twenty of the most ghastly weapons which 
              she uses to behead male miscreants. She drinks their blood as it 
              spouts from their headless napes and tosses their severed heads 
              as play balls to her assistants.</p>
            <p> Because she is encoded female, those who share her gender are 
              considered to be her representatives. This places women at a dreadful 
              disadvantage, for which they have suffered through millennia. The 
              obvious solution is a reworking of the Maya persona. But how are 
              we to tamper with her identity or gender when her very personality 
              is intrinsic to our theology? It would be like trying to cast Hillary 
              Clinton as Republican male candidate for the Presidency. A more 
              acceptable proposal is to attach a fair and philosophical explanation 
              to the narrative.</p>
            <p> A proper understanding reveals that any unfair sexual bias implied 
              by the Maya narrative is due to a philosophical misunderstanding. 
              For the feminine gender is generic to all souls including those 
              who are masculine embodied. All souls are categorised as energy 
              (read female) and God as the supreme energetic (read male). When 
              this philosophy is properly understood, all souls irrespective of 
              their sexual bodily encoding will relate with each other harmoniously. 
              Boys Will (Not) Be Boys, but rather servants of God. They will respect 
              their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters also as servants of 
              God. This is the actual Vedic understanding and men need to be emphatically 
              reminded of it, lest they succumb to the very illusion for which 
              they are now imprisoned. </p>
            <p> By overcoming the bodily, sex-encoded identification, members 
              of either gender can gain release from material existence. Then 
              they shall meet Sri Radha, the feminine aspect of the Godhead, the 
              personification of motherhood and the antithesis of the monster. 
              She is protective, nurturing, the mother of devotion. And above 
              all, as the supreme energy, she is expert in pleasing the supreme 
              energetic. Radha and Krsna together are the Absolute Truth, the 
              Divine Couple welcoming all souls back home, back to Godhead.</p>
            <p> Which brings us to where Warner ended &#8213; Home. The Vedas 
              make no mistake by recommending a home within Maya's world of illusion. 
              Vedic philosophy describes the soul's constant transmigration from 
              one body to another, one home to another, as the progress of a prisoner 
              moving from cell to cell. Fighting for homeland is merely a symptom 
              of the 'skin disease' of bodily identification. Vedic gods and demons 
              battling for cosmic control or the petty or not-so-petty quarrels 
              of us mere mortals &#8213; all are but the behaviour of animalism. 
              Wisdom demands that we rise above our bodily identities, both corporeal 
              and national. Using the mind, and travelling through consciousness, 
              we should search not for an 'imaginary homeland' of nostalgic lies, 
              but rather for that eternal resting place of the soul.</p>
            <p> The dilemma of what it means to belong and not to belong is not 
              just a contemporary question. Rather it is a reflection of humankind's 
              primordial bewilderment. Though our present age may be characterised 
              by an ever-shifting population, the need for identifying one's place 
              within the world and the universe is as deeply felt today as it 
              was in bygone ages. In fact, our present homeless condition provides 
              us with a unique advantage: gone is the illusion that I can call 
              any place of this world 'home'. </p>
            <p> Humankind has been left at the door of the twenty-first century 
              like a newly born motherless babe. Like a premature infant torn 
              from the womb, we reach out blindly, searching for someone or something 
              we can recognise. But the myths that confront us, and offer to teach 
              us, will not serve us as favourably as their prototypes did our 
              forebears. Growth is painful and we fear what we may become. Cradled 
              in the arms of strange guardians, we feel insecure, confused, ill-nurtured. 
              The babe screams for its real parents.</p>
            <p> We are craving to know the meaning of life and the means to negotiate 
              its cycles. Marina Warner has done us a great service by unmasking 
              our custodians, those still potent shaping myths which determine 
              our identity. With her wry sense of humour and sophisticated wit 
              she may have succeeded in distracting their attention just long 
              enough to give us time to look for others; to successfully integrate 
              those which seem favourable; and exchange those which are not. How 
              we respond to the six archetypical myths she has identified <i> </i>may 
              well determine not only our own future but that of generations to 
              come.</p>
