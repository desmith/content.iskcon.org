              Klostermaier</a></p>
 <p>In this year of Srila Prabhupada's Cententary, 
    we are very pleased to present this analysis and appreciation of his mission 
    by Prof. Klostermaier, who met Prabhupada in Vrindavan in the days before 
    he came to the West. Having seen Prabhupada in the context of Vaisnava-Vrindavan 
    and the mission of the Caitanya movement, he is eminently well-qualified to 
    comment on the significance to the Vaisnava tradition that the message of 
    sankirtan, with all its emotional expression, has been brought to the West.  
    Prof. Klostermaier presents Prabhupada as a missionary who did not compromise 
    the tradition he came to represent, but who accepted spiritual leadership 
    in the face of 'materialism, consumerism and hedonism'. </p>
  <p>I cannot recall 
    the exact day in late 1962 when I met Swami Bhaktivedanta for the first time, 
    but I distinctly remember the place. Swami Bon Maharaj, the Rector of the 
    Institute of Oriental Philosophy in Vrindavan, called me to his office to 
    introduce his <i>gurubhai</i> and to tell him about my background and position 
    at the Institute. I was then around thirty and Swami Bhaktivedanta appeared 
    to me a venerable senior <i>sadhu</i> who was spending the eve of his life 
    in Krsna's Holy City, like so many others.  Since my own office was adjacent 
    to Swami Bon's, whenever he came to visit his <i>gurubhai</i>, Swami Bhaktivedanta 
    would stop by for a chat. He told me about his personal background and about 
    his project to translate the entire <i>Bhagavata Puranam</i> into English 
    in a multi-volume high-quality edition. The first volume was ready and I admired 
    the beautiful production, which by then was exceptional in Indian publishing. 
    He undertook many trips to Delhi to meet with his publishers and he invited 
    me several times to his modest quarters in Damodar Mandir. In my diary I noted 
    on 10 May 1964 that Swami Bhaktivedanta had shown me the second volume of 
    his <i>Bhagavatam</i> translation. We somehow came to talk about the Rama 
    Rajya Parisad, with which he seemed to sympathise. He told me that he wanted 
    to see God established as 'perfect dictator'.  He abhorred Communism because 
    of its atheistic ideology. I do not know whether he talked with Swami Bon 
    about his intended mission to America, and I cannot recall that he ever mentioned 
    it to me. When Swami Bon commented in my presence on the impossibility of 
    raising enough funds for the planned <i>Bhagavatam</i> edition, he certainly 
    spoke out of experience, since he had time and again attempted to elicit donations 
    from friends and well-wishers to keep his institute going.</p>
  <p> Swami 
    Bon Maharaj had himself been a missionary of Gaudiya Vaisnavism in India and 
    abroad.  He often reminisced about the exhibition he had organised in Madras 
    and the extended trips he had undertaken to England, Germany, the USA, Japan 
    and Burma to found centres and to preach the message of Caitanya. Swami Bon 
    was a powerful speaker and he had a good singing voice. Much of his biography 
    is contained in several contributions to a 1955 publication <i>Swami Bon Maharaj</i>, 
    edited by Shri Tamalkrishna Dasa at the occasion of Swami Bon's fifty-fifth 
    birthday.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1] </a> There is also a poetic autobiographical 
    booklet <i>The Search</i>.<a href="#_edn2"
name="_ednref2" title="">[2] </a> In another autobiographical 
    booklet entitled <i>The Founder of the Institute of Oriental Philosophy</i><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3] </a> he enumerates all the places 
    he visited and in which he gave lectures.</p>
  <p> While 
    Swami Bon Maharaj largely tried to imitate Western intellectual approaches 
    to religion, expecting in the process to convince Westerners of the superiority 
    of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, Swami Bhaktivedanta, probably without being overtly 
    conscious of it, remained firmly within practical Indian traditional religiosity 
    and thus helped to focus the contemporary Western search for emotional fulfilment. 
    To do this, he drew on the living resources of the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, 
    utilising emotions as instruments to reach personal fulfilment. For those 
    who were wildly experimenting with consciousness-changing drugs inducing short-lived 
    chemically-produced 'highs', he offered a systematic teaching on emotions 
    and a beautiful liturgy to reach a 'transcendental high', to 'stay high for 
    ever' and to become permanently 'God-conscious'.  </p>
  <p> A recent 
    issue of <i>TIME</i> magazine carried a feature article which suggested use 
    of an 'EQ' instead of an 'IQ' as the measure of a person's true worth. The 
    'E' stands for 'Emotion' (especially the control of emotions and emotional 
    maturity). Slowly the ancient wisdom is dawning (even in modern psychology) 
    that emotions, far from being irrelevant and marginal in a person's life, 
    are central and of utmost importance.  Emotions can no longer be dismissed 
    as 'vague', 'subjective', 'fleeting' states of mind without relevance for 
    the 'real world'. Western mainstream religions throughout the past few centuries 
    had tried to rationalise their traditions, to repress emotions and to conduct 
    services like business meetings. Swami Bhaktivedanta went against this whole 
    notion of a religion reduced to unemotional moralising and pragmatic fund-collecting 
    for good causes. He preached a religion that was not afraid of emotions. His 
    religion was full-blooded and demanded full engagement of the whole person. 
    </p>
  <p> Swami 
    Bhaktivedanta wanted to mould people according to his own ideal of a God-centred 
    life, and an astonishing number responded. While it emerged in the years to 
    come that full commitment did not mean the same for all, it did include for 
    all mind and body, thoughts and feelings, rituals and emotions. Krsna as the 
    <i>akhila rasamrta murti</i> demands a response from all human faculties and 
    that is what Gaudiya Vaisnavism is all about. While the importance of the 
    emotional dimension in religion had certainly to be argued in the context 
    of mainstream modern Western notions of religion, it has surprisingly also 
    recently become a major issue in India, as Krsna Caitanya's <i>The Betrayal 
    of Krsna</i> shows.</p>
            <p><b><Does Gaudiya Vaisnavism betray Krsna?></b>Krsna Caitanya's 
              provocative <i>The Betrayal of Krsna </i>raises many fundamental 
              issues with regard to Hinduism as a whole as well as to many of 
              its <i>sampradayas.</i><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4] 
              </a><i> </i> The larger concern &#8213; not to be taken up here 
              &#8213; is the assumption of an original, normative Krsna religion, 
              a 'fundamental' Hinduism, from which later developments strayed. 
              The more limited issue that will be addressed here is the characterisation 
              of Bengal Vaisnavism (Chapter XII) as one of the lamentable perversions 
              of an originally austere religion under the influence of eroticism 
              gone wild. He correctly points out that Bengal Vaisnava literature 
              is enthusiastic to the point of sounding orgiastic. He mentions 
              terms like <i>divonmada, premonada </i>and<i> preme pagal </i>which 
              designate states of 'madness' as seen from the standpoint of the 
              average law abiding citizen. He contrasts this state of mind with 
              his conviction that profound sobriety is needed for true religious 
              experience both for a deep musing on the design of existence and 
              for accepting imperatives for oneself in the light of that design 
              (449). He also complains about the 'noise, literally and metaphorically', 
              which that kind of religion creates, and refers to historic instances 
              of bans imposed on <i>nagara kirtans </i>by the civil authorities.</p>
  <p> What Krsna 
    Caitanya says is true of a great many people, but not of all. There are apparently 
    people who are extroverted, gregarious and noise-loving, in religion. However 
    much one might personally prefer to meditate and quietly reflect on the meaning 
    of life, one has to realise that the majority of our contemporaries have other 
    preferences. Should they be shut out from religion? India is famous for showing 
    a great tolerance for differences in religion, allowing a great variety of 
    religions to co-exist side by side.  </p>
  <p> From 
    the standpoint of a tradition like Gaudiya Vaisnavism, one could also question 
    the validity of the statement that 'profound sobriety' is the most suitable 
    mood for religion to develop in. Why not exuberance, enthusiasm, intoxication? 
    From the standpoint of the <i>divonmada</i> the 'deep musing on the design 
    of existence' may be a very inadequate response to the revelation of the divine 
    perceived as life, love and bliss. We obviously have a dilemma we cannot solve 
    to everybody's satisfaction. Historically, also in India, ecstatic praise 
    and festive abandon may have preceded quiet reflection and meditation as 'religion'. 
    It is a more likely source of community-bonding and foundation of organised 
    religious activity.</p>
  <p> No doubt 
    Krsna Caitanya is right to point out the ever present danger of debasing religion.  
    However, religion can be and has been debased in more than one way. While 
    emotions may have gone wrong many times in the context of religion, so has 
    reason: the meticulously planned elimination of dissenters, the deadening 
    formalisation of rituals and beliefs, the ice-cold logic of inquisitors, are 
    as much a violation of the true spirit of religion as debauchery and abandon 
    are. In short, no case can be made against Bengal Vaisnavism on the grounds 
    that its basis is aesthetics rather than rational metaphysics, and one would 
    have to judge it by standards other than those of a probably unduly rationalised 
    'original austere Krsna religion, as Krsna Caitanya seems to see it.</p>
  <p> While 
    disagreeing with Krsna Caitanya on some of the evaluations of developments 
    within the <i>bhakti</i> tradition, I nevertheless welcome his attitude of 
    honest self-criticism concerning Indian culture as a whole. 'We have,' he 
    says in one place, 'along with some of the loftiest perceptions of mankind, 
    some of the most misguided philosophising too in our tradition ... ' (p. 469)  
    I also agree with him when he says that 'we are lost if we do not recognise 
    that there is a lot of tripe in our tradition masquerading as lofty philosophy 
    and reject it outright.&quot; (p. 470).  </p>
  <p> Krsna 
    Caitanya emphasises the 'pathological excitability' of the founder of Gaudiya 
    Vaisnavism evidenced by his going into a trance at the sight of a peacock 
    and imagining himself in the presence of Krsna at the sound of a flute. Founders 
    of religions often carry features that are 'abnormal' and whose imitation 
    by a large number of followers would create the impression of mental disorder.  
    Nobody who accepts Buddha as ideal would try to imitate the years of extreme 
    penances that preceded his enlightenment. The average Christian would not 
    think it necessary to literally die on a cross in order to qualify as follower 
    of Jesus. And Muslims are not expected to either parallel the prophetic gift 
    of Mohammed or to imitate each of his actions in real life. Gaudiya Vaisnavas, 
    as we know, were able to found viable communities and to lead humanly fulfilling 
    lives. Their enthusiastic love for Krsna has made them accomplish much by 
    way of building temples, celebrating feasts and creating a rich literature 
    that bespeaks their emotionalism but is otherwise not reprehensible. The emotional, 
    enthusiastic, 'noisy' Krsna-<i>bhakti</i> that Prabhupada brought to the West 
    is not a betrayal of Krsna but a development of the ancient tradition which 
    is suitable for our time.</p>
            <p><b><The need to acknowledge the importance of emotions></b>Centuries 
              of rationalism that have shaped the modern West, have led to an 
              atrophy of emotions in the official representatives of our culture 
              on the one hand and a total debasement of popular culture on the 
              other, where emotions were allowed to deteriorate into animal instincts 
              unbridled by any human disciplines. Science, which dominated intellectual 
              life for the past several generations, eliminated on principle everything 
              that was not 'fact' and that did not follow the logic of its own 
              rationality. Erwin Schrodinger, a Nobel prize winning physicist, 
              once remarked that 'science is ghastly silent about all and sundry 
              that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It 
              cannot tell us about red and blue, bitter and sweet, beautiful and 
              ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends 
              to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are often 
              so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously.' </p>
  <p> Obviously, 
    if we continue considering red and blue, bitter and sweet, beautiful and ugly, 
    good and bad, God and eternity, important 'real' life issues, we need approaches 
    other than rationality and science.  Bengal Vaisnavism is one such approach 
    that seems to have worked for fairly large groups of people who were able 
    to realise God the Beautiful. Platonic tradition, too, recognises beauty as 
    an essential aspect of reality, on a level with truth and goodness. The only 
    way to perceive beauty is through feelings, not through rationality. Ideally, 
    the sense of beauty would be integrated into a perception of good and a vision 
    of truth. In reality the balance is usually imperfect and one of these areas 
    is more pronounced to the detriment of the others. Each age also has its typical 
    blind-spot. An overly rationalist age shows a deficiency in wisdom and sensibility. 
    An overemphasis on sentiment will result in an underemphasis on practical 
    reason and ethical consideration.</p>
  <p> The 
    'theologising' of the <i>rasas</i> is comparable to the 'humanising' of animal 
    drives: while humans eat, drink and mate, as animals do, in humans these functions 
    become 'humane', i.e. a means of expressing something higher than satisfaction 
    of physical needs (the symbolism of the 'Last Supper' or of the 'Symposium' 
    goes far beyond calorie-intake and metabolism). Similarly, while love, anger 
    and fear are universal 'secular' human emotions, in a religious convert they 
    are expressions of transcendent experience (the symbolism of intra-divine 
    love and of the 'dark night of the soul' again far transcends suggestions 
    of sexual union or dread of darkness).</p>
  <p> Caitanya 
    might not have succeeded in any other age than the one in which he actually 
    lived. The Hare Krishna Movement probably needed exactly the circumstances 
    which Swami Bhaktivedanta found in the New York of the early seventies to 
    develop. Earlier attempts somewhere else to win followers did not succeed. 
    Bengal Vaisnavism is a response to the needs of a particular time and place; 
    other times and other places may demand other responses. But the indisputable 
    fact is that emotions can not be suppressed for ever and eliminated in the 
    process of creating a human civilisation.</p>
  <p> The 
    suspicion towards emotions, as representing rationality gone wrong, is endemic 
    in mainstream Western culture. It is shared even by its declared rebels and 
    dissenters. Take Jean Paul Sartre, for example, who had this to say, 'It is 
    constitutive for an emotion that it ascribes something to an object, that 
    infinitely transcends the object. There really is a universe of feelings 
    ... We should speak of the 'universe of feelings in the same way as we speak 
    of the universe of dreams or the 'world of insanity.' </p>
  <p> Emotions 
    not only have a reality of their own, but also a logic of their own. It would 
    be self-contradictory to attempt to develop a rational theory of emotional 
    culture: experience alone will be the guide to an emotional systematics. The 
    Gosvamis of the Bengal Vaisnava tradition have provided it in their works, 
    especially Rupa Gosvami in his <i>Bhaktirasamrtasindhu</i> and <i>Ujjvalanilamadi</i>, 
    and Jiva Gosvami in his commentary <i>Locanarocanya</i>. These works come 
    from an 'insider', not only in the sense that he belonged to the Gaudiya Vaisnava 
    tradition, but also in the sense that emotions are looked at from inside rather 
    than 'objectively'. Active participation in, and identification with, the 
    emotions described characterises this approach.</p>
  <p> Recognising 
    the 'secular' scale of emotions established by Indian literary and artistic 
    tradition as reflecting 'real-life emotions', the Gosvamis, overpowered by 
    their own experience of ecstatic God-love, inject into it the essence of religiosity. 
    Humans have always identified the ultimate, be it of thought, of power, of 
    virtue, of reality with the divine &#8213; the ultimate experience of blissful 
    emotion is no different.  We have to trust the geniuses of emotion in their 
    own field as much as we trust the geniuses of science or the geniuses of literature 
    in their respective domains. Neither is interchangeable or collapsible into 
    something else. In either sphere we touch something irreducibly human.</p>
            <p><b><Are emotions antithetical to ethics?></b>One of the frequently 
              heard criticisms levelled at Gaudiya Vaisnavism is that it is lacking 
              an ethic and is also unable to provide a foundation for one. It 
              is correct to observe that the absence of rational systematics would 
              not allow for any kind of philosophical ethic nor would the deity 
              as conceived by them be the source of ethical commands along either 
              the <i>Dharmasastra</i> or the Biblical decalogue. However, the 
              sixty-four elements of worship contain an implicit canon of virtues 
              and vices identified with relation to <i>seva</i>, the central concern 
              of this religion. Thus the <i>Bhaktirasamrtasindhu </i>identifies 
              ten positive precepts for followers of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, paralleled 
              by ten prohibitions. Furthermore, it mentions thirty-two offences 
              against worship. While largely ritualistic, they nevertheless express 
              an 'ethic' and shape the behaviour of the devotee. Like other advanced 
              spiritual teachings it appears to presuppose basic ethics rather 
              than inculcate them and to concentrate on the development of higher 
              dimensions of spirituality. In their everyday lives, Bengal Vaisnavas 
              observe the same basic morality as everybody else and, if anything, 
              show a higher sensitivity in interpersonal relationships, due probably 
              to their intense devotional practice. Swami Bhaktivedanta began 
              his mission in New York by committing his disciples to a basic ethic: 
              not to take drugs, not to eat meat, not to indulge in illicit sex 
              and not to gamble. </p>
  <p> The 
    point most often highlighted by the opponents of Bengal Vaisnavism throughout 
    the ages is the exaltation of the <i>parakiya</i> relationship between Krsna 
    and Radha, the divine couple. While there is some difficulty in rationalising 
    that point in their faith, it should be understood that no teacher of that 
    school ever suggested that devotees should imitate this 'mystery' on the mundane 
    level. Practices like the ones that were publicised and condemned in the celebrated 
    Maharaja case, involving members of the Vallabha <i>sampradaya</i>, have been 
    perceived as unorthodox in every sense. Caitanya and his followers have always 
    insisted on the transcendent nature of Krsna <i>lila</i> (in a way parallel 
    to the transcendent nature of the inter-trinitarian Father-Son relationship 
    proposed by Christian theologians).</p>
  <p> It was 
    the Bengal Vaisnavism that Swami Bhaktivedanta brought to New York in 1966 
     and not the Advaita Vedanta which Swami Vivekananda had preached in 1893 
     that appealed to a generation of Americans sickened by a diet of drugs and 
    sex.<a

            <p><b><The importance of Srila Prabhupada's contribution></b>There 
              is a great need today for the specific contribution which Caitanya 
              and his followers made to the culture of their day and age, the 
              education of the senses and the emotions in an artistic as well 
              as a religious sense. Caitanya brought beauty and art to religion 
              and he directed the emotions beyond the merely material objects 
              of enjoyment. To a culture that identified religion uniquely with 
              renunciation, and which condemned all forms of enjoyment as entanglement 
              in <i>samsara</i>, Caitanya announced the message that God was Love, 
              God was Joy, God was Life. To a culture that identified happiness 
              unthinkingly with sense-gratification, self-indulgence and everything 
              that money can buy, Srila Prabhupada preached the transcendental 
              bliss of a God-conscious life. A world in which this God is present 
              in bodily form can not be all bad, all illusion or entrapment. For 
              Swami Bhaktivedanta it was more important to find God in the world 
              than to leave the world in order to find liberation. Instead of 
              writing off the senses merely as doors to hell and to hold sense-objects 
              responsible for all the misery of life, Caitanya (and thus Swami 
              Bhaktivedanta) saw them as doors to heaven and as instruments for 
              spiritual development.</p>
  <p> Everything 
    can be exaggerated, and every exaggeration perverts the meaning of an idea 
    or practice. Also emotionalism can be overdone and history has shown that 
    'love' can degenerate, and that depraved minds can read into religious mysteries 
    a meaning that offends all sense of propriety and decency. However, that is 
    the risk that is unavoidably present as soon as we deal with something humanly 
    meaningful. We need checks and controls, both from within and from without, 
    to make sure that an ideal stays an ideal. Indian literary theory has the 
    principle of <i>aucitya</i> ('appropriateness'), which demands that a statement 
    not only fit into the context of the specific work in which it appears but 
    also into the overall culture, and into general human concerns. This principle 
    has to be applied to religion too. Notwithstanding the unchanging nature of 
    the divine in itself, its expression in human terms and its appropriation 
    in a particular culture require an appropriate medium that is capable of conveying 
    the message to a particular audience.</p>
  <p> Gaudiya 
    Vaisnavism can be seen as an 'escape', no doubt. It arose at a time when the 
    condition of most Hindus in India was just about hopeless and when the majority 
    felt powerless to change anything. In such a situation Caitanya and his associates 
    'escaped' to God into a religion highly charged with feeling and emotion. 
    It had elements of the basic human instincts in it; it used erotic / sexual 
    imagery, movement and dance that lead to a frenzy, it was noisy and went public. 
    Compared to both the traditional <i>smarta</i> way of life and the more contemplative 
    forms of <i>bhakti</i> it was disruptive. Its success had to do with the frustrations 
    that people felt and that could not be dealt with by more 'proper' ways of 
    behaviour.  'Strong stuff' is required in such situations. Today's alienated 
    and disaffected youth could hardly be impressed by calls to duty and examples 
    of meekness as shown by mediaeval Christian saints. In contrast to the emotion-charged 
    pop-culture of today (in which a surprisingly strong religious element can 
    be found too), which quite often leads to acts of violence and vandalism and 
    in general is destructive and resentful, the emotion-charged movement initiated 
    by Caitanya lead to the creation of a new culture: a whole new town, Vrindavan, 
    owes its (re-)construction and its continued existence to it, with all its 
    artistic temples, images, its <i>rasa-lilas</i> and its pilgrimages, its poetry 
    and its music. In our own time the enthusiasm created by Srila Prabhupada 
    similarly led to the construction of beautiful temples in many countries of 
    the world, the establishing of new communities and a literary culture of its 
    own: the very opposite to the destructive trend so widespread in our present 
    Western culture. </p>
  <p> Gaudiya 
    Vaisnavism arose largely in reaction to the dry 'logic-chopping' of the <i>pandits</i> 
    that represented the 'official religion'. People have a heart and when they 
    remember God they want to worship rather than analyse theological language 
    in order to find personal growth and fulfilment. The emotive / affective part 
    of humans is more basic than the analytic / rational and hardly repressible. 
    Affects and emotions are, on the whole, a truer guide to right living than 
    mere rational analysis. They also create a more genuine bond both between 
    humans across cultural and linguistic boundaries, and between different species. 
    They provide a more real connection with the universe as a whole than other 
    human faculties.</p>
  <p> To point 
    to Western parallels may not be wholly out of place. Plato and the whole Platonic 
    tradition, which had such a pervasive influence on Western culture, strongly 
    emphasised not only 'Eros' as a moving force but placed the 'good' as the 
    highest being / value, accessible more through the 'heart' than the 'head'. 
    The Platonists and Neo-Platonists, including the Christian ones, taught a 
    'way of the heart' through which humans could see the ultimate. Augustine 
    coined the famous phrase <i>Ama et fac quod vis &#8213; </i>'Love and do what 
    you want, convinced that love would not go wrong'. While the word 'love' has 
    been, and continues to be, much misused for all kinds of things, there would 
    be few humans who could not discern the 'real thing' from the wrongly labelled 
    ones.<a href="#_edn6"
name="_ednref6" title="">[6] </a></p>
  <p> Beauty 
    plays a major role in Gaudiya Vaisnavism. Caitanya must have possessed an 
    artistic personality, one that was overwhelmed by a sense of beauty, and one 
    that responded to beauty in a total way. Also, Srila Prabhupada had a highly 
    developed sense of aesthetics. Although virtually penniless, he insisted on 
    making his <i>Bhagavatam</i> publication a thing of beauty. His devotees, 
    although personally committed to leading austere and simple lives, have created 
    palaces for God and do not hesitate to surround the deity with luxury. A person 
    can quite literally be obsessed by beauty, and a response to beauty perceived 
    or imagined has something elementary about it. It cannot be fully rationalised; 
    it cannot be fully controlled and it overrides all other considerations. Beauty 
    is its own justification; it does not require an intellectual or a moral reason 
    to exist. People who pursue beauty often appear somewhat odd to those who 
    are lacking that elementary sense: they do things, or behave in ways, that 
    would be considered irrational, even immoral, by the more sober-minded. Caitanya 
    and his close followers apparently belonged to this group of people. It is 
    hard to judge them from any 'ordinary' standard. They appeared crazy to some 
    of their contemporaries; they made noise, they disturbed the peace of ordinary 
    citizens, they used a language that offended the moral sensibilities of many. 
    They were quite literally <i>divyonmada</i>, crazy about God in a way that 
    went far beyond the normal <i>bhakti</i> tradition.</p>
  
            <p><b><Concluding remarks></b>The materialism, consumerism and hedonism 
              of many of our contemporaries is an incontrovertible fact and to 
              negatively contrast our age with that of a more restrained, disciplined, 
              austere character will not do much good. Austerity in itself is 
              not necessarily a virtue and poverty as such is not necessarily 
              desirable.  Nor is enjoyment of life a vice, or being happy a sign 
              of lacking religiosity. If, as theistic religions East and West 
              maintain, everything is either a creation or an emanation of the 
              Deity, then everything must have a divine dimension, and everything 
              must be able to serve as an instrument to reach God. This must be 
              especially true of central human realities and experiences, such 
              as feelings and emotions.</p>
  <p> The 
    tenderness with which Gaudiya Vaisnavas meet their God often translates into 
    great compassion and friendliness towards humans and animals. The focusing 
    of all the powers of heart and soul on the embodiment of love should make 
    them forget the petty quarrels and jealousies that normally fill the days 
    of people whose focus in life is their own dear self and its comforts. Caitanya's 
    symphony of feelings performed by religious artists like Srila Prabhupada 
    may, like Mozart's music, belong to a very different age, an age that is irretrievably 
    gone. But, like Mozart's music again, while inimitable and unique as far as 
    the origin and setting goes, it still is capable of stirring human hearts 
    and minds in our age and time. It may not solve any of our mundane problems, 
    but it transposes those able to perceive it, into a world of joy and meaning.</p>
