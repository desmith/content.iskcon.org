            Author: Nori J. Muster<br>
            ISBN: 0-252-02263-7</b> 
            <p><i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i> is a troubling book for several reasons. 
              First, because most of the decay and denial graphically described 
              in the description of ISKCON during the ten years after the passing 
              of Srila Prabhupada, are true. 
            <p>Secondly, because the author's attempt to illustrate the society's 
              discrepancies and, perhaps, validate her decision to distance herself 
              from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and her 
              former position with the society's newspaper - largely ignores ISKCON's 
              positive spiritual contribution in nurturing many lives and its 
              social contribution in many countries. 
            <p>It is a helpful book in understanding ISKCON's early years, but 
              standing alone offers a picture of the society that is neither balanced 
              nor complete. 
            <p>Muster weaves a colourful story of her decade of temple life within 
              ISKCON, beginning with her first meeting with the Hare Krishnas 
              as a college student at the University of California. She narrates 
              her early <i>ashram</i> years, her years of editorial work at the 
              society's newspaper (<i>ISKCON World Review</i>) and her gradual 
              disillusionment with the organisation. 
            <p>As a former member of the public relations department, she experienced 
              particular angst, and thus focuses much of her book on ISKCON's 
              unwillingness to publicly address critical issues that arose between 
              the years 1977-87, the first ten years after Srila Prabhupada's 
              'departure'. 
            <p>I empathise with the narration and dilemma that Muster vividly 
              describes. As Director of Communications for ISKCON in North American 
              since 1993, I am often beleaguered with the pressure of presenting 
              a healthy institution to its constituents, while providing objective 
              - and often harsh - internal critique to facilitate growth and reform. 
            <p>At a seminar I attended in 1994, the Director of Public Relations 
              from an Alabama Baptist seminary taught that institutions expect 
              their communications people to be 'a mouthpiece for the organisation: 
              to tell the good news.' But, he warned, a communicator's most important 
              job is to be a 'mirror for the organisation'. To communicate from 
              the outside in, how the larger society perceives, evaluates, appreciates 
              and faults that smaller community or institution. 
            <p>In that capacity, oddly, Muster continues to serve ISKCON. Her 
              (only slightly exaggerated) description of the eventual corruption 
              (of an uncomfortably large number) of early gurus, ISKCON's scepticism 
              toward non-devotee opinions and input, and the unwillingness to 
              demand accountability at all levels of leadership, tell a painful 
              story. 
            <p>In the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> Lord Krishna says that every endeavour 
              is covered by some degree of fault or, as the common adage goes, 
              to err is human. To some degree, then, we must forgive the mistakes 
              of the past and move onward. 
            <p>Real danger, however, lies with the close-mindedness and lack of 
              self-criticism that often accompany religious zeal. Documenting 
              ISKCON's failures, then - and its unfortunate willingness to overlook 
              them - is the book's strength. 
            <p>As Larry Shinn writes in his foreword to <i>Betrayal</i>: 
            <ul>
              <p>Muster's account shows that considerable personal and institutional 
                denial took place among Hare Krishnas who were in positions of 
                leadership and had the capacity to stop illegal economic activities 
                or corrupt religious practices that were unethical by the Hare 
                Krishnas' own standards. More leadership that is circumspect would 
                have saved the group a half decade of public denial and internal 
                conflict. (x) 
            </ul>
            <p><i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i> is an interesting read. Few ISKCON 
              devotees, friends or observers will not fail to find some previously 
              unknown detail of the movement's tumultuous ten years after the 
              departure of our founder-<i>acarya</i>. Human frailty, sin, chauvinism, 
              lust, greed and envy are historically proven elements for a successful 
              publication. Thus, they will find here a prominent place. 
            <p>This overemphasis on the negative, however, is also the book's 
              greatest weakness. Although Muster does not dwell on controversy, 
              an objective reader familiar with ISKCON will recognise that the 
              journalistic penchant for sensationalism and (perhaps) a need for 
              'personal healing' have overshadowed the more important demand for 
              balance and objectivity. 
            <p>As Shinn comments, 
            <ul>
              <p>Much as a disillusioned spouse looks back on his or her marriage 
                with both longing and regret, so, too, Nori Muster's story provides 
                a selective remembering of her experiences within ISKCON . . . 
                Therefore, many positive ISKCON news events are passed over for 
                their more negative counterparts. (x) 
            </ul>
            <p>Nonetheless, much can be learned from <i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i>, 
              especially by ISKCON leaders who should be vigilant not to repeat 
              the mistakes of the past, while zealously pursuing a brighter future. 
            <p>As a member of ISKCON since 1975, I, like Muster, am painfully 
              aware of the society's historical shortcomings, and its often spastic 
              endeavours for renewal. But despite that, the contributions of ISKCON 
              have far, far overshadowed its mistakes. 
            <p>Shinn writes, 
            <ul>
              <p>After Nori Muster left the movement [in 1987], reforms continued 
                not only in the United States but also in India and throughout 
                the world. It is not surprising that the Hare Krishnas who experienced 
                major institutional setbacks began to develop mature, spiritual 
                and institutional reforms in response to these crises . . . It 
                is important, therefore, to understand that Nori Muster writes 
                about ISKCON in the United States during the 1980s, not the Hare 
                Krishna movement throughout the world during the 1990s. (xiii) 
            </ul>
            <p>ISKCON does not choose to see itself as a 'marginal religious organisation' 
              as it is sometimes described. It wishes to be an important spiritual 
              movement, just as Srila Prabhupada envisioned his presentation of 
              <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> to be 'a cultural presentation for the 
              re-spiritualisation of the entire human society.' (Preface: xxi) 
            <p>To fulfil its vision and mission, ISKCON must continue to mature. 
              <i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i> records many of ISKCON's past shortcomings. 
              It is up to the current members and leaders of ISKCON to learn from 
              past mistakes and to rectify them. ISKCON's ability to develop the 
              ongoing process of maturation, through analysis and self-evaluation, 
              and to respond to criticism, will decide the success of the vision 
              and the mission.
