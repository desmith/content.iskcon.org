            <p align=left><a href="../contributors.html#Robbins"><b>Thomas Robbins 
              </b></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>A wonderful Jules Feiffer cartoon depicts a young boy 
              and girl growing up being told by parents, teachers, an army sergeant, 
              politicians and by the media what to think and who to hate. Finally, 
              the now elderly couple watches a TV documentary that exposes a new 
              and sinister menace: CULTS AND THE THREAT OF MIND CONTROL! 
            <p align=LEFT>The implication is that only indoctrination which aims 
              at inculcating something which threatens, or is contrary to the 
              institutionalised patterns and values of the culture is labelled 
              pernicious 'mind control.' Mind control that is built into the perpetuation 
              of a culture is not seen as problematic. A somewhat similar point 
              has been made by Thomas Dunn in his provocative paper, 'Religious 
              Mindopoly' (Dunn, 1983), in which he argues that in terms of producing 
              closed minds, the most effective mind control transpires when 'two 
              or more institutions collaborate for the purpose of instilling a 
              particular ideology . . . The family and the church routinely enter 
              into covenants designed to ensure the religious conversion of a 
              family member(s). As such, a 'religious mindopoly,' which uses the 
              family in the conversion process, is a vastly superior technique 
              to the most effective form of brainwashing.' But the family, even 
              if it is unfashionably authoritarian, is sacred; and the 'Christian 
              school' and evangelical summer camp is becoming less culturally 
              esoteric and thus appear to be controversial only in terms of occasional 
              policies of racial discrimination or excessive use of corporal punishment 
              (plus legal conflicts over certification). 
            <p align=LEFT>In short, evaluation of the means by which persons are 
              socialised is rarely independent of evaluation of the goals or aims 
              of a given program of conditioning, a point acknowledged by Schein 
              et al. (1961). Seemingly pro-social, or rather 'pro-cultural' conditioning 
              is generally accepted, even if rather stringent. Conditioning in 
              pursuit of esoteric or dissident values is more likely to raise 
              eyebrows. Moreover, inculcation of the values of a small 'cognitive 
              minority' with a highly sectarian orientation of 'go ye out and 
              be ye separate' more or less mandates intensive indoctrinational 
              and ideological supports which will be conspicuous and likely to 
              elicit a label of brainwashing. 
            <p align=LEFT>The cultural exclusivity of certain groups whose worldviews 
              devalue dominant institutions and cultural patterns constitutes, 
              in our view, a key issue underlying the controversies over 'destructive 
              cultism' and religious 'mind control.' 
            <p><b>Cults and Thought Reform<br>
              </b>'Washing a brain,' as Thomas Szasz (1976) has noted, is merely 
              a metaphor, akin to drawing blood with a 'cutting remark.' On the 
              other hand, there are surely significant models of 'thought reform' 
              (Lifton, 1961:85) and 'coercive persuasion' (Schein, 1961) which 
              have heuristic value in understanding socialisation patterns in 
              certain groups. Some of these models are relatively broad and highly 
              sophisticated, and are surely applicable to ISKCON and other contemporary 
              communal and relatively 'totalistic' movements or 'cults' (Richardson 
              et al., 1972; Lifton, 1985). In this sense it is not strictly incorrect 
              to say that ISKCON 'practices thought reform' or 'employs coercive 
              persuasion' (in terms of Lifton's and Schein's model) although such 
              a statement oversimplifies a complex situation. 
            <p align=LEFT>But what does this really mean? Neither Lifton or Schein's 
              sophisticated models imply that 'persuadees' necessarily lose their 
              free will although there may be special cases of subcategories of 
              coercive persuasion or thought reform in which ideological commitment 
              may be involuntary. Lifton (1961:3) specifically rejects the term 
              'brainwashing,' because it has misleading connotations of an omnipotent 
              psychotechnology that gains total control over passive slaves. Schein 
              (1961) notes that coercive persuasion is somewhat ubiquitous and 
              can be seen in numerous legitimate contexts including conventional 
              religious orders, college fraternities, social rehabilitation programmes 
              and the armed forces. Society thus tends to evaluate coercive persuasion 
              according to its objectives, that is, it's OK to mould a marine, 
              but it is sinister to shape a communist or a Moonie. Nevertheless, 
              basic patterns of thought reform and coercive persuasion are evident 
              in some socially valued institutions. Ebaugh (1977) identifies some 
              close parallels between social control processes in a respectable 
              cloistered religious order and Lifton's model of though reform. 
            <p align=LEFT>In our view, serious distortions arise when models of 
              thought and coercive persuasion are used as sticks to beat unpopular 
              social movements. The basic rhetorical device appears to involve 
              an equation of thought reform with 'brainwashing.' The latter is 
              implicitly equated with the lurid and sensational connotations from 
              which Lifton and Schein attempted to emancipate their models. In 
              contrast, Lofland and Skonovd (1980, 1983) have recently argued 
              that Lifton's 'thought reform' concept basically embodies 'ideological 
              totalism' (a term used frequently by Lifton), which is likely to 
              be a property of any communal, religious or ideological movement. 
              They distinguish this from true coercive conversion. The latter, 
              a rare phenomenon, should be defined, in Lofland and Skonovd's view, 
              by the criteria adumbrated by Albert Somit in the <i>International 
              Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences</i> (1968), which are substantially 
              more restrictive (and thus more difficult to apply to formally voluntary 
              movements) than the broader models of Lifton and Schein. Weightman 
              (1983:154-160) makes a similar point. 
            <p align=LEFT>Parenthetically, Lofland and Skonovd argue that the 
              controversial 'Moonies,' and possibly to a lesser extent the Krishnas, 
              have essentially resurrected the traditional 'revivalist' conversion 
              pattern of manipulated ecstative experiences in a group or crowd 
              context. This pattern has been central to American religious history, 
              but it has declined in significance since the early nineteenth century 
              although it is ubiquitous in conversion processes in many areas 
              of the world today. Since real revivalism has been, until very recently, 
              rather scarce in modern America, its reappearance is perceived with 
              alarm, and it is mistakenly assumed to be a totally new and horrifying 
              mind controlling monstrosity which turns individuals into robots. 
            <p align=LEFT>To conclude this section: while relatively broad models 
              of thought reform and coercive persuasion would clearly fit the 
              Hare Krishna movement, this is simply not tantamount to saying that 
              devotees are 'brainwashed' in the sense that they lose free will 
              and that their ideological and organisational involvement is largely 
              passive, unmotivated, and involuntary. The stigma of 'brainwashing' 
              in this sensational 'robotist' sense of the term tends to be applied 
              when the goals as well as the means of socialisation are disvalued 
              and the whole thrust of group values is perceived as antisocial 
              and antithetical to cultural norms. 
            <p><b>Socialising Krishna Children<br>
              </b>An important paper by Lilliston (1987) indicates that the more 
              collectivistic and goal- directed pattern of child rearing and education 
              within the Krishna community does indeed depart from the more individualistic 
              and 'permissive' model that is currently normatively dominant in 
              the United States. On the other hand, Lilliston's data appear to 
              show that negative consequences for the children in terms of creativity, 
              independence, pathological symptomatology, and coping capacity do 
              not appear to ensue (see also Ross, 1983a; 1983b). 
            <p align=LEFT>On the other hand, the Lilliston paper, as well as papers 
              by Gordon (in press) and Bromley (in press), which attempt to evaluate 
              and analyse the allegations against Hare Krishna in the realm of 
              mental health, indicate that in this area the 'anticult' critics 
              have set the agenda of discourse. Lilliston, Gordon, and Bromley 
              are all concerned to refute the allegations against 'cults' put 
              forward by various activist clinicians; nevertheless, their efforts 
              seem to reinforce the tendency whereby the relevant psychiatric, 
              mental health, and child rearing issues bearing upon the Hare Krishna 
              movement are defined by the vehement opponents of the movement. 
            <p align=LEFT>There are other interesting issues, however, which do 
              not get ventilated, because they have not become entangled in cult/anticult 
              polemics. One such possible issue entails the doctrine that the 
              physical body does not pertain to the essence of being. At the Gurukula 
              schools (run by Hare Krishna) children who become concerned with 
              minor pains are told that they are experiencing an illusory identification 
              with their physical body; that is, once one realises that one is 
              not 'really' one's physical body, bodily afflictions will be experienced 
              as less traumatic and pain (or hunger or sexual urge) will seem 
              less imperative. The thrust of this theodicy seems to manifest a 
              striking estrangement from the increasing 'holistic' emphasis of 
              contemporary culture. The current media stress on physical conditioning 
              and the interrelationship of strength, beauty, personality, and 
              happiness seems to imply that one's body is integral to one's inner 
              being and that the state of one's body reflects one's essential 
              self. The radical soul/ body dualism of Hare Krishna appears to 
              hark back to earlier American traditions (for example, Puritanism) 
              in contrast to more recent 'narcissistic' currents. 
            <p align=LEFT>The Gurukula children are brought up reading largely 
              stories from Hindu mythology and scripture. By and large, they are 
              not introduced to much of the material through which the reading 
              skills of most American children are developed, for example, Mark 
              Twain, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, 'Judy's Visit to the Zoo' and 
              so on. 
            <p align=LEFT>This system runs contrary to the views of those who 
              like American Federation of Teachers president Albert Shanker (1985), 
              believe that 'literacy requires learning the culture' and 'kids 
              must know Jack Sprat and Emerson.' Shanker cites the paper, 'Cultural 
              Literacy and the School' by E. D. Hirsch, Jr. (Hirsch, 1985) which 
              argues that to be acculturated, functionally literate Americans, 
              children must develop some familiarity with Adam and Eve, Noah and 
              the flood, David and Goliath, Humpty Dumpty, Cinderella, Pinocchio, 
              Peter Pan, and other elements of our 'literary and mythic heritage,' 
              as well as Davy Crockett, Yankee Doodle, Emily Dickinson, Lord Cornwallis, 
              and so forth. For various reasons, according to Hirsch and Shanker, 
              contemporary school curricula are deficient in terms of inculcating 
              the rudiments of cultural unity and tradition. 'It's a mistake to 
              think that kids cannot be as excited by Daniel Boone or Davy Crockett 
              or John Brown as much by Bruce Springsteen or Dwight Gooden' (Shanker, 
              1985). 
            <p align=LEFT>The Hare Krishnas actually share with Shanker and Hirsch 
              a firm rejection of the view that reading is essentially a technical 
              skill such that it does not matter what content or subject matter 
              is employed to develop reading powers-it is the skill that counts. 
              Nevertheless, the Hindu exclusivity of Gurukula reading programs 
              reflects the underlying alienation of the Krishnas from the conventional 
              American culture-Davy Crockett and Bruce Springsteen. This alienation 
              is also manifested in the visions, as expressed to the writer, by 
              some devotees at the emerging New Vrindaban settlement in W. Virginia, 
              that that community will develop as a refuge and a fortress when 
              America's 'dying culture' collapses and chaos and violence pervade 
              the land. (This view is not normative for all of ISKCON; indeed 
              Swami Bhaktipada of New Vrindaban has just been expelled from the 
              movement.) 
            <p align=LEFT>The Krishnas and the 'Moonies,' so different in many 
              respects, nevertheless, appear to converge with regard to a self-definition 
              as the exclusive beacon of spirituality in a world pervaded by demonic 
              forces. 'Today the world is controlled by demons totally devoid 
              of Krishna consciousness,' notes Swami Bhaktipada. 'In such an atmosphere, 
              there can be neither peace nor happiness. Until the Lord's devotees 
              spread Krishna consciousness throughout the world, there will be 
              no peace' (Bhaktipada, 1984:183). 
            <p align=LEFT>It is our view that this attitude, which is resented 
              by many Americans, whose lives and accomplishments are radically 
              devalued, underlies much of the hostility to 'totalistic' and 'intolerant' 
              religious 'cults.' The latter naturally appear as threats to basic 
              values and institutions. As one relatively moderate theorist of 
              the 'anticult movement'has written, intolerant cults provoke a 'valid 
              cultural protest' on the part of citizens, which unfortunately sometimes 
              leads to regrettable persecutory excesses (Langone, 1985). While 
              avoiding extreme persecution, the law, it has been suggested, might 
              explore ways to 'incline toward defence of the culture.' 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Krishna and Culture<br>
              </b>This attitude of radical estrangement form the dominant cultural 
              milieu is hardly foreign to the history of Christianity. The classic 
              expression of this outlook was by Tertullian, who asked, 'What has 
              Jerusalem to do with Athens?' (That is what has our truth in Christ 
              to do with the doomed and degraded dominant (pagan-Hellenistic) 
              culture?) Like many Christians of the first and second century, 
              Tertullian believed that 'whatever does not belong to the commonwealth 
              of Christ is under the rule of evil . . . so that the plain alternative 
              was to be either a Christian or a wicked man' (Neibuhr, 1951:50). 
              Sin, according to Tertullian, resides chiefly in culture. Christ 
              comes not to civilise 'boors and savages' but 'to enlighten men 
              already civilised, and <i>under illusions from their very culture, 
              that they might come to the knowledge of truth</i>' (quoted in Neibuhr, 
              1951:53, my emphasis). Thus, Tertullian 'has no sympathy with the 
              efforts of some Christians of his time to point out positive connections 
              between their faith and the ideas of the Greek philosophers. &quot;Away,&quot; 
              he exclaims, &quot;with all attempts to produce a mottled Christianity 
              of stoic, platonic and dialectic composition . . . with our faith 
              we desire no further belief'&quot; ' (Neibuhr, 1951:54). 
            <p align=LEFT>But his attitude has not remained dominant in Christianity. 
              More popular in the twentieth century has been the attitude embodied 
              in Bruce Barton's best-seller, <i>The Man Nobody Knows</i>, which 
              argued that Christ was an amazingly proficient businessman and corporate 
              executive. Christ as anti-cultural demiurge has become Christ as 
              culture hero. In this view, accepted to some extent by Locke, Leibniz, 
              Kant, Jefferson, and even Christian radicals, Christ works through 
              culture and within the human community rather than on it from without. 
              The 'Christ of Culture' 'does not call upon men to leave homes and 
              kindred for his sake; he enters into their homes and all their associations 
              as the gracious presence which adds an aura of infinite meaning 
              to all temporal tasks' (Neibuhr, 1951:93). 
            <p align=LEFT>The Hare Krishnas presently incline toward the 'anti-cultural' 
              polarity. However, this may change. If Krishna can drive a chariot, 
              perhaps he can also drive a truck and sing country music. Nevertheless, 
              the self-concept of the movement as the exclusive beacon of spirituality 
              in a degraded and demonic world presently renders the movement somewhat 
              of an 'uncivil religion' in the sense that there is a violation 
              of the American 'Religion of Civility' (Cuddihy, 1978)-its fetish 
              of tolerance, its sacralisation of religious pluralism, and its 
              fervent, apocalyptic hostility to fervent and apocalyptic messianic 
              religion (Robbins, 1985). 
            <p align=LEFT>American culture might thus be said to be 'intolerant 
              of intolerance.' In this regard, it resembles imperial Roman culture, 
              which encompassed a great diversity of customs and faiths such that 
              unity could only be sustained if reverence and respect were granted 
              to the multifold traditions and rites of constituent elements. Romans 
              could thus be expected, notes Gibbon, to 'unite with indignation 
              against any sect of people that should separate itself from the 
              communion of mankind and disdain every form of worship except its 
              own as impious and idolatrous.' (Gibbon, 1969: 402) 
            <p align=LEFT>Over time, American faiths have tended to surrender 
              their elements of intolerance and exclusivity. This, as John Cuddihy 
              (1978: 26) notes, is what happened to the major American religious 
              communities: 
            <ul>
              <p>In the American setting, and under the steady gaze of the American 
                'public philosophy' and its civil religion, these traditional 
                monopolistic pretensions made their own adherents uneasy and embarrassed. 
                The Roman Catholic claim to uniqueness (the 'One True Church'); 
                the Jewish claim to uniqueness ('the chosen people'); the Protestant 
                fundamentalist claim to uniqueness ('Jesus only saves')-are variants 
                of a more general claim: the claim to be religiously superior 
                or elite. While the traditionalist spokesmen for these religions 
                . . .[may still ritualistically put forward old totalitarian claims] 
                . . . few members of their own religions take these claims very 
                seriously, and, of course, even fewer members of the other religions. 
                <br>
                The 'established' situation of pluralism in America makes these 
                traditional definitions of religious reality sound silly as their 
                large claims echo across the American heartland; the pervasive 
                civil religion of America makes them sound heretical. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The pressure of the dominant 'religion of civility,' 
              which celebrates, indeed sacralises, 'established' denominational 
              pluralism, pushes religionists toward the assumption of a humble 
              one-among-many men. The prophet Elijah becomes Uriah Heep. Thus, 
              apocalyptic visions and claims to an exclusive truth tend to be 
              gradually mitigated, as Cuddihy has demonstrated, until 'no offence' 
              is given. 
            <p align=LEFT>As Gordon (in press) notes, there are certainly signs 
              of incipient cultural accommodation and mitigation of exclusivity 
              in ISKCON. But if the intolerance is exorcised from the symbolic 
              universe of Hare Krishna, what will be left of the latter? Tolerance, 
              notes G. K. Chesterton, is the virtue of those who believe in nothing. 
              The contribution of ISKCON lies partly in its claim to uniqueness. 
              Without these claims and with too humble an acknowledgement that 
              there are other ways and other truths, Hare Krishna would not be 
              Hare Krishna. 
            <p><b><i>Postscript<br>
              </i></b>Ultimately, the process of assimilating Hare Krishna is 
              a two-sided or relational one: the perception of Krishna civility 
              by the society qua 'audience' is a vital component of the process. 
              In the 1970s, 'ISKCON was viewed by many people in America as a 
              threatening movement which sought to exploit the public for financial 
              gain' (Rochford, 1985:269). In his recent monograph, Hare Krishna 
              in America, E. Burke Rochford (1985:275) writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>More than any other single factor, the continuation of the current 
                public attitude toward the Krishna movement in America threatens 
                to severely limit its efforts to gain legitimacy, and this would 
                hinder its prospects form becoming a denomination. . . . Without 
                gaining some degree of public acceptance, ISKCON cannot hope to 
                reach the status even of a tolerated adjunct to other religious 
                institutions in America. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In the 1980s revelations and allegations involving violence 
              arising in factional struggles within ISKCON and drug profits funnelled 
              into the operations of certain regional projects (Huber and Gruson, 
              1987) have impeded the process of cultural assimilation and legitimation 
              of ISKCON. It is perhaps unfortunate that these allegations have 
              arisen while the litigation connected with 'brainwashing' conversions 
              appears to be reaching a crucial stage. The Los Angeles Krishnas 
              are appealing a $9.5 million civil award for having falsely imprisoned 
              (via brainwashing) a minor and inflicting emotional distress on 
              her parents. In the trial much was made of Hare Krishna intolerance 
              and its alleged use of eschatological threats (For example, apostates 
              may be reincarnated as worms); moreover, there was dubious clinical 
              testimony that the basic ritual chanting of Hare Krishna produced 
              a pathological disassociative trance state. The outlook for the 
              'normalisation' or civility-assimilation of the movement does not 
              now seem terribly bright. 
            <p align=LEFT>Ironically, were it not for current scandals and legal 
              crises, the outlook for cultural assimilation would look rather 
              favourable. The dilemma of sectarian assimilation--that mitigation 
              of doctrinal rigidity and intolerance will alter the fundamental 
              nature and spiritual integrity of the movement-does not seem insuperable 
              in the light of the current extension of American religious pluralism. 
              Televangelists such as Jimmy Swaggert continually proclaim intolerant 
              formulations in which not only non-Christian faiths but also many 
              churches are accused of implicitly serving Satan. Although religious 
              conflict is now growing in the United States, Americans will probably 
              be compelled to accustom themselves to intolerant sectarian faiths 
              in their midst challenging the liberal consensus. The adaptations 
              in the direction of moderation which zealous sects must make (see 
              Rochford, 1985:269-75 on Hare Krishna efforts to develop a positive 
              public image) are thus less substantial than might otherwise be 
              the case. 
            <p align=LEFT>Unfortunately the present legal problems of the movement 
              and the tangible transgressions (for example, violence, sale of 
              contraband) which may have intensified these problems cannot be 
              automatically assumed to be merely fortuitous consequences of the 
              personalities of certain regional leaders. The scholarly observer 
              must inquire whether the interesting mixture of relativism and absolutism 
              in the ISKCON worldview has contributed to the current crisis by 
              implying that any means to spread the word (for example, 'stealing 
              for Krishna'-see Rochford, 1985:198-99) is legitimate and that, 
              moreover, conventional moral rules are illusory emanations of maya. 
              The primacy of charismatic authority in the Krishna symbolic universe 
              has also contributed to volatility and factionalism (Rochford, 1985:221-254) 
              and has permitted the dangerous eccentricities of youthful regional 
              leaders to flourish in the post-Prabhupada period. It is possible 
              that the elements of intolerance, practical absolutism, cosmic relativism, 
              and need for charismatic authority which are combined in ISKCON 
              render the movement's stable institutionalisation and evolution 
              of a modus vivendi with the broader society very difficult, at least 
              in the absence of a strong but moderate single leader.
