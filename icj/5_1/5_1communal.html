            <p><b>Introduction - Objectives, orientation, rationale <br>

              </b>One basic, but, I think, as yet unanswered, question that hovers 

              over the current upsurge of Hindu fundamentalism and communal politics 

              in India is: do traditional forms of Hindu religion on the whole 

              reinforce this upsurge or tend to resist or retard it; or, perhaps, 

              do they have no perceptible impact at all?

            <p>Alternatively, and more precisely, one may ask, do the diverse 

              types and denominations (<i>sampradayas</i>) of traditional Hindu 

              religion relate to the Hindu communal upsurge in much the same way, 

              or in differential fashion? And, if differentially, how so? These 

              are not purely academic questions, especially for those who may 

              be anxious over the waxing of communal Hindu religio-political nationalism, 

              but uncertain where to look for effective alternatives. 

            <p>I do not want to get into here the semantic and conceptual problems 
              of defining Hindu and Hinduism, which could take us far afield.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#1">1</a> 
              This paper focuses, not on Hinduism or Hindutva (the ideologically 
              driven notion of religio-socio-political &quot;Hinduness&quot;). 
              Rather, it examines the religious self-understanding and socio-political 
              orientation of one devotional (<i>bhakti</i>) movement or denomination 
              (<i>sampradaya</i>) within the far wider Hindu religio-cultural 
              and social world, the Chaitanya Vaishnavas (also known as Gaudiya 
              Vaishnavas). Analogous studies might well be done for other <i>bhakti</i> 
              movements, as well as for other sampradayas shaping traditional 
              Hindu religious life. Interestingly, the religious self-understanding 
              of Chaitanya Vaishnavas traditionally has tended not to emphasise 
              the category Hindu, though most devotees, if asked, would consider 
              themselves in some sense Hindu. 
            <p>&nbsp;The sketches drawn in this essay of Chaitanya Vaishnava <i>bhakti</i> 

              and of the traditional devotees' typical orientation to socio-political 

              affairs are matters on which I feel reasonably confident. However, 

              I am less confident in estimating how strongly that traditional 

              pattern of Chaitanya <i>bhakti</i> and socio-political orientation 

              is maintaining itself in contemporary India and abroad. I am even 

              less confident in predicting how Chaitanya Vaishnavas will, in the 

              face of continuing controversy, resolve the tensions between fidelity 

              to their distinctive kind of devotion to Krishna and the demands 

              of Hindu fundamentalism and communal politics. Hence, this essay 

              is exploratory rather than conclusive.

            <p>In this essay I provide a schematic sketch of Chaitanya Vaishnava 

              devotion (<i>bhakti</i>) and its basic relationship to socio-political 

              affairs. I also consider how this kind of religious commitment, 

              especially if intensified through systematic religious discipline 

              (<i>sadhana</i>), might be expected in theory to reinforce, resist 

              or ignore Hindu fundamentalism and communalism. I then offer my 

              own anecdotal observations and those of another scholar, Klaus Klostermaier, 

              on how in practice Chaitanya Vaishnavas appear to be reacting to 

              recent communal Hindu religio-political initiatives. Finally, I 

              suggest some directions in which further inquiry on these points 

              might go.

            <p>Even if the typical response of Chaitanya Vaishnavas to Hindu fundamentalism 

              and communalism can be determined, this need not at all imply that 

              bhakti movements generally (nor all other Vaishnava or even Krishnaite 

              Vaishnava bhakti movements) would relate to Hindu fundamentalism 

              and communal politics in the same way. Further empirical research 

              on Chaitanya Vaishnavas' current socio-political performance, what 

              to speak of that of other Hindu denominations, is much to be desired. 

              I would hope, however, that the ways by which I have analysed Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava <i>bhakti,</i> its distinctive mode of religious community, 

              and how this mode of Vaishnava community relates to Hindu communalism 

              might lend themselves to parallel studies of different <i>bhakti</i> 

              movements and other traditional and more recent Hindu religious 

              <i>sampradayas.</i>

            <p><b>Schematic Outline of Chaitanya Vaishnava Bhakti and its Basic 

              Relationship to Social and Political Affairs<br>

              <i>Basic religious orientation of Chaitanya Vaishnavas<br>
              </i></b>The religious orientation of Chaitanya Vaishnavas is very 
              well documented and readily accessible; it need only be highlighted 
              here.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#2">2</a> The Bengali Brahmin 
              ecstatic saint known as Chaitanya (1486-1533) is held by his devotees 
              to be the divine Lord Krishna in the form of perfect human devotee. 
              Specifically, Chaitanya is understood to be Krishna in human form, 
              having taken on the persona of the divine mistress Radha, the ultimate 
              exemplar of loving devotion (<i>prema-bhakti</i>) to Krishna. This 
              loving devotion (<i>prema-bhakti</i>), his devotees hold, constitutes 
              the <i>yuga-dharma</i>, the normative mode of religious practice 
              for the current age, the Kali-yuga. This <i>dharma</i> of loving 
              devotion supersedes in excellence and relativises (though it may 
              not invalidate altogether) other forms of <i>dharma,</i> including 
              certain kinds of Vedic and other Brahminical <i>dharmas.</i> This 
              new <i>dharma</i> teaches that every soul is in essence, even if 
              not behaving so in practice, a dependent servant (and at least potentially 
              a devotee) of Lord Krishna. 
            <p> Chaitanya Vaishnavas put special stress on the idyllic pastimes 

              (<i>lilas</i>) of Krishna - as baby, little boy and amorous youth 

              - rather than on Krishna the powerful adult warrior/statesman or 

              almighty Lord of Vaikuntha heaven. This distinctive mode of devotion, 

              featuring the gentler, more playful winsome and loving Krishna, 

              is called <i>madhurya</i> (sweetness, delicacy, affection). It permeates 

              the dedicated Chaitanya Vaishnavas' devotional life and affects 

              their orientation to socio-political affairs also.

            <p>In congregational gatherings, Chaitanya Vaishnavas are urged to 

              be accommodating, helpful, affectionate with one another. Their 

              ethos advocates humility and non-violence towards humans generally, 

              not just fellow Vaishnavas, and even to animals; they eschew blood 

              sacrifice and the eating of meat. Their festivals, even for the 

              deceased, are joyful affairs (<i>mahotsavas</i>): singing, dancing, 

              decorating images, feasting . . . celebrating with one another the 

              delightful and beautiful pastimes (<i>lilas</i>) and aspects of 

              Krishna with his eternal companions. Similarly, in private prayer 

              and meditation, Chaitanya Vaishnavas cultivate <i>madhurya,</i> 

              as they visualise and savour the sweetness, beauty and loveableness 

              of Krishna engaged in his pastimes.

            <p>The heroic events among Krishna's repertoire of sports - including 

              conquest of demons while He Himself is a mere child - they also 

              acknowledge, but do not dwell upon. These glimpses of His lordly 

              power, or <i>aishvarya,</i> remain just that: glimpses, not central 

              foci for celebration and meditation. For, according to Chaitanya 

              Vaishnavas, to allow power, or, to dominate one's devotional life 

              would create distance between Lord and devotee, would overshadow 

              intimacy by awe, would replace delightful spontaneity with dutiful 

              formality . . . which, the devotees say, is far less pleasing to 

              and devotee both.

            <p><b><i>Basic Socio-political Orientation of Chaitanya Vaishnava 

              Bhakti<br>

              </i></b>Chaitanya Vaishnavas, like so many communities of devotees, 

              maintain a heightened state of affectionate, relatively egalitarian 

              solidarity and ethos with fellow devotees, especially in congregational 

              gatherings. (The notion of communitas, as developed by Victor Turner 

              following Van Gennep, has considerable explanatory value in describing 

              the character of in-group religious attitudes and practices among 

              Chaitanya Vaishnava devotees.) The historical community, or communion, 

              of devotees embraces men and women, <i> brahmanas,sudras</i> and 

              sinners, as well as, in principle, persons outside Hindu society 

              altogether, provided they experience devotion to Krishna.

            <p>In the wider socio-political realm, however, as in marriage, business 

              and politics, that special solidarity and ethos may give way to 

              more structured, functional, impersonal relationships, even in dealings 

              with fellow devotees. Chaitanya Vaishnavas typically differentiates 

              the realm of devotional activities from the realm of practical affairs, 

              and they do not (except for a minority of recluses and mendicants) 

              cut themselves off from mundane activities. They are not sectarian, 

              but denominational. That is to say, they constitute a voluntary 

              community, or communion, of persons whose primary religious concern 

              is devotion to Krishna-Chaitanya, but who are expected to behave 

              responsibly in their respective historical socio-political situations. 

            <p>Certain authoritative Chaitanya Vaishnava writers appealed to the 
              principle of <i> lokasangraha</i> (holding the world together/maintaining 
              the general welfare), a principle also enunciated in the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> 
              by way of explaining how to participate responsibly in the environing 
              mundane world without fundamentally violating one's basic commitment 
              to <i>krishna-bhakti.</i> Rather than occasion unnecessary difficulties 
              and distractions, Vaishnavas should put up with less than ideal 
              conditions in the mundane, or <i>laukika,</i> sphere. The Chaitanyaite 
              interpretation of <i>lokasangraha</i> justifies participating in 
              public affairs, even under Muslim regimes (as well as under the 
              British colonial and independent Indian regimes). Chaitanya Vaishnavas 
              may also accede to many Brahmanic ritual-social customs even though 
              these may be judged to be devoid of sacral legitimation in and of 
              themselves. However, if governmental or Brahmanic or other interests 
              were to interfere seriously with their exercise of <i>krishna-bhakti, 
              </i> then devotees would be expected to object and seek redress, 
              preferably through discreet, negotiated settlements.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#3">3</a> 
            <p>A number of Chaitanya's prominent contemporary devotees held important 

              posts in the Muslim regime of the day, either at court or in the 

              revenue collection throughout Bengal. At least one highly placed 

              devotee in Husain Shah's court, Sanatana Goswami, the Sarkar Mallik, 

              resigned rather than participate in an anticipated attack on Orissa, 

              which would have meant devastation of temples there. Many prominent 

              Chaitanya Vaishnavas were comfortable working for the successor 

              British colonial regime.

            <p>One matter of principle, however, on which Chaitanya Vaishnavas 

              are expected not to even 'go through the motions' of Brahmanic customs 

              was <i>prayashcitta,</i> a class of purificatory/atonement rituals. 

              As only Krishna can break the bonds of karma, they insist, doing 

              <i>prayashcitta</i> would imply lack of faith in Krishna. On the 

              other hand, various <i>samskaras,</i> life-cycle rituals, could 

              be performed according to Brahmanic or other customary norms.

            <p>My reading of Chaitanya Vaishnava socio-political practice and 

              theory is that it implies acceptance of a religiously plural society, 

              with a broad zone of mundane activity that is neutral in religious 

              terms, neither sacred as deriving from any special revelation, nor 

              an abomination for not so deriving. Devotees are expected to act 

              intelligently and responsibly - discerning the demands of <i>lokasangraha</i> 

              (the general welfare) - in whatever social, economic or political 

              situations they find themselves. What they expect of the mundane, 

              or 'secular', realm, is that it function effectively in its various 

              operational sectors; and, of course, that it not violate the free 

              exercise of <i>krishna-bhakti,</i> in public or in private. Within 

              such a <i>laukika,</i> or secular, realm, it was taken for granted 

              that other religious communions too would practice their own modes 

              of religious life, even though more or less lacking in explicit 

              devotion to Krishna.

            <p><b><i>Application of this basic relationship to recent Hindu fundamentalism 

              and communalism<br>

              </i></b>What does this sketch of Chaitanya Vaishnava <i>bhakti</i> 

              and its socio-political orientation suggest about how devotees might 

              respond to contemporary Hindu fundamentalism and Hindu religio-communal 

              politics?

            <p>1. To begin with, consider the focus of Chaitanya Vaishnavas' faith. 

              They are committed in faith to devotion to one personal Lord Krishna, 

              not to Hinduism, Hindutva or the land of Bharata. Moreover, for 

              them the religiously valued community is the trans-temporal communion 

              of Krishna devotees, not a pan-Hindu community or Hindu national 

              state. Rama though revered by them as a lesser manifestation of 

              Krishna, has never been a central focus of Chaitanya Vaishnava piety. 

              Treating Rama as the arch-symbol of Hindu nationalism and the focal 

              point of agitational communal politics is altogether alien to Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava tradition.

            <p>2. Consider also the distinctive quality of religious experience 

              cherished by Chaitanya Vaishnavas. To them it is loving devotional 

              feelings and moods, <i>bhavas</i> and <i>rasas,</i> not socio-political 

              interests and enthusiasms, that are at the core of religious life. 

              Krishna is Himself <i>rasaraja,</i> the king of devotional mood; 

              Radha, his beloved, is <i>maha-bhava,</i> the great (amorous) feeling. 

              The whole thrust of Chaitanya Vaishnava literature, collective activities 

              and private religious discipline (<i>sadhana</i>) is to evoke, focus 

              properly, purify and enhance the whole gamut of traditional devotional-aesthetic 

              experiences. To do this effectively, they drew from Sanskrit dramaturgy 

              and poetics, propagated their own rich devotional literature, and 

              institutionalised a complex network of mechanisms designed to foster 

              <i>krishna-bhakti-rasa,</i> permeated by <i>madhurya</i>: sweetness, 

              gentleness, love.

            <p>Furthermore, Chaitanya Vaishnavas conspicuously 'failed' - 'declined' 

              might be more accurate - to transform their flexible devotional 

              movement into a structured organisation, refused to define simplistic 

              boundaries as to who is or is not 'within' the movement. They did 

              not allow their devotional communion to become identified with a 

              socico-political power. After the passing of Chaitanya they declined 

              to designate a central leader or governing body-such as might become 

              the focus of power struggles which could rupture solidarity and 

              shatter the mood of bhakti-rasa within the communion of devotees.

            <p>Much of current Hindu fundamentalist rhetoric, by contrast, seems 

              bent upon stirring up old resentments and generating new frustration 

              and hostility. Whereas humility and accommodation are virtues in 

              the eyes of traditional Chaitanya Vaishnavas, to Hindu fundamentalists 

              such attitudes bespeak weakness and degradation. Whereas the Chaitanya 

              Vaishnavas systematically avoid what might transform their devotional 

              communion into an ethnic community or mundane religio-political 

              force, Hindu fundamentalists strive to do just that: to weld Hindu 

              religious sentiments into a powerful communal political force leading 

              to a national religio-ethnic state. Whereas Chaitanya Vaishnavas 

              cherish the special refinement and richness of texture of their 

              distinctive mode of loving devotion to Krishna (and to fellow devotees, 

              human and transcendent), Hindu fundamentalists endeavour to supplant 

              the plethora of such <i>sampradaya</i>-specific pieties with a least 

              common denominator commitment to Hindutva (vaguely symbolised by 

              Rama) and to the Hindu nation, Bharata.

            <p>3. Further disparities between Chaitanya Vaishnavas and Hindu fundamentalists 

              might be noted, but let us now consider certain points of commonality, 

              or aspects of Chaitanya Vaishnava mentality which might lend themselves 

              to reinterpretation more favourable to Hindu fundamentalism and 

              communal politics.

            <ol type="a">

              <li>For one thing, there has long been a Vaishnava conviction that 

                those who molest Vaishnavas deserve the harshest of treatment: 

                the Lord will not pardon one who has molested a Vaishnava-unless 

                the offended Vaishnava first forgives the wrong-doer. In traditional 

                Chaitanya Vaishnava literature, however, this theme is usually 

                illustrated by episodes in which it is reconciliation that results 

                from conflict, not retribution; for, they say, did not Krishna 

                come as Chaitanya to propagate the <i>dharma</i> of loving devotion? 

                Still this theme conceivably could be seized upon and reworked 

                to motivate hostility to secularists, Muslims, Christians or any 

                other hypothetical enemies of Vaishnavas.</li>

              <li>Then again, the underlying identity of Rama and Krishna might 

                be stressed to gain sympathy of Krishna devotees, especially nominal 

                devotees, whose knowledge of the finer points of <i>krishna-bhakti</i> 

                is shallow, and whose numbers very likely are growing as modernity 

                wears away traditional knowledge and sensibilities.</li>

              <li>There is always the crass, or should we say practical, matter 

                of short- and long-term economic advantage and influence which 

                might well induce Vaishnavas of some prominence to be with the 

                winners, if they were to see the tide turning in favour of Hindu 

                communalist politics. Even Vaishnava leaders who might have misgivings 

                about Hindu fundamentalism and communal agitations might judge 

                that the institutions they represent would be more generously 

                treated by an explicitly Hindu government. And they might be wary 

                of inviting reprisals, if they were known to have opposed an eventually 

                triumphant communalist Hindu religio-political cause.</li>

              <li> Perhaps the one aspect of Chaitanya Vaishnavas' <i>bhakti</i> 

                in relation to socio-political affairs that could most facilitate 

                Hindu fundamentalist/communalist initiatives is their traditional 

                preference to not become active in political matters explicitly 

                and publicly as Chaitanya Vaishnavas. This tendency could render 

                devotees less inclined to detect and assess the threats posed 

                by fundamentalist and communalist Hinduism - not only to the secular 

                state in India but to the future of their own cherished mode of 

                loving devotion (<i>prema-bhakti</i>). It could also mean that 

                those Chaitanya Vaishnava spokesmen, if any, who would see trouble 

                in the waxing of the Hindutva cause might find it difficult to 

                make their concerns known promptly and effectively among fellow 

                devotees, not accustomed to think of confrontational politics 

                as pertinent to <i>bhakti.</i></li>

            </ol>

            <p>But at this point let us leave this schematic and somewhat idealised 

              account of <i>krishna-bhakti</i> as related to Hindutva in theory, 

              and shift to the fragmentary accounts of two observers of what is 

              actually going on among Chaitanya Vaishnavas in response to Hindu 

              communalism. As will be obvious, these accounts point up the need 

              for more systematic and extensive inquiries, if anything like a 

              definitive answer is to be given to the question of whether this 

              devotional movement (or any other) tends to reinforce, resist or 

              ignore the communalist Hindu religio-political cause.

            <p><b>Recent Observations on Chaitanya Vaishnava Response to Hindu 

              Fundamentalism and Communalism<br>

              <i>General comments<br>

              </i></b>The following remarks derive largely from my own observations 

              during visits to India in October to December 1990 and May to August 

              1992 and from a published report by Klaus Klostermaier of a visit 

              by him to India in January-February 1992. Most of the time of my 

              visits passed in West Bengal, where the Left Front Government until 

              then had been quite effective in containing communal politics and 

              violence. For instance, in November 1984, when Delhi and some other 

              north Indian cities were the scenes of massacres of Sikhs in reprisal 

              for the assassination of Prime Minister Gandhi, West Bengal quickly 

              snuffed out incipient anti-Sikh violence. Again in the days leading 

              up to the October 1990 aborted attack on the mosque at Ayodhya, 

              there were Hindu-Muslim solidarity marches by left parties, such 

              as those I witnessed in Bolpur near Santiniketan. But, after the 

              December 1992 razing of the mosque at Ayodhya, even West Bengal 

              was not immune to widespread communal violence.

            <p>The focus of my visits, however, was the spiritual exercises, or 

              <i>sadhana,</i> of the Chaitanya Vaishnavas, a topic that did not 

              directly relate to Hindu communal politics. Klaus Klostermaier, 

              on the other hand, in his visit to Uttar Pradesh, was directly concerned 

              to document the changes in Hindu religion, especially the politicisation, 

              in the three decades since his own residence at Vrindavana in 1962-64. 

              I also passed a month at Vrindavana in 1990 (and some days again 

              in 1992), situated in Uttar Pradesh, the state most affected by 

              Ayodhya-related agitations and communal violence. Our visits and 

              projects, though not strictly analogous, were closely enough related 

              to allow for some broad comparison. 

            <p><b><i>Vrindavana (and West Bengal) as observed by the author<br>

              </i></b>My own impressions during both visits was that among the 

              Chaitanya Vaishnavas with whom I was in contact there was very little 

              active involvement in Hindu communal activities. Not one of the 

              dozens of public Vaishnava <i>pujas,</i> discourses, <i>kirtans,</i> 

              processions, festivals etc. that I attended so much as alluded pro 

              or con to the Ayodhya struggle, Hindu-Muslim relations, or Hindu 

              communal politics. Only once while I was at Vrindavana in the month 

              after the Ayodhya debacle of 1990 did I hear a loudspeaker supporting 

              the Rama-janma-bhumi (birthplace of Rama) cause, but after fifteen 

              minutes it stopped and was not heard again. Though Hindi and English 

              newspapers available in Vrindavana were carrying quite sensationalist 

              reports and pictures of communal violence, there were relatively 

              few Hindu communalist graffiti to be seen, and little or no evidence 

              of incidents or demonstrations of a communal sort in the town (though 

              the paucity of Muslim residents in Vrindavana would in any event 

              minimise the local pretexts and targets for such things). 

            <p>I recall quite vividly the day I attended the closing session of 

              Bhagavata Path discourses in nearby Mathura, delivered to an audience 

              of upwards of five thousand outside the Krishna-janma-bhumi (birthplace) 

              temple. Not fifty feet from this new temple (erected since my first 

              Vrindavana visit in 1965) stands a comparably large mosque said 

              to have been erected on the site of Krishna's birth. I attended 

              - in the company of a Gujarati Hindu pilgrim I had met in Vrindavana 

              - with some anxiousness, as it was only a month or so after the 

              October 30, 1990 attack on the mosque at Ayodhya. That Babri Masjid 

              at Ayodhya is alleged by Hindu communalists to have been constructed 

              at the putative birthplace of Rama, using materials from a hypothetical 

              pre-existing Hindu temple on the site. At Ayodhya a number of rioters 

              had attained 'martyrdom' for the Hindu communal cause. The mosque 

              at Mathura, which also may well incorporate materials from pre-existing 

              Hindu, Jain and/or Buddhist edifices is looked upon by some Hindu 

              fundamentalists as next only to 'Babur's Mosque' at Ayodhya as an 

              offence to Hindu religion and self-respect and thus as another prime 

              target for demolition.

            <p>My observations at Mathura are fragmentary, as I was present for 

              only the last few hours of a multi-day series of talks. But, while 

              I was there, neither the concluding points of the lecturer nor the 

              closing formal remarks of the organisers made any obvious reference 

              to the Ayodhya struggle or other aspects of the Hindu political 

              agenda that I could notice. The themes were typical Vaishnava ones 

              that I had heard drawn out of the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> since 

              coming first to India nearly thirty years before. Among the thousands 

              of devotees present, there was no overt sign of awareness of, or 

              hostility toward, the large mosque adjacent to the temple. Police 

              were few, but adequate. There were no slogans, banners or signs 

              hostile to Muslims generally, to the mosque in particular, nor even 

              extolling Hindutva or the Hindu communal agenda. Interestingly, 

              one of the dignitaries present was of the Dalmia family (some of 

              whom had contributed handsomely to the temple at Mathura, and some 

              of whom are prominent in Vishva Hindu Parishad activities). The 

              bookstore in the temple complex - to which I made two subsequent 

              visits for purchase of books on <i>sadhana</i> -offered a variety 

              of Hindu texts, including some on Rama and the <i>Ramayana,</i> 

              but did not seem to be displaying provocative Hindu communalist 

              material.

            <p>Is it not striking that barely a month after the Ayodhya debacle, 

              while communal violence was still flaring up elsewhere in Uttar 

              Pradesh, so large and peaceable a Vaishnava assembly could take 

              place virtually in the shadow of the mosque at the Krishna-janma-bhumi, 

              and yet not even allude to the old mosque's presence? Does this 

              perhaps suggest that, where Vaishnava (and perhaps other forms of) 

              religiosity is amply experienced and expressed, there is no deeply 

              felt need to save Hinduism from Muslim or secular threat, nor to 

              restore a Hindu self-respect which had not been felt as lost? One 

              might also suspect that those who plan the strategy for popular 

              agitations and orchestrate riots would think twice about unleashing 

              upon Mathura a potentially destructive campaign to 'liberate' Krishna's 

              birthplace. Mathura as far more real estate and commercial interests 

              that would be at risk, as well as more religio-cultural involvements 

              by prominent Hindus, I would estimate, than did far-off Ayodhya, 

              a more expendable field of battle.

            <p>At no time during my Vrindavana visit did any Vaishnava <i>sadhu</i> 

              or layman with whom I was discussing Vaishnava practices bring up 

              on his own initiative such matters as the Ayodhya struggle and the 

              need to protect Hinduism, or express antagonism against Muslims 

              and Indian secularism. But, as my project was to learn about Vaishnava 

              <i>sadhana,</i> this is perhaps not surprising. But even in conversations 

              overheard on the pilgrimage train to Puri or in the slack periods 

              of the day while staying at <i>ashrams</i> and other Vaishnava institutions, 

              these issues hardly surfaced. Perhaps some of the same individuals, 

              if sequestered with persons they knew and trusted, or if gossiping 

              at work or leisure over tea, would have talked a different, more 

              political or communal line than when on pilgrimage or at an <i>ashram</i>, 

              I cannot say. But if they did harbour Hindu communalist concerns, 

              they did so in a mentally compartmentalised way, neither integrating 

              such concerns into their explicitly devotional life, so far as I 

              could see, nor trying to draw inspiration or legitimation for communal 

              Hindu agitations from <i>krishna-bhakti.</i>

            <p>On the few occasions when I did turn discussion to the current 

              communal strive, the most common reaction was to lament it and write 

              it off as 'politics'. Some of my interlocutors, however, confided 

              that Muslims had indeed been getting favoured treatment and that 

              it was hard to be Hindu publicly even in India. On one occasion 

              at Vrindavana, I did inquire of the secretary of an elderly <i>babaji</i> 

              his views on the Ayodhya struggle. Without noticeable rancour, he 

              said that the Muslims had done destructive things in the past and 

              were presently being favoured - precisely the themes upon which 

              the Hindu communalists harp and which can be used to stimulate and 

              condone violence. In his case, I did not detect any interest in 

              pursuing the communal agenda: the one practical project he was committed 

              to was distribution of his guru's many devotional publications.

            <p>By and large, I did not detect among Vaishnavas much sympathy for 

              Muslims as a threatened minority, even when communal violence was 

              being wreaked disproportionately against Muslims in the fall of 

              1990. That Muslims were in fact disproportionately the victims may 

              not have been common knowledge. Neither the secular governing interests 

              (sensitive to foreign perceptions and anxious to avoid yet more 

              reprisals that are violent) nor communal Hindu interests (intent 

              upon painting Muslims as the villains) were keen to highlight the 

              extent of Muslim victimisation. On the other hand, I did not detect 

              among the Vaishnavas I was associating with much real anger aimed 

              at Muslims, or at secular interests for that matter. Nor did my 

              interlocutors express any sense of religious duty, least of all 

              any Vaishnava imperative, to mobilise Hindu communal interests against 

              Muslim or secular threats. There simply did not seem to be much 

              concern or urgency over the whole communal upheaval in the Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava ashrams I visited in West Bengal and Vrindavana during 

              my last two trips to India. 

            <p>Among Chaitanya Vaishnavas, especially those in Bengal, the overall 
              impression I received was that what they considered important religiously, 
              that is, <i>krishna-bhakti,</i> was somehow insulated from whatever 
              was going on in the turbulent world of Hindi belt politics and religio-political 
              agitation.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#4">4</a> Pursuit of <i>krishna-bhakti</i> 
              typically seems to have fostered a tendency among those especially 
              devoted to turn away from the allurements and the pain of the mundane 
              world to seek the bliss of Krishna's pastimes. One may, as a devout 
              Vaishnava, retire or go on pilgrimage to Vrindavana to leave behind 
              such worldly distractions. But counter-balancing this tendency are 
              other Vaishnava norms to the effect that one must not shirk one's 
              duties, that one should not rush into celibacy, and so on. The pertinent 
              ideal norms for the Vaishnava devotee-citizen are ambivalent and 
              call for responsible decision. 
            <p>Chaitanya Vaishnavas' practice and discourse in the early 1990s 

              continued to be conducted within the basic symbolic patterns of 

              <i>krishna-bhakti</i> and the devotional communion. Krishna-Chaitanya 

              <i>bhakti</i> as such is highly distinctive and refined in its symbolism 

              and terminology and approved repertoire of devotional feelings. 

              Little of this traditional refinement and delicacy of feeling can 

              be found in what we are seeing of current Hindu communal religio-political 

              agitation. I have yet to encounter in written form, in public discourse 

              or private communication anything resembling a serious theological 

              (better 'ideological') reinterpretation of the specific symbols 

              and teachings of the Chaitanya Vaishnava tradition designed as an 

              explicit legitimation of Hindutva (ideological 'Hinduness') and 

              the communalist Hindu religio-political campaign. This does not 

              mean that there will not be (or may not be already in existence 

              but unknown to me) such ideological reinterpretations of Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava myths, symbols, doctrines and denominational history in 

              the interests of Hindutva. But such reinterpretations of Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava thought, if they do eventually come to the fore, will 

              be doing so in the wake of, not the vanguard of, the communalist 

              campaign for Hindutva. 

            <p><b><i>Vrindavana as observed by Klaus Klostermaier<br>
              </i></b>By contrast, Klaus Klostermaier, reporting on his visit 
              to India in January-February 1992 for research on religious change, 
              encountered what he considers evidence of a shift toward Hindu communal 
              politics even among Chaitanya Vaishnavas in Vrindavana and the surrounding 
              Vraj area.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#5">5</a> His report is part 
              of a three year research project on 'History of Vaishnavism in Uttar 
              Pradesh since 1947.' He observes Hindu communalist Vaishnavas and 
              others are overlooking the differences between <i>sampradayas</i> 
              in favour of pan-Hindu political action.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#6">6</a> 
            <p>Klostermaier, it may be noted, also uses the term 'denominational' 
              in referring to traditional <i>sampradayas,</i> but with denotation 
              and connotation markedly different from what I, following sociologists 
              Ernst Troeltsch and Talcott Parsons, am using for 'denomination'. 
              For Klostermaier, the denomination is intolerant, intent upon imposing 
              its position on others: 'Denominational religions likewise have 
              predominantly partisan interests; they want to see their particular 
              doctrines adopted, their sectarian expressions of religion imposed 
              upon people, their numbers of followers increased.'<a

 href="5_1communalfoot.html#7">7</a> 'Denomination', as the sociologists I am 
              following in this regard use the term, means a religious group, 
              the membership of which is voluntary (at least in principle), and 
              which group (in contrast with a 'church') does not claim to control 
              the social and economic-political life of the region in which it 
              is present, nor does it (in contrast with a 'sect') urge its members 
              to withdraw from social and economic-political activities of the 
              region. 
            <p>Klostermaier also notes that the ideal of the <i> sannyasi</i> 
              as withdrawn from mundane life is being replaced by one which places 
              the <i>sannyasi</i> in the forefront of even the political dimension 
              of the Hindu <i>jagaran,</i> 'Hindu awakening'. He notes in particular 
              how Vivekananda and Gandhi are seen as prototypes for this modern 
              merging of asceticism and religion with politics, though in ways 
              different from how Gandhi, if not Vivekananda, would have done it. 
              Alluding to the non-violence and humility traditionally attributed 
              to Vaishnavas, he writes pointedly: 'A rather radical rethinking 
              and readaptation may be necessary in the context of Vaishnavism.'<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#8"> 
              8</a> That such a 'radical re-thinking and re-adaptation' might 
              indeed be required reinforces my hypothesis that <i>bhakti</i> movements, 
              especially Vaishnava ones, may be so different in values from the 
              Hindutva cause as to provide resistance to the spread of Hindu communalism 
              - unless, of course, they give up their distinctiveness, in effect 
              cease to be the kinds of devotional <i> sampradayas</i> that have 
              been till now. Klostermaier makes the following observations: 
            <ul>

              <p>Objectively speaking, the rhetoric of today's RSS is much more 

                restrained as compared to that of 'guru' Golwalkar and 'Vir' Savarkar. 

                . . To the credit of RSS and VHP representatives whom I met, it 

                must be said that they are intelligent, upright and purposeful 

                persons. They know their Indian history, they have a keen eye 

                for the ills under which India is suffering, they have a strong 

                commitment to the well-being of India . . . Whether one likes 

                it or not, there is no doubt that most of Indian culture is Hindu 

                culture . . . A society has no doubt the right to defend its own 

                culture . . . <br>
                And here we have to sound a warning note. If Hinduism becomes 
                intolerant it will lose its own soul and be little more than an 
                ideology, an instrument in the hands of unscrupulous politicians 
                . . . Religion instead of acting as the independent arbiter of 
                public life, the conscience of a people, will be part and parcel 
                of the oppressive system itself and will sell its soul for the 
                sake of power.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#9">9</a> 
            </ul>

            <p>Klostermaier, it should be noted, does not make explicit how extensive 

              is the base of empirical evidence on which he is generalising; nor 

              is it altogether clear whether his more general observations apply 

              equally to Vrindavana and Uttar Pradesh as a whole. His Vrindavana 

              evidence per se cited in the article in question focuses on two 

              individuals and their immediate associates: the late Swami B. H. 

              Bon Maharaj, founder head of the Institute of Oriental Philosophy, 

              at whose ashram Klostermaier lived in 1962-64; and Padmanabha Goswami, 

              currently a hereditary priest at he Radharamana temple. 

            <p>Swami Bon, whom I also met several times between 1965 and 1978, 
              was an East Bengali Brahmin disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, 
              founder of the revivalist Gaudiya Math (and thus a guru-brother 
              of Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta, founder of the International Society 
              for Krishna Consciousness [ISKCON]). He was a talented and strong-willed 
              man, a disciplined ascetic, an articulate intellectual keen to see 
              Vaishnava theology at the forefront of modern religious thought 
              in India and worldwide.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#10">10</a> 
              Swami Bon's main scholarly publication, done with the aid of another 
              scholar, was an English translation of the first quarter of Rupa 
              Goswami's <i>Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu,</i> with paraphrases of several 
              commentaries. 
            <p>When the Gaudiya Math ruptured upon the death of its founder, Swami 

              Bon joined none of the hostile factions, but settled at Vrindavana, 

              where he eventually built his own <i>ashram</i> with Krishna temple 

              and a <i> samadhi</i> temple for himself. He also ran a school for 

              boys at Nandagram, not far from Vrindavana. He had wanted to found 

              a Vaishnava (not Hindu, it may be noted) Theological University 

              at Vrindavana, but his vision was cut down to the size of a small 

              college under the University of Agra. It was called the Institute 

              of Oriental Philosophy, however, as it included a small, not very 

              productive, post-graduate research section.

            <p>I stayed briefly at Swami Bon's <i>ashram</i> twice in 1965-67 

              and again in 1975. He once stayed at our home in Toronto for a few 

              days in the mid 1970's. We last met during Gaura-Purnima (Holi) 

              at Sri Mayapur, West Bengal in 1978, not long before his death. 

              His Toronto visit was part of a North America tour to generate support 

              for his last grand project: a Vrindavana-based institute for advanced 

              studies in religion, replete with endowed chairs for distinguished 

              scholars of various religions. Like some of his other more ambitious 

              schemes, it did not come to fruition. 

            <p>Swami Bon, though he had spent several years of voluntary austerity 
              in an underground cell, had a public and even political side to 
              him. He once served as president of an all-India <i>sadhus</i> association, 
              and even stood (unsuccessfully) as a Lok Sabha (parliament) candidate 
              of the Ram Rajya Parisad, a Hindu party headed by a Vaishnava ascetic, 
              Swami Karpatri. According to Klostermaier, there were in the early 
              1960s several members of the Hindu nationalist RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak 
              Sangh/ National Volunteer Corps) on the staff of the Institute of 
              Oriental Philosophy, but he does not say that Swami Bon was ever 
              an RSS man.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#11"> 11</a> Klostermaier 
              recalls how Swami Bon used to rant against the 'atheism' of the 
              Nehru Government-perhaps reflecting disappointment that his envisioned 
              Vaishnava Theological University was being thwarted, a theme I too 
              recall him voicing. 
            <p>Klostermaier's other example of Hindu communal politics among Vrindavana 
              Vaishnavas is Padmanabha Goswami, one of a large lineage of hereditary 
              priests of the Radharamana temple. These Goswamis are descendants 
              of the priest deputed by one of Chaitanya's learned disciples, Gopala 
              Bhatta, to serve his consecrated Krishna <i>murti</i> (image) named 
              Radharamana. I do not recall having met or heard of Padmanabha Goswami 
              and do not know how much he maintains the devotional and cultural 
              traditions of a Chaitanya Vaishnava Goswami. When asked by Klostermaier 
              in 1992 about the RSS in Vrindavana, Padmanabha was initially 'taken 
              aback'; but then he took Klostermaier into his confidence. He told 
              him that 'he himself was the local RSS chief, an active member of 
              the Vishva Hindu Parishad . . . and that he was also involved with 
              the Bharatiya Janata Party, which had recently organised the Ramitula 
              Yatra, during which he (Padmanabha) had been arrested and then released 
              on Government orders.' <a href="5_1communalfoot.html#12">12</a> 
              Padmanabha showed Klostermaier documents and publications of the 
              Hindu communalist organisations, briefed him on coming events in 
              India and abroad, and had him address a meeting of RSS and VHP members. 
            <p>Subsequently, Padmanabha took Klostermaier to meet Swami Vamadeva, 

              founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, and Swami Muktananda, 

              the current Secretary General of the Samiti. Swami Vamadeva is of 

              a Dasnami order, often considered theological adversaries by Vaishnavas 

              like the Chaitanyaites. This prompted Klostermaier to observe:

            <ul>

              <p>While the more conservative among the Vaishnavas in Vrindaban 
                consider the increasing influx of 'Mayavadis' as unwelcome and 
                objectionable, people like Padmanabha Goswami . . . appreciate 
                the strong political leadership provided by men like Vamadeva 
                and Muktananda, their eloquence on behalf of the Hindu cause, 
                and their unequivocal hostility towards the 'secular' government.<a href="5_1communalfoot.html#13">13</a> 
            </ul>

            <p><b>Comparative Assessment and Suggestions for Further Inquiry<br>

              </b>What then is really going on among Chaitanya Vaishnavas in Vrindavana, 

              their main centre outside Bengal? Are they generally becoming Hindu 

              communalists? Or are 'the conservatives among them' (those for whom 

              religion still means <i>krishna-bhakti</i> in the distinctive Chaitanya 

              Vaishnava mode) retaining their influence and the integrity of their 

              kind of <i>bhakti</i>? Klostermaier's portrayal of 'the new <i>dharma</i> 

              of Braj' suggests that there is indeed a major shift going on in 

              Braj, from traditional to modern, from apolitical to political, 

              from specifically Vaishnava to generically Hindu, from non-violent 

              accommodation to violent confrontation. This may or may not be the 

              case, but persuasive empirical evidence of such a shift is yet to 

              be supplied.

            <p>Apart from Padmanabha Goswami, the only Chaitanya Vaishnava of 

              any prominence at Vrindavana identified by Klostermaier as involved 

              in Hindu communal politics, namely Swami Bon, has been dead for 

              fifteen years; and the high point of his involvement was back in 

              the 1950s. Thereafter it was theology and comparative religious 

              philosophy that he was promoting, not religio-political theology 

              and partisan politics. Moreover, it was specifically Chaitanya Vaishnava 

              theology that was at the centre of his theological-cum-philosophical 

              projects, not generic Hinduism, let alone ideological Hindutva. 

              Swami Bon could as well be characterised as moving away from religious 

              politics and communal Hinduism for the last thirty years of his 

              life, though he still wished to see Vaishnava and other modes of 

              religious life more prominent in Indian and world affairs. The Swami 

              remained critical of incompetence, corruption and 'atheism' in high 

              places. But I find it difficult to imagine him condoning the vulgarity 

              and barbarism of recent Hindu communal political agitations.

            <p>We have as yet no adequate evidence of trends within the Vrindavana 

              Vaishnava population, though one may suspect that trends toward 

              greater Hindu communalism, so evident elsewhere in Uttar Pradesh, 

              are at work in Vrindavana itself, especially among the many individuals 

              who are there by birth, rather than by devotional choice. But this 

              too remains conjecture in the absence of empirical study. However, 

              it does seem to me to be both interesting and important-on theoretical 

              as well as practical grounds - to ask whether the concentration 

              of Vaishnava devotees of Krishna (from the Chaitanya <i>sampradaya</i> 

              and several others) at Vrindavana correlates with greater reinforcement 

              of or more resistance to Hindu communalism (or shows no significant 

              difference) when compared with other towns of comparable size in 

              Uttar Pradesh, but without such a concentration of traditional religious 

              personnel and institutional resources.

            <p>It might also be informative to compare the respective attitudes 

              toward Hindu communal politics in towns or cities held to be especially 

              sacred respectively by each of several different Hindu denominations 

              or <i>sampradayas.</i> If it could be determined that Vrindavana, 

              or any other towns where the 'density' or 'intensity' of a <i>bhakti</i> 

              movement is very high, has a significantly greater resistance to 

              Hindu communalism, it might point to an as yet under-appreciated 

              and under-utilised source of resilience on the part of traditional 

              Hindu socio-cultural and religious system, with its pluralistic, 

              accommodating, even 'secular' (in sense proposed earlier in this 

              essay) characteristics. If the correlation should prove to be otherwise, 

              so also, of course, would the implications be otherwise.

            <p>Finally, to generalise the issue, it would seem to me to be useful 

              to do a study of those 'religious' individuals and institutions 

              most prominent in the Vishva Hindu Parishad (and any other Hindu 

              communalist organisations) to determine just what is the distribution 

              of Hindu <i>sampradayas</i> to be found therein. How representative 

              of, and influential in, the respective <i>sampradayas</i> are the 

              individuals who are (or appear to be) representing the <i>sampradayas</i> 

              in these communal organisations? Does the representation of <i>sampradayas</i> 

              as found in such Hindu communalist organisations more or less reflect 

              the distribution of <i>sampradayas</i> in the country (or region) 

              as a whole? If not, what are the correlations between particular 

              <i>sampradayas</i> and participation in Hindu communalist organisations? 

              If any striking correlations, high or low, of particular <i>sampradayas</i> 

              with participation in the communalist organisations emerge, then 

              these cases might be selected for more intensive study to discover 

              why there is such unusual involvement or non-involvement in (or 

              overt opposition to) Hindu communal politics. Whatever may be the 

              case with other traditional <i>bhakti</i> sampradayas, it would 

              be very surprising to me if, upon more thorough scrutiny, the Chaitanya 

              Vaishnavas were to emerge as at all prominent in the current surge 

              of Hindu communal politics. On the other hand, whether they have 

              (or are likely to) put up serious resistance to that surge is another 

              question, one well worth further inquiry.

                    <p>The Alchemical Body excavates and centres within its Indian 

                      context the lost tradition of the medieval Siddhas. Working 

                      from a body of previously unexplored alchemical sources, 

                      David Gordon White demonstrates for the first time that 

                      the medieval disciplines of Hindu alchemy and hatha-yoga 

                      were practised by the same people, and that they can only 

                      be understood when viewed together.&nbsp; White opens the 

                      way to a new and more comprehensive understanding of medieval 

                      Indian mysticism, within the broader context of South Asian 

                      Hinduism, Jainism and Islam.

                    <p>This book offers useful insights into the complex and internally 

                      diverse realm of Hinduism. It is intended to acquaint the 

                      reader with themes and issues that, while of relevance to 

                      all religious traditions and systems, contribute to an understanding 

                      of the abstract nature of Hinduism as a whole. Beginning 

                      with Hindu religious understandings of the human condition, 

                      the chapters are arranged so as to form a thematic survey 

                      and overview of Hindu religious beliefs and practices. The 

                      themes of morality and ethics, the role of women in Hinduism, 

                      the Hindu religious construction of nature, and issues such 

                      as mythology, the status of texts, forms of worship, and 

                      sacred time and place can be systematically considered; 

                      or, alternatively, focus can fall upon those topics that 

                      are of particular personal interest. Readers should find 

                      this book a wide-ranging and balanced introduction to Hinduism's 

                      inner diversity.</p>

                    <p>Written for students of comparative religion and the general

                    <p>What is one to make of a group of goddesses that includes 

                      a goddess who cuts her own head off, a goddess who sits 

                      on a corpse while pulling the tongue of a demon, or a goddess 

                      who prefers sex with corpses? Tantric Visions of the Divine 

                      Feminine deals with a group of ten Hindu Mahavidyas, who 

                      embody habits, attributes or identities usually considered 

                      repulsive or socially subversive.&nbsp; It is within the 

                      context of tantric worship that devotees seek to identify 

                      themselves with these forbidding goddesses.&nbsp; The Mahavidyas 

                      seem to function as 'awakeners' - symbols that help to project 

                      one's consciousness beyond the socially acceptable or predictable. 

                    <p>Kinsley not only describes the eccentric qualities of each 

                      of these goddesses but seeks to interpret the Mahavidyas 

                      as a group and to explain their importance for understanding 

                      Tantra and the Hindu tradition.

                    <p>No religion ever remains static: it affects and is in turn 

                      affected by material reality.&nbsp; It is the creative tension 

                      embodied in this dynamic which makes the world of religion, 

                      rich with possibilities. 

                    <p>This book examines the contours of this creative tension 

                      in the context of Hinduism in our own times. For Hinduism, 

                      a religion of unknown antiquity is also, in several ways, 

                      surprisingly modern. Hinduism for Our Times is an attempt 

                      to raise this dimension of Hinduism to an unprecedented 

                      level of self-awareness.&nbsp; Thus the choices that Hindus 

                      must make in the context of modernisation and globalisation 

                      become conscious as opposed to random choices, choices which 

                      will place Hinduism at the cutting edge of the contemporary 

                      world instead of consigning it to the periphery.&nbsp; This 

                      book will appeal to all those interested in giving religion 

                      a modern agenda.
