            Edited: Christopher Chapple</b> 
            <p><i>The Jesuit Tradition in Education and Missions</i> is a collection 
              of articles that explore and document a history of the movement 
              with respect to these two fields. For anyone that may ask what does 
              this have to do with ISKCON? I can point to a number of reasons 
              why this publication is of interest to us. 
            <p>ISKCON is a fledgling movement in relation to the Jesuits. If we 
              examine the history of other groups, we can learn from their mistakes 
              as well as successes. We ignore more mature foundations to our detriment 
              if we disregard them merely for coming form a different tradition. 
              In fact, we may actually find that we have something in common if 
              we care to approach with an open mind. 
            <p>Looking at the first guiding principle for every task laid out 
              by the founding father of the Jesuit movement, Ignatius de Loyola, 
              in his 'Spiritual Exercises' is that 'every man is created to praise, 
              reverence and serve God our Lord, and by this means to save his 
              soul. The other things on the face of the earth are created for 
              man to help him attain the end for which he was created.' These 
              sentiments are very similar to our own movement. Given this similarity 
              it would seem wise to study the history of the Jesuit Society since 
              it is much older than our own movement and see what lessons we can 
              be glean from it. 
            <p>For those unfamiliar with the Society of Jesus, it was born in 
              the first half of the sixteenth century, in Italy, as a means of 
              countering the attack by the Protestants on the Catholic faith. 
              The society was an invaluable asset to the Catholic Church as it 
              attempted to systematically eradicate malpractice and ignorance 
              in the priesthood as well as in the laity, and the principle means 
              by which they achieved this, was through education. 
            <p>In this collection, we find possible approaches from which we can 
              proceed to look at our own institution. For example, Francesco Cesareo 
              examines the ideals of the Jesuit education for the sixteenth century 
              to discover exactly why the Jesuit formula was so successful. Within 
              forty-five years of its foundation, the society had founded 144 
              colleges and by 1749, they had grown so large as to accommodate 
              669 colleges and 24 universities around the world. In fact, Jesuit 
              schools became the main stream for all Europe. Surely, there must 
              be something we can learn from this phenomenal success. 
            <p>How and why were the Jesuits so successful? It seems their success 
              stemmed from the clarity of vision about the ultimate aim of education, 
              which was to prepare sound Christian individuals that used their 
              learning to spread the faith, together with a systematic curriculum 
              to prepare students for this task. This was the vision of the founder 
              of the order, Ignatius Loyola. Their mission was further enhanced 
              by the fact that their educational institutions were highly adaptable 
              to changing times. 
            <p>Present day Jesuit education in America is also addressed. Joseph 
              O'Hare sensitively, yet firmly examines present day problems in 
              education policy. Throughout the 1950s and the 1960s Jesuit institutions 
              expanded in complexity and size, however, this expansion outstripped 
              the number of Jesuits available to enter these institutions. 
            <p>Questions are raised about academic standards since Jesuit institutions 
              have been renowned for their academic excellence, why then did they 
              not feature even in the top twenty USA education institutions? Should 
              they aim for one super-excellent Jesuit institution? There is strength 
              in planning for the future by anticipating future issues before 
              they happen. O'Hare recognises that the future of Jesuit institutions 
              will depend more and more on the commitment of non-Jesuits, and 
              therefore he encourages dialogue and collaboration between the two 
              for the inevitable changes that will happen. In preparing for change 
              in this way, Jesuits can ensure that change will be healthy and 
              that the Ignation vision is held at the core of each of these institutions. 
            <p>The openness of discourse, continual introspection, revaluation 
              and observation of their education programme allows for a programme 
              that is focussed upon the vision of their founding father, while 
              still being relevant to contemporary times. Similarly, if ISKCON 
              is to grow and expand it is going to have to be facilitated by a 
              strong education program. We need to address how we are going to 
              provide for both its full-time and congregation members. The Jesuits 
              were successful because they planned and provided for different 
              abilities and purposes. At present the Jesuits enjoy over one million 
              alumni in America, many enjoying positions of leadership in the 
              corporate world, in public life an in educational institutions both 
              Catholic and secular. For the Jesuits, it has been useful to have 
              followers in all sectors of society, because it sends signals to 
              other members of that society that Jesuits are willing to make a 
              full and positive contribution to the community in a way that non-Jesuits 
              can relate, while still being able to contribute to their movement. 
              If we look at our movement, many devotee children are going to grow 
              up and marry, and that will mean sustaining oneself in the outside 
              world. How are we going to equip them for this role? What part do 
              we want our children to play in outside society? Or are we only 
              going to provide education for full-time preachers? 
            <p>We must not also forget the needs of the congregation in terms 
              of fulfilling their educational needs. Looking back at my own struggle 
              to educate myself in Krishna consciousness, I feel there is a need 
              to direct the education of the congregation through a systematic 
              and structured education programme. Perhaps the use of supplementary 
              books to Srila Prabhupada's major works may be used as a guide to 
              learning the fundamentals of Vaishnavism. In fact there has been 
              a recent publication in England called '<i>Inviting Krishna into 
              my Life</i>' which is a good basic guide to new comers and congregation 
              members, and perhaps it would be useful if publications such as 
              these can be more widely circulated. 
            <p>Above all, <i>The Jesuit Tradition</i> is useful to us as an example 
              of how institutional disputes can be openly aired and healthy discourse 
              encouraged to resolve opposing views. Thomas Fasse's essay allows 
              a forum for discussion for the diverging opinions over the future 
              of the Jesuit education programme in America. The author first tries 
              to find the converging factors of the three General Congregations 
              (supreme governing body of the Jesuits) on practical action for 
              faith and justice and then reviews the impediments of implementing 
              that action, the predicament of compromised policies and the prospects 
              for the future resolution of the crisis. Above all, there is a willingness 
              to adapt and change as well as admit errors, and it is precisely 
              this type of approach that will help us avoid mistakes such as those 
              blunders made by ISKCON in the 1980s. We need to learn how to develop 
              the institutional machinery of our society from those more experienced 
              than ourselves, after all, Srila Prabhupada wanted his society to 
              be highly organised to carry out its most important purpose: to 
              spread Krishna Consciousness, therefore we should open our eyes 
              to the histories of other organisations to minimise our errors and 
              to ensure better efficiency of our own organisation.
