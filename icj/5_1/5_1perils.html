            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>Imagine, if you will, a seventy-year-old Hindu Vaishnava scholar 
              journeying from India aboard a steamship bound for America. His 
              personal effects consist of but a few sets of saffron renunciate's 
              cloth, a pair of white rubber shoes, and forty rupees ('hardly a 
              day's spending money,' he would later remark after arriving in New 
              York City). Though asking for alms is a privilege of his calling, 
              he has no intention of begging. Before taking the vow of renunciation 
              (<i>sannyasa</i>), he had a family, a business and hailed from a 
              community of Bengali merchants who prospered during the British 
              Raj. Now he had, stowed amidst the ship's cargo, three treasure 
              chests filled with sets of his published translations of the ancient 
              <i>Bhagavata-Purana</i>. These priceless treasures are to be both 
              the basis of his mission and the means of his survival, but he wonders 
              how the West will receive them. Arriving at Boston Harbour on 17, 
              September 1965, observing the awesome display of material success 
              played out on the American skyline, he composes the following lines: 
            <ul>
              <p>My dear Lord Krishna, You are so kind upon this useless soul, 
                but I do not know why You have brought me here. Now You can do 
                whatever You like with me. But I guess You have some business 
                here, otherwise why would You bring me to this terrible place? 
                Most of the population here is covered by the material modes of 
                ignorance and passion. Absorbed in material life, they think themselves 
                very happy and satisfied, and therefore they have no taste for 
                the transcendental message of Vasudeva. I do not know how they 
                will be able to understand it (Goswami, S. 1983: Vol. II: p281). 
            </ul>
            <p>From the moment of his landing, his thoughts pregnant with uncertainty, 
              to his first temples in the counter-culture capitals of New York's 
              Lower East Side and San Francisco's Haight, A. C. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami focused his mission: to transplant the sacred wisdom of India 
              into the fertile soil of the West. His mission was time-bound, no 
              less by his advanced age, than by the growing secularism which had 
              already begun to uproot his motherland's timeworn traditions. If 
              his fledgling attempt succeeded in America, he would not only export 
              it all over the world, but use it to rekindle the flagging spirit 
              of his own countrymen. 
            <p>Prabhupada (to use the respectful address later given Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami by his disciples) brought to his task some exceptional qualifications. 
              His religious education began in childhood under the tutelage of 
              devout parents. Later, he attended compulsory Bible classes while 
              majoring in philosophy, Sanskrit and English Literature at Calcutta's 
              Scottish Churches' College. Family obligations then obliged him 
              to pursue a business career that provided him skills as an organiser. 
              But the missionary zeal, which energised the second half of his 
              life, was a consequence of none of these. Rather, it was the direct 
              influence of his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. 
            <p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's lineage is traced to the fifteenth 
              century saint Shri Chaitanya, who is considered by the tradition 
              to be an incarnation of the Godhead with other gods subordinate 
              to him. Chaitanyaism, or more correctly Gaudiya-Vaishnavism, traces 
              its line further back to the thirteenth century teacher Madhva and, 
              the tradition holds, to the creator Brahma and before him, the Godhead 
              Krishna. The various branches of Vaishnavism are clearly monotheistic, 
              worshipping Vishnu or one of his prominent manifestations as the 
              Supreme Deity. The nuances which differentiate each of the schools 
              of Vaishnavism will not concern us here apart from distinguishing 
              Sri Chaitanya's teaching which is compressed within the slogan <i>acintya-bhedabheda-tattva</i> 
              - the inconceivable simultaneous oneness and difference between 
              God and the individual soul. 
            <p>The foundation of Chaitanya's philosophy is the Bhagavata-Purana, 
              a Sanskrit compilation of prodigious length, attributed to Vyasadeva. 
              Chaitanya's followers produced a vast corpus of original work as 
              well as commentaries on the Bhagavata and other classic texts. A 
              formidable library was thus created to firmly fix the sect's teachings. 
              As an initiated disciple in the line of Chaitanya, Prabhupada studied 
              and published articles on many of these texts and in 1939 was awarded 
              the title 'Bhaktivedanta' by his godbrothers in recognition of his 
              scholarship (Goswami, S. 1980: Vol. I: 103). 
            <p>While much care was taken to insure the sect's textual orthodoxy, 
              organisationally Chaitanya's movement was nothing more than numerous 
              disciplic lines descended from his original followers. Though doctrinal 
              differences often differentiated them, they were bound together 
              only by their collective allegiance to Chaitanya, not by any common 
              organisational affiliation. An effort to resolve this lack of cohesion 
              was made by Kedaranatha Datta, later known as Bhaktivinoda Thakura. 
              The father of Prabhupada's guru Bhaktisiddhanta, Bhaktivinoda served 
              as Chief Magistrate of the High Court in Puri, Orissa, a post that 
              included honorary jurisdiction over the ancient temple of Jagannatha. 
              He was an avid student of world religions. A spiritual search eventually 
              led him to rediscover his own Chaitanya tradition, and he became 
              its most ardent champion. Over the centuries, its prestige had become 
              tarnished by various <i>sahajiya</i> sects who often sacramentalised 
              sex. Bhaktivinoda concluded that they misconstrued the theology, 
              claiming allegiance to Chaitanya without strictly following his 
              pure discipline. Bhaktivinoda proceeded to renovate the line. Most 
              importantly for our purpose here, for the first time he gave Chaitanya's 
              movement coherent organisational structure, creating a loose confederation 
              which he dubbed Sri Nama-Hatta, 'the market place of the holy name.'<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#1"> 
              1</a> Using the influence of his office, he vigorously organised 
              a massive network of practitioners, creating a hierarchy of leadership 
              and designating for himself the humble role of 'sweeper' of the 
              market place-in effect, 'protector of the faith'. (See Bhaktivinoda 
              1983: 17) 
            <p>Bhaktivinoda's son continued the work begun by his father. Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati founded the Gaudiya Matha with its sixty-four affiliated 
              temples and initiated some sixty thousand disciples. Keeping in 
              the spirit of his father, not only was he a prolific author and 
              publisher of Chaitanyaite literature, but he also further standardised 
              the Chaitanyaite devotional practices while erecting a tightly knit 
              organisational superstructure. However, the weakness of that structure 
              was revealed only after he expired. His chief followers failed to 
              abide by his final instruction to form a governing body that would 
              replace him as the ultimate authority. Consequently, the Gaudiya 
              Matha succumbed to factionalism and legal bickering over the division 
              of the vast holdings accumulated during the lifetime of its founder. 
            <p>Prabhupada's solitary voyage to the West was as much due to his 
              disgust at seeing his guru's institution fracture as to the missionary 
              order he had received from him. He was determined that the society 
              he formed would not repeat the failure of succession that had befallen 
              the mission of his guru. But given the strangeness of his religious 
              and cultural message as well as the youth of his first followers, 
              the same problems of succession were practically inevitable. 
            <p>Perhaps the most formidable, and certainly the first, obstacle 
              to overcome was his Western audience's relative unfamiliarity with 
              Chaitanya's teachings. He would have to unpack the densely encoded 
              Sanskrit texts for his Western readers. For this purpose, he reached 
              beyond the specific Chaitanya liturgy to the <i>Bhagavad-gita, Isopanishad 
              </i>and<i> Bhagavata-Purana</i>. His 'Bhaktivedanta Purports,' heavily 
              stamped with his devotion for Krishna, were meant to insure his 
              followers absolute fidelity. As he would declare in 1975, 'My books 
              will be the law books for the next ten thousand years.'<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#2">2</a> 
            <p>But Prabhupada quickly discovered that while his young American 
              converts could easily modify their hippie habits to conform to the 
              monastic discipline, it was far more difficult for them to leave 
              behind their intellectual baggage. Obedience to authority of any 
              sort was the thing his largely youthful audience found most abhorrent. 
              If subservience to the guru's instructions was something even his 
              advanced godbrothers in India had found difficult, could these young 
              Americans be expected to conquer their own rebelliousness? As often 
              and repeatedly as he beat them with mantras and lessons, at least 
              a few could not. One disciple in particular, Kirtanananda Swami 
              - the very first to shave his head and don the traditional monk's 
              robes of a <i>sannyasi</i> as early as 1966 - proved to be incorrigible. 
            <p>The early case of Kirtanananda Swami forecast the problems of succession 
              that lay ahead, problems of authority and of the continuity of tradition, 
              faced both by Prabhupada and later, by his disciples after Prabhupada's 
              departure. While he might personally be able to nourish and protect 
              the movement in its infancy, its inevitable expansion would require 
              a suitable superstructure that would endure the crisis created by 
              his demise. 
            <p>E. Burke Rochford, Jr. and Larry D. Shinn in their respective works, 
              and ISKCON scholar Ravindra Svarupa dasa in a number of essays, 
              have amply documented the struggle for authority created by Prabhupada's 
              departure (See Rochford, E. B., Jr. 1985, Shinn, Larry 1987: 47-60, 
              and dasa, Ravindra Svarupa 1985, 1994). All three scholars more 
              or less concur on identifying the major issues: 'who are the real 
              inheritors of Prabhupada's mantle? The new gurus? The GBC? All the 
              disciples of Prabhupada who have the capacity to be gurus? No easy 
              answers emerged in the years following Prabhupada's death.' (Shinn, 
              1987: 49).<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#3">3</a> 
            <p> Two prominent Indian supporters of ISKCON raised the same questions 
              when they met Prabhupada in Vrindavana shortly before his death 
              in 1977.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#4">4</a> Would Prabhupada appoint 
              a single successor from among his followers? Prabhupada's answer: 
              All his disciples would succeed him. The response disappointed them, 
              for they had in mind the autocratic guru of Hindu tradition. Perhaps 
              if they had been more familiar with Prabhupada's teachings they 
              would not have been so surprised. In a purport to the <i>Shri Chaitanya-caritamrita</i> 
              (Adi-lila, 12.8), he writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, at the time of his departure, 
                requested all his disciples to form a governing body and conduct 
                missionary activity cooperatively. He did not instruct a particular 
                man to become the next <i>acarya.</i> But just after his passing 
                away, his leading secretaries made plans, without authority, to 
                occupy the post of <i>acarya,</i> and they split into two factions 
                over who the next <i>acarya</i> would be. Consequently, both factions 
                were <i>asura,</i> or useless, because they had no authority, 
                having disobeyed the order of the spiritual master (Prabhupada1975). 
            </ul>
            <p>Indeed, Lord Chaitanya had given an open order for all to &quot;become 
              a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.&quot;<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#5">5</a> 
              But a succession of 'all' is a succession of none. Yet, anarchy 
              was certainly not Prabhupada's intention. 
            <p>In the disobedience of his first disciple Kirtanananda, Prabhupada 
              recognised the seeds of dissent, which, if left unchecked, would 
              dismantle his fledgling institution. Kirtanananda's challenge must 
              have convinced Prabhupada that he needed to train his disciples 
              quickly in order to form a governing board to insure the institution's 
              cohesion, particularly when he was no longer present. At least while 
              he was present he could lay the foundation and construct the framework 
              for his vision of a vast missionary movement. Thus by 1970, four 
              years after incorporating the International Society for Krishna 
              Consciousness (ISKCON), Prabhupada established the Governing Body 
              Commission (GBC), as his 'direct representatives to act as the instrument 
              for the execution of the will of His Divine Grace'. (Goswami, S. 
              1982: Vol. IV: 103-104)<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#6"> 6</a> But 
              an organisational superstructure is no better than its members and 
              therein lay a huge problem. 
            <p>Kirtanananda Swami was the son of a Southern Baptist minister. 
              Initiated by Prabhupada into the order of <i>sannyasa</i> while 
              accompanying his master to India, Kirtanananda believed that the 
              spreading of Krishna consciousness was hampered by the devotees' 
              odd appearance - by the traditional robes and <i>sikha,</i> the 
              tuft of hair left on an otherwise cleanly shaven head.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#7">7</a> 
              But Kirtanananda and his spiritual master disagreed on more than 
              what constituted proper devotional attire. Underlying the misgiving 
              about dress, were Kirtanananda's doubts about dualism: he could 
              not distinguish between the impersonal and personal features of 
              Krishna, between the soul as individually distinct from the Godhead 
              (See letters to Brahmananda, Rayarama, and Gargamuni, Prabhupada1987: 
              229-230, 232). 
            <p>Prabhupada's initial response to Kirtanananda's deviation was novel: 
              rather than condemning his speculations, he suggested that Kirtanananda 
              stop in London on his return to America in order to test out his 
              ideas. But Kirtanananda circumvented his guru's order, flying directly 
              to New York where he made his godbrothers the target of his new 
              gospel. Prabhupada tightened the screws: he ordered that Kirtanananda 
              should be stopped from speaking in any of the society's temples.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#8">8 
              </a> When his disciples wrote to India repeating Kirtanananda's 
              arguments, Prabhupada refuted impersonalism in each of his replies. 
              Yet he did not reject his wayward disciple; Kirtanananda's confusion, 
              he suggested, was a &quot;temporary manifestation of maya [illusion]&quot; 
              and &quot;will be corrected as soon as I return&quot; (See letter 
              to Himavati, Prabhupada1987: 241-2). 
            <p>Prabhupada explained that he signed all his letters to disciples 
              as 'Your ever well-wisher' to indicate that he remained ever concerned 
              for his disciples, even if they left him. But other disciples found 
              it difficult to embrace their spiritual master's mood. They spat 
              on Kirtanananda and ejected him from the temple (See letter to Rayarama, 
              Prabhupada1987: 243-4).<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#9">9</a> 
            <p> Kirtanananda's mistaken attitude, Prabhupada ultimately concluded, 
              was based on his refusal to accept the <i>parampara</i> (disciplic 
              succession) system and the authority of the scriptures. His misfortune, 
              however, proved a learning experience for the other disciples. Though 
              one or two had been swayed by Kirtanananda's arguments, the majority 
              had become strengthened by successfully defending their guru's teachings. 
              The harsh response of the spitting incidents was tempered by Prabhupada's 
              abiding concern for even one who had turned against him. Consequently, 
              within a matter of months, Kirtanananda had recanted and apologised 
              and began work once more under his master to establish the New Vrindaban, 
              West Virginia community. Though time would prove that his philosophical 
              misconceptions were not in fact corrected, Prabhupada's skilful 
              handling of the incident allowed Kirtanananda to return, at least 
              temporarily, to active and beneficial service for ISKCON. <a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#10">10</a> 
            <p>The Kirtanananda incident is the first instance of an open challenge 
              to the founder's authority. It was not Prabhupada alone but the 
              authority of the entire disciplic line and the scriptures that were 
              being questioned. In the Christian tradition, such challenges were 
              regarded as heresy; and the heretic was considered as evil: 
            <ul>
              <p>The word heresy is derived from a Greek word meaning 'choice.' 
                It had been used to designate the particular teachings of philosophical 
                schools, and it denoted the opinions that each one had chosen. 
                Christian writers began to use the term and soon gave it a pejorative 
                significance. To them it indicated that a person had chosen a 
                human opinion and rejected divine revelation. In this sense heresy 
                has an evil significance, and the heretic is considered evil (Tyson 
                1984: 410). 
            </ul>
            <p> We may note, in comparison, that in Prabhupada's estimation Kirtanananda 
              deviated from the authority of the disciplic line and scripture, 
              which was for ISKCON a rejection of divine revelation in favour 
              of human opinion. Prabhupada treated Kirtanananda's influence as 
              an evil to be carefully guarded against, but unlike his disciples 
              who demonised the evil-doer, Prabhupada treated him with compassion.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#11">11</a> 
              As we shall see, this is often a distinguishing feature in the way 
              Prabhupada and his disciples handled similar challenges. 
            <p>In fact, the challenges faced first by Prabhupada and later by 
              his disciples are so strikingly similar that they appear to be mirror 
              images of each other, logically suggesting a treatment in consonance 
              with their inherent congruence. They fall within two broad categories: 
              the problem of a) authority of the leadership, and b) continuity 
              of the tradition. These are the two crucial problems every founded 
              religion must solve if it wishes to preserve its identity over time, 
              particularly after the founder's departure. We shall look at four 
              'heresies' of authority, the first two as they arose while the founder 
              was still alive, showing how he met these challenges, then looking 
              at two 'heresies' of authority that arose after the founder's departure, 
              showing how his disciples met and are meeting these challenges. 
              We will then treat four heresies of continuity following the same 
              scheme-first during the founder's time, then during the period of 
              his disciples. But before we begin, a brief caveat for ISKCON readers. 
            <p>Heresies polarise. But divisiveness is not necessarily bad. The 
              disruptive beliefs and actions of contentious persons can also be 
              stimulants, forcing the institution and its leaders to define and 
              defend itself. Exploring heresy can provide insights into doctrinal 
              and institutional issues that other methods might not so easily 
              reveal. The study of heresies, therefore, is important for more 
              than antiquarian reasons. A religious tradition should pay attention 
              to heresies not merely to guard against the errors of the past (and 
              certainly not to demonise their advocates) but to learn from them. 
              Every heresy is a warning of unresolved tensions within a tradition 
              and a challenge to preserve the tradition in changing cultural and 
              intellectual circumstances. 
            <p><b>Heresies of Authority<br>
              The Guru is God Heresy<br>
              </b>There were lessons, undoubtedly, in the Kirtanananda episode 
              for Prabhupada as well as for his disciples. Upon his return to 
              America, he increased his translation output with the intention 
              of establishing the movement on a firm philosophical footing. At 
              the same time he began the formation of a body to govern his growing 
              institution.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#12">12</a> 
            <p>It may be recalled that after the departure of Prabhupada's guru, 
              the Gaudiya Matha splintered when Bhaktisiddhanta's senior disciples, 
              instead of following his instruction to govern collegially, attempted 
              to appoint a sole successor. Thirty years had elapsed and each leader 
              was now the head of his own institution. They had been silent when, 
              immediately after arriving in America, Prabhupada had sought their 
              help. Now, hearing of Prabhupada's success, they suggested he return 
              to India to discuss the most effective means to spread Chaitanya's 
              teachings. But Prabhupada was wary of their sudden interest in his 
              activities. 'Tell them,' he said, 'that I will only come if they 
              agree to form a governing body with twelve members. Since they have 
              never dared to leave India, they can collectively appoint one representative 
              and ISKCON shall make up the other eleven.' (Goswami, T. 1991:193) 
            <p>There was no reply. Instead, a veiled criticism of Prabhupada was 
              included in a letter to devotees in New York from Acyutananda dasa, 
              a disciple of Prabhupada who was living in one of the Indian Gaudiya 
              Mathas. Acyutananda dasa suggested that the title 'Prabhupada' ('he, 
              at whose feet all masters sit') should be reserved for Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati and Rupa Goswami (Sri Chaitanya's foremost disciple). 
              Always alert lest any harm befall his fledgling movement, Prabhupada 
              viewed his disciple's criticism as a spot of cancer which, if left 
              unchecked, would relativise his absolute position. He also noted 
              that the honorific 'His Divine Grace' and 'Prabhupada' had come 
              to be omitted from the cover of the most recent of his translations 
              released by ISKCON Press, Boston. Another publication merely described 
              him as '<i>acarya</i>', ('the institutional head') even though he 
              had instructed that the title 'founder-<i>acarya</i>' be included 
              in all his publications. 
            <p>To get a better sense of the distinction we need to explicate the 
              term <i>acarya.</i> 'One who teaches by example' (which may refer 
              to any genuine devotee) is the first definition. Another meaning 
              is 'one who grants initiation to a disciple,' - in other words, 
              a guru. Then there is a third meaning, 'the spiritual head of an 
              institution,' a title that may be given to future successors. But 
              the designation 'founder-<i> acarya</i>' is exclusive, inapplicable 
              to any other head of the institution other than its founder.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#13">13</a> 
              When Prabhupada objected to the omission of 'founder' before the 
              title '<i>acarya</i>,' he was obviously insisting on this last definition. 
            <p>Prabhupada detected similar challenges to his absolute authority 
              in the behaviour of certain leaders of his Los Angeles headquarters. 
              Increasingly, in the guise of protecting his privacy for his translating, 
              the leaders denied devotees direct access to him. In San Francisco 
              at the Festival of the Chariots, there was no seat for him on any 
              of the carts. Thus, he saw on a number of places moves to minimise 
              his position. With an adroitness which was characteristic of his 
              administrative skills, he acted suddenly to check this latest threat. 
              First, he awarded the renounced order of <i>sannyasa</i> to his 
              errant managers, commanding that they give up their administrative 
              roles in exchange for travelling and preaching. Simultaneously, 
              he appointed twelve of his most trusted disciples as members of 
              the first Governing Body Commission. As a final act, he announced 
              that despite his poor health and advanced age, he would himself 
              leave for establishing ISKCON's mission in India, the source of 
              the attack on his movement. 
            <p>But the cancer had not been checked. Halting in Japan en route 
              to India, Prabhupada learned that four of his new renunciants had 
              begun preaching a strange gospel. At a huge gathering of ISKCON 
              faithful at New Vrindaban on Krishna's birth anniversary, 1970, 
              they had announced that by leaving America, Prabhupada had rejected 
              his disciples for failing to recognise that Prabhupada was actually 
              Krishna Himself. This was nothing but another aspect of impersonalism. 
              While Kirtanananda had previously failed to distinguish between 
              the personal and impersonal conceptions of Godhead, the new <i>sannyasis</i> 
              had failed to distinguish the guru from the Godhead. Vaishnavas 
              teach that the guru is the servant of God, but never the Godhead 
              Himself. A Vaishnava spiritual master will never say that he is 
              God or that God is impersonal. 
            <p>In Japan, Prabhupada revealed the underlying implication: by making 
              him God, the seat of the guru was now vacated to make room for one 
              of his Gaudiya Matha godbrothers. He was, in effect, being picked 
              upstairs. He asked Sudama dasa and Tamal Krishna Goswami, the two 
              GBC representatives with him in Tokyo, what they intended to do. 
              In unison they responded that the four errant <i>sannyasis</i> should 
              be driven out of ISKCON. Prabhupada immediately agreed. 
            <p>The GBC members at the New Vrindavana festival had already begun 
              to expose the fallacious teachings of the four <i>sannyasis</i> 
              by citing numerous references from Prabhupada's books. But they 
              were surprised by the harsh edict that came from Japan. Nevertheless, 
              they carried out the order, relaying Prabhupada's instruction that 
              the <i>sannyasis</i> must now preach separately from the institution, 
              depending solely on Krishna for their support. Though penniless 
              and without institutional shelter, the forced independence appeared 
              to strengthen their connection with Prabhupada, and they headed 
              in different directions to carry out his order to preach. 
            <p>Prabhupada's stern response seems to indicate that he was prepared 
              to sacrifice a few individuals to save his Society from being seriously 
              infected with what he considered impersonalist poison. He did not, 
              however, reject the errant <i>sannyasis;</i> he had merely quarantined 
              them from other disciples to prevent further harm to his movement. 
              He continued to correspond with them and encouraged them to preach. 
              Gradually purified by the ordeal, each was eventually incorporated 
              back into ISKCON and went on to perform important service for the 
              Society. At the heart of this heresy is the challenge to Prabhupada's 
              authority. Elevating Prabhupada to the position of God cleared the 
              way for a successor, which in this case Prabhupada believed to be 
              one of his godbrothers. Because Prabhupada saw this as the real 
              threat, he may have been more severe in his response than when he 
              dealt with Kirtanananda. As long as the living authority is on earth, 
              he may adopt strategies that can seem inconsistent. Although he 
              never acts arbitrarily (he is guided by <i>sadhu</i> and <i>shastra</i> 
              - the precedents set by previous saintly persons and the injunctions 
              of scripture), time, place, and circumstances may influence his 
              decisions. Guru, <i>sadhu</i> and <i>shastra</i> check and balance 
              each other. But when the guru departs <i>sadhu</i> and <i>shastra</i> 
              can take on a new import, as those who succeed him become the new 
              interpreters of past precedents, scriptural law and new set of circumstances. 
            <p><b>The Centralisation Heresy<br>
              </b>Although the Governing Body Commission would eventually become 
              'the ultimate managing authority' of ISKCON (Goswami, S. 1983: Vol. 
              VI: 328-9) Prabhupada retained final authority in all matters during 
              his lifetime. Once in a while he vetoed the GBC's decisions, and 
              on one notable occasion he was forced to suspend its functioning 
              entirely. In March of 1972, without consulting Prabhupada, eight 
              of the twelve GBC members held a meeting in New York to centralise 
              ISKCON's management. The plan was to centralise control in the hands 
              of each zonal secretary by giving the GBC member complete control 
              over the temples' finances. All funds collected were to be sent 
              to a head office, which would then allot expenditures to each temple. 
              In a memo he issued to all ISKCON temple presidents, Prabhupada 
              referred to the 'big, big minutes' of the meeting in which they 
              had inducted one of his disciples, the chartered accountant Atreya 
              Risi dasa, as a new member and as secretary. The meeting had empowered 
              a management committee of two to act without Prabhupada's permission 
              and 'without divulging to the devotees.' (Prabhupada1987: 1956-7) 
            <p>&nbsp;This attempt at autonomy 'has upset my brain,' Prabhupada 
              wrote his temple presidents. He spelled out his alarm in capitals: 
              'I AUTHORISE YOU TO DISREGARD FOR THE TIME BEING ANY DECISION FROM 
              THE GBC MEN UNTIL MY FURTHER INSTRUCTION.' Seeking to establish 
              a direct link with each temple president, he urged that they manage 
              their temples' affairs 'peacefully and independently,' and inform 
              him of the names of their assistants. Finally, he repeated: 'ALL 
              GBC ORDERS ARE SUSPENDED HEREWITH BY ME UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.' 
            <p>In a further letter to Hamsaduta dasa, one of the illegitimate 
              meeting's organisers, Prabhupada pointed out how it was unconstitutional 
              (1987: 1958-9).<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#14">14</a> The seven 
              members in attendance may have constituted a quorum, but the meeting 
              had been convened without a general announcement to all twelve GBC 
              members. Prabhupada expressed surprise that none of the other GBC 
              members had detected this defect in the procedure. 'What will happen 
              when I am not here, shall everything be spoiled by GBC?' 
            <p>Prabhupada's concern seemed to focus on two issues. The first was 
              to avoid centralisation that would hamper each temple's development 
              by dampening their individual enthusiasm. In a letter dated 13, 
              October 1969, prior to the GBC's establishment, Prabhupada wrote 
              this writer (1987: 1054): 
            <ul>
              <p>I have seen the agenda of your presidents' meeting. This is nice. 
                One thing should be followed, however, as your countrymen are 
                more or less independent spirited and lovers of democracy. So 
                everything should be done very carefully so that their sentiments 
                may not be hurt, According to Sanskrit moral principles, everything 
                has to be acted, taking consideration of the place, audience and 
                time. As far as possible the centres should act freely, but conjointly. 
                They must look forward to the common development. 
            </ul>
            <p>Further instructions contained in a letter dated October 18 indicate 
              Prabhupada's concern to avoid centralisation, yet encourage organisation 
              (Goswami 1991: 189-97). 
            <p>A secondary concern was the undue stress on management and finances 
              that Prabhupada believed was not a solution to some of the problems 
              of spiritual laxity, but their cause. He described these problems 
              as (1) a failure to maintain neatness and cleanliness ('I still 
              see those who are initiated as brahmanas, they do not wash their 
              hand after eating even; of course, there may be so many defects 
              due to your births in non-brahmana families, but how long shall 
              it go on?'); (2) failure of all the members to chant sixteen rounds 
              daily; (3) failure at times to maintain the rigid schedule of temple 
              worship beginning at 4:00 a.m. ('I find that the devotees are still 
              sleeping up to six, seven o'clock.') (See letter to Hamsaduta, Prabhupada1987: 
              1958-9) 
            <p>A terse telegram from Prabhupada summarises his view: 'Your material 
              legal formula will not help us. Only our spiritual life can help 
              us.' (See telegrams to Hamsaduta, Karandhara and all temple presidents, 
              1987: 1954-5) 
            <p>Prabhupada called his GBC member for Western USA, Karandhara dasa, 
              to Tokyo to clearly establish the GBC's responsibilities. In a letter 
              issued by Karandhara, but bearing Prabhupada's signature of approval, 
              one can sense Prabhupada's authorship: 
            <ul>
              <p>The formula for ISKCON organisation is very simple and can be 
                understood by everyone. The world is divided into twelve zones. 
                For each zone there is one zonal secretary appointed by Srila 
                Prabhupada. The zonal secretary's duty is to see that the spiritual 
                principles are being upheld very nicely in all the temples of 
                the zone. Otherwise each temple shall be independent and self-supporting. 
                Let every temple president work according to his own capacity 
                to improve the Krishna consciousness of the centre. So far the 
                practical management is concerned, that is required, but not that 
                we should become too much absorbed in fancy organisation. Our 
                business is spiritual life, so whatever organisation needs to 
                be done, the presidents may handle and take advice and assistance 
                from their GBC representative. In this way let the Society's work 
                go on and everyone increase their service at their own creative 
                rate. (See letter to all temple presidents, Prabhupada1987: 1966-7) 
            </ul>
            <p>The failed attempt at centralisation did not mean that Prabhupada's 
              chosen leaders would cease jockeying for position and control, desires 
              that seem at the heart of each heresy. Indeed, every religion's 
              history is chequered with dark moments of ambition, in which personal 
              desire is seen as divine empowerment. Prabhupada's formula for preventing 
              such hegemony was to ensure each temple's autonomy within a loose-knit 
              framework supervised by the GBC. Local temples were to be financially 
              and legally autonomous though spiritually answerable to the GBC. 
              Yet in 1976 Prabhupada again encountered an attempt at centralisation, 
              this time under the prompting of lawyers who suggested that all 
              ISKCON temples in the United States should be sheltered under a 
              single 'umbrella corporation'. Prabhupada again stubbornly opposed 
              this, insisting that it would make all ISKCON temples vulnerable 
              to any litigation filed against one. Time proved Prabhupada's wisdom; 
              had ISKCON followed its legal advisors, it would have been bankrupted 
              by the anti-cult inspired court cases of the 1980s. 
            <p>By suspending the GBC temporarily, Prabhupada indicated that this 
              highest body was neither infallible nor autonomous. As long as he 
              was present, it was answerable to him, but in his absence how would 
              its mistakes be rectified? Ideally, it would correct itself, but 
              events following Prabhupada's departure proved otherwise. 
            <p><b> The Zonal Acarya Heresy<br>
              </b>The departure of ISKCON's charismatic founder traumatised the 
              Society's entire membership and, as might be expected, inaugurated 
              an extended struggle to resolve the issue of authority. His death 
              was not sudden, but followed a protracted illness lasting a year. 
              Though devotees had enough time to prepare themselves for the inevitable 
              conclusion, their total dependence upon Prabhupada left them deeply 
              shaken by his absence. The aftershocks were felt again and again, 
              individually and on ISKCON as a whole. Prabhupada had warned that 
              the <i>acarya's</i> departure is a great loss to the world; the 
              spiritual vacuum thus created would be the cause of havoc in his 
              institution, a view confirmed by the history of the Gaudiya Matha. 
              But despite such warnings, ISKCON's leaders acted hastily to fill 
              the void created by Prabhupada's departure. No doubt they were motivated 
              by one of Prabhupada's final requests that they at least maintain 
              what he had left them. Yet immaturity and, on the part of some, 
              desire and ambition, led to the establishment of a zonal <i>acarya</i> 
              system in the 1980s which threatened to leave ISKCON as divided 
              as the Gaudiya Matha. The eighties decade also saw attempts to bring 
              into ISKCON <i>acaryas</i> from outside Gaudiya groups. It also 
              saw the proposal that since none of Prabhupada's disciples was qualified 
              to serve as guru, Prabhupada himself would continue to initiate 
              posthumously (the <i>ritvik-acarya</i> theory). 
            <p>The GBC was in place to oversee the functioning of ISKCON. Yet 
              how was this 'ultimate managing authority' to be harmonised with 
              the position of the initiating guru, particularly as the role of 
              the guru had become institutionalised in ISKCON after Prabhupada's 
              departure? Ravindra Svarupa frames the issue for us 'The problem 
              arose when the conception of guru was implicitly based on the traditional 
              model of an inspired, charismatic, spiritual autocrat, an absolute 
              and autonomously decisive authority, around who an institution takes 
              shape as the natural extension and embodiment of his charisma.' 
              (dasa, R. 1994: 43) This echoes Shinn's remarks, following the views 
              of Max Weber: 'Consequently, if the movement begun by such a charismatic 
              figure is to continue, the charisma must somehow be 'routinised' 
              or transferred to surviving institutional rules or structures.' 
              (Shinn 1987: 50) 
            <p>Prabhupada prepared for such routinisation by creating the GBC. 
              'The practical problem facing ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's demise 
              was this: How do gurus, who are God's direct representatives and 
              according to fundamental Vaishnava theology to be worshipped by 
              their disciples 'on an equal level with God,' fit within an organisation 
              functioning through modern rational and legal modes under the direction 
              of a committee?' (dasa, R. 1994: 25) 
            <p>In their first annual meeting held after Prabhupada's demise in 
              the spring of 1978 in Mayapur, West Bengal, the GBC decided to consult 
              Prabhupada's respected and closest godbrother B. R. Sridhara Maharaja 
              to help resolve this dilemma. But in the Gaudiya Matha, Sridhara 
              Maharaja himself had been prominent among those advocating a successor 
              <i>acarya</i> instead of the GBC that Bhaktisiddhanta had ordered 
              after his own guru's demise. Now the <i>acarya</i> at the head of 
              his own institution, he recommended that ISKCON gurus must be similarly 
              absolute: 
            <ul>
              <p>The majority (of the GBC) are non-<i>acarya</i> (non-guru). According 
                to my opinion, that will create a difficulty. In our system, both 
                autocracy and democracy cannot go together. But ours is an autocratic 
                thing, extremely autocratic. Guru is all in all. Our submission 
                to guru is unconditional. This is a great difficulty. Submission 
                to guru is unconditional. So when I (as a disciple) see my guru's 
                powers are being pressed by other Vaishnavas it will create disturbance 
                in the mind of the <i>shishya</i> (disciple), to grow his <i>shraddha, 
                </i> faith, absolute faith... It is better that the members of 
                the governing body be gurus. They are all <i>acaryas.</i> The 
                assembly of <i>acaryas</i> will consult with one another. (See 
                Rochford 1991: 223) 
            </ul>
            <p>Six months before his own demise, Prabhupada had announced that 
              he would appoint some of his disciples to perform all of the functions 
              of initiating new disciples, as he had become too ill to do so. 
              Those so initiated would still be Prabhupada's disciples, while 
              those who would be initiated after his demise would become his grand-disciples. 
              Shortly thereafter, Prabhupada selected eleven disciples to begin 
              assisting him and asked his secretary to communicate their names 
              to the rest of ISKCON.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#15">15</a> 
            <p>Following Prabhupada's death and the fateful meeting with Prabhupada's 
              godbrother Sridhara Maharaja, the eleven gurus named by Prabhupada 
              assumed an extraordinary position above all others including the 
              non-guru GBC members. Even within the GBC, they established their 
              own Guru Board to appoint new gurus and handle guru problems. In 
              the temples their status was elevated practically equal to Prabhupada's. 
              They accepted honorific titles, were given elevated seats and were 
              worshipped in the same manner accorded previously to Prabhupada. 
              Each was allocated his own exclusive geographical area in which 
              to initiate-his own GBC zone and that of any other non-guru GBC 
              willing to align with him. Since all the new recruits soon became 
              his disciples, each guru exercised an increasing influence over 
              not only the devotees within his own GBC zone, but any other zone 
              of which he was the initiating guru. Thus, for all purposes he became 
              the zonal <i>acarya,</i> the head of the institution (or at least 
              a significant geographical portion of the institution). 
            <p>As Ravindra Svarupa notes, 'The guru zones were more unified than 
              ISKCON as a whole, which was becoming increasingly fragmented, turning 
              into a kind of amphictyony of independently empowered leaders.' 
              (dasa, R. 1994: 31) While disciples of the new gurus found nothing 
              strange in this new arrangement, disciples of Prabhupada who were 
              not gurus became increasingly alarmed. In Pradyumna dasa's prophetic 
              letter written just after the changes were set in place, he expresses 
              his concerns in two ways. First, that the eleven gurus not having 
              been appointed to the position of acarya and for which they are 
              unqualified both by a) insufficient knowledge of shastra (scripture) 
              and b) the incomplete realisation of Krishna Consciousness, are 
              accepting worship on that level-and this may lead to anomalies in 
              the Society and personally, because of lack of complete detachment 
              in atma-jnana (knowledge of the self), to have build-up of pride, 
              and subsequent fall-down. Secondly, that the united society ISKCON, 
              because of a legal division and control by a few members instead 
              of the joint GBC will become broken up in separate societies and 
              the unified preaching effort very much hindered. (See, dasa, R. 
              S. 1985b) 
            <p>An exodus of Prabhupada's disciples followed. Within only a few 
              years of his departure, a majority of Prabhupada's disciples ceased 
              to actively participate in ISKCON.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#16">16</a> 
            <p> Faith in the gurus and in the institution as a whole was severely 
              shaken when the GBC had to censure three of the eleven gurus for 
              varying degrees of misconduct. Jayatirtha dasa was found to be taking 
              'LSD' and was guilty of sexual transgressions. Hamsaduta Swami, 
              in a much publicised case, was discovered amassing weapons, and 
              was also found to be sexually promiscuous. Tamal Krishna Goswami, 
              the leader of a large number of <i>sannyasa</i> and <i>brahmacari</i> 
              preachers, insisted that he was now their via media in relating 
              to Prabhupada and expected that his godbrothers follow him absolutely. 
              Furthermore, he temporarily engaged them in raising funds for community 
              development rather than allowing them to continue the service of 
              book selling, the principal missionary directive they had received 
              from Prabhupada. The GBC suspended the initiating rights of all 
              three gurus. But when on the advice of Prabhupada's godbrother Sridhara 
              Maharaja, the sanctions came to be lifted surprisingly soon, it 
              seemed that individual gurus had become stronger than the collective 
              GBC. At the same time, Sridhara Maharaja's influence continued to 
              increase as a number of prominent ISKCON leaders including Jayatirtha 
              defected to join his camp. The defectees claimed that Sridhara Maharaja, 
              due to his exalted qualifications, was clearly Prabhupada's successor. 
            <p>As Rochford has rightly pointed out, Sridhara Maharaja, perhaps 
              unwittingly at first, became a political symbol for growing discontent 
              with the ISKCON management system. (Rochford, 1985: 247) Surrounded 
              by dissidents, Sridhara Maharaja's criticism of the GBC increased, 
              and he also raised the questions about certain decisions and actions 
              of Prabhupada. This seemed to confirm to ISKCON leaders what they 
              had previously learned from Prabhupada: it was best to keep away 
              from the Gaudiya Matha. Wary of further contact, the GBC entirely 
              separated themselves from Sridhara Maharaja.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#17">17</a> 
            <p>But this did not remedy the unhappy state of affairs within ISKCON. 
              Divisiveness due to zonal <i>acarya</i> hegemony continued to increase 
              until the leading non-GBC disciples of Prabhupada, many of them 
              temple presidents in North America, expressed their collective outrage. 
              By the end of 1984 they launched what came to be known as the 'guru 
              reform movement,' culminating in the fateful meeting at the New 
              Vrindavana community attended by all GBC and temple presidents and 
              open to all Prabhupada disciples. This cathartic gathering, which 
              had begun from a groundswell of discontent, gained such momentum 
              that it eventually swept away the entire zonal <i>acarya</i> system. 
              At the next annual GBC meeting in the spring of 1987, the number 
              of ISKCON gurus was more than doubled and the number of GBC men 
              significantly increased to include some of the prominent leaders 
              of the guru reform movement.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#18">18</a> 
              Gurus were now free to initiate in any zone.<a

 href="5_1perilsfoot.html#19">19</a> Most significantly, each guru was clearly 
              made to understand that his authority was tied to the GBC, thus 
              re-establishing Prabhupada, through the GBC, as the head of ISKCON. 
            <p>The stormy decade following Prabhupada's demise left many casualties 
              in its wake: perhaps as many as 90% of Prabhupada's initiated disciples 
              were now marginalised; disciples of fallen gurus felt they had no 
              shelter; the preaching mission as a whole lost momentum and cohesion. 
              ISKCON was battered and bruised-but it had survived. Important lessons 
              had been learned. One was that Prabhupada's position was unique 
              and not to be imitated. His status was not due merely to being ISKCON's 
              founder, but to his exalted level of Krishna consciousness. The 
              status of GBC, gurus, and other leaders, on the other hand, was 
              as much a matter of inheritance as personal qualification. But reliance 
              on such inherited status, without a continued effort to become actually 
              qualified, would prove to be but a thin veneer of spirituality. 
              Knowing devotees to be fallible, Prabhupada had purposely named 
              no single successor, but instead had designated the GBC as the ultimate 
              managing authority for ISKCON.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#20">20</a> 
              In doing so, Prabhupada forbade any single person, no matter how 
              exalted, to try to imitate his position. Rather, all were enjoined 
              to 'follow in his footsteps.' 
            <p>The GBC emerged from the zonal <i>acarya</i> decade a tougher, 
              more honest, and thoroughly collegial body. No longer did individuals 
              fighting for turf dominate it. Gurus with large followings sat on 
              an equal level with non-guru godbrothers. And they were not the 
              only ones to be humbled. The GBC itself, the 'ultimate managing 
              authority,' had seen its own authority collapse, only to be resurrected 
              by a 'lower house' of temple presidents. Assuming extraordinary 
              powers, the temple presidents had made the GBC submit itself to 
              the judgement of its own appointed committee of 50 non-GBC godbrothers, 
              thus in effect temporarily suspending itself, something that only 
              Prabhupada while alive could have done. This action put the GBC 
              and everyone in ISKCON on notice that no individual or group was 
              beyond scrutiny. Even 'ultimate authorities' have limits. As Shinn 
              notes shortly after the momentous meetings of 1986 and 1987, 'the 
              impressive fact for any careful observer of ISKCON's history is 
              that it has been able to evolve in a very short time from a charismatic 
              movement to a relatively stable institution in the face of a hostile 
              external environment and a volatile governing structure within.'
