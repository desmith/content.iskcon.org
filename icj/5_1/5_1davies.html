            <p> 
            <p><i>I have spent most of my life being educated or educating, yet 
              at seventy years old I am still discovering new aspects of education 
              that surprise and delight me. My experience ranges in time, from 
              my own childhood in economically depressed South Wales in the nineteen 
              thirties, through more affluent but turbulent social conditions 
              in the fifties and sixties to the market economy strictures of modern 
              state interventionism. It also ranges hierarchically from Primary 
              school through Secondary school to Technical Colleges and Universities. 
              I have worked in some of the most prestigious and technologically 
              advanced universities in the Western world but also in the most 
              basic conditions in Asia, Africa and Central America, where a school 
              sometimes consists of a tree to provide shade with equipment limited 
              to boards on which to write with a sharpened stick for a pen and 
              mud for ink. As a result, I believed I knew what education was about. 
              Then I was asked to help a Hare Krishna group formulate its ideas 
              and plans for revising its own education provision, and I entered 
              a new world, where many of my own, and most other people's, beliefs 
              about education were invalid. In this article, I would like to explore 
              some of these issues and relate them to the practicalities of education. 
              I wish, however, to make clear that I believe the process of education 
              to be objective, and my remarks are not intended to indicate support 
              for the aims of any particular ideology, including ISKCON's.</i> 
            <p>Education is inevitable because we are genetically programmed to 
              learn. What we generally mean by education therefore is an organised 
              system of controlling this natural process, and the nature and aims 
              of such a system are a major concern of all social groups. Whatever 
              these aims, however, I doubt whether many would disagree that education 
              is an enabling process which allows or causes people to change, 
              and that, if there is no change there has been no education. Disagreement 
              is, however, likely to be considerable about what change should 
              occur and therefore, what form the process should take. 
            <p>To many, the process is primarily one of 'putting in', to others 
              of 'drawing out'. The extreme case of putting in is that of <i>indoctrination,</i> 
              where an educator wishes to implant a fixed set of ideas or beliefs 
              and <i>to exclude the possibility of contrary ideas being considered 
              and accepted.</i> This process has dominated many totalitarian political 
              regimes and some religious organisations. By comparison, the extreme 
              form of drawing-out is a 'laissez faire' approach where the student 
              is given access to a totally random range of ideas and knowledge 
              and left to derive what he or she can from it with no intervention 
              from others. Between these extremes there is, of course, a continuum 
              of processes combining various degrees of prescription and freedom. 
            <p>We cannot <i>not</i> educate! Every action we observe in others 
              influences us, and this non-formal education is probably the most 
              powerful of all, particularly when we are very young, when much 
              learning is unconscious and unselective, that is, it is <i>intrajected,</i> 
              or 'swallowed whole'. Such intrajection influences our later beliefs 
              and behaviour even though we may have lost awareness of it, and 
              accounts for much prejudice and other irrational behaviour. However, 
              we have little control over learning of this kind, since we are 
              often unaware how our actions affect others. We can, of course, 
              choose to behave in 'good' ,<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#1">1</a> 
              rather than 'bad' ways; and this is the basis for much of the <i>inferential,</i> 
              or <i>imitative</i> education advocated by Prabhupada and of the 
              social education which occurs through interaction of individuals 
              with their peers. However, a great deal of our education, particularly 
              of our intellect, is formal, that is, it is planned and is implemented 
              in controlled environments, like schools. 
            <p>Formal education is socially determined and is a major means of 
              achieving a group's desired outcomes of political and moral philosophy, 
              economic doctrine or social cohesion. These outcomes collectively 
              determine the group's vision of what sort of society it wishes to 
              have: democracy or dictatorship, free enterprise economy or state 
              controlled, theocratic or lay; these are just a few examples. All 
              groups need to be clear what they are educating for, therefore, 
              and to shape their education system accordingly. So, what does ISKCON 
              want from its education system? The limited literature I have read 
              suggests that it is strongly influenced by ideas and values emanating 
              from India, which is understandable, given Prabhupada's background, 
              but is it not now appropriate to implement the Vedic principle that 
              education should be appropriate to the time and place in which it 
              is practised, and to develop a set of guiding principles which are 
              congruent with Hare Krishna beliefs, and therefore universally applicable, 
              but which can be fashioned to the particular needs of local culture? 
            <p><b>Education in and for ISKCON<br>
              </b><i>Author's note: Although I have taken an interest in and worked 
              within ISKCON, and have consulted extensively about its education 
              programmes, I am not a devotee, so that the observations which follow 
              may not fully represent the Society's beliefs and aims. Any faults 
              result from ignorance, not design, and I hope my readers will be 
              charitable towards them.</i> 
            <p>To be successful, ISKCON education must reflect its purpose. This 
              is, as I understand, it to help people, both in and outside the 
              movement, to understand and practise Krishna consciousness, so that 
              success will be measurable in the degree to which the general public 
              understand and are sympathetic to it and in the degree to which 
              members understand and can communicate its principles and beliefs. 
            <p>The recipients of this education will, therefore, be: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>the general public</li>
              <li> devotees wishing to further their knowledge and understanding 
                of its principles</li>
              <li>the children of devotees</li>
              <li>devotees needing to be trained to teach their fellow devotees</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and the curriculum<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#2">2</a> for each 
              cohort must suit its specific needs, that is, that which has the 
              appropriate <i>content</i> and <i> process</i> to achieve the desired 
              outcomes, which I understand to be that, after completion of the 
              curriculum, recipients will: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li> understand the principles and practices of Krishna consciousness</li>
              <li>be able to think for themselves, so as to use intelligently 
                and build on the knowledge they have acquired</li>
              <li>possess management skills enabling them to contribute fully 
                to ISKCON in their immediate community and the wider world</li>
              <li>develop practical skills, such as gardening or cookery, valuable 
                to the welfare of their community</li>
              <li>develop intrapersonal and interpersonal skills which lead to 
                fulfilling and harmonious lives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These outcomes concern <i>knowledge</i> and <i>skills,</i> both 
              of which are important but require different learning strategies: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li><i>knowledge acquisition</i>, that is, familiarity with the 
                scriptures and the teachings of Krishna consciousness, is about 
                obtaining information and remembering it. In its simplest forms 
                it can be achieved from direct observation, from books and by 
                word of mouth, for example, from teachers. It is largely controlled 
                for example by authors, teachers, etc, since they select and interpret 
                the facts they convey. Knowledge by itself has very limited value, 
                however, without skills of analysis, organisation and application.</li>
              <li><i> skill acquisition</i> requires more active learner involvement, 
                since skills can only be acquired through personal practice and 
                not from someone else, although the learner may seek the help 
                of others who already possess them. It is important to remember 
                that skills provide the practitioner with a culturally and morally 
                neutral technology, that is, its effects vary according to his 
                or her motives and attitudes. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>SKILLS are acquired through personal experience of <i>doing,</i> 
              as illustrated in the diagram below, which shows a behavioural, 
              continuous and cumulative process with the following sequence:<br>
              DOING means undergoing a concrete experience. Let us use learning 
              to play the piano as an illustrative example. I cannot learn to 
              play the piano without playing the piano! I can read all the books 
              there are, and attend every lecture on piano-playing, but I will 
              never be able to play. So, <i>ab initio</i>, I must <i>DO!<br>
              </i>REFLECTION means reviewing and thinking about what happened. 
              So, in trying to play the piano I make a horrible noise. I am now 
              aware of the need to change. But how?<br>
              ABSTRACTION. At this stage I analyse why I produced horrible noise 
              instead of sweet melodies but realise I need help to make this analysis, 
              so I ask advice, and am told what I was doing wrong.<br>
              MODIFICATION. With this advice in mind I think I know how I might 
              improve my playing, so I play again, but this time differently and 
              hopefully with some improvement. By repeating this cycle, I should 
              continue to improve until I have acquired the skill of piano-playing. 
            <p>Just as I will never learn to play the piano by listening to lectures 
              or reading books, so I will not learn to think analytically, to 
              manage affairs, to engage in interpersonal interaction and so on, 
              without <i>doing</i> these things, <i>making mistakes, learning 
              from them </i>and<i> repeating the process</i>. Experiential learning 
              is powerful - it is for example, how I learned to walk, to read, 
              to write, to live (relatively) harmoniously with my fellow beings. 
            <p>Young children learn most readily in this way because they do not 
              yet have the maturity to abstract from information. They need, therefore, 
              to develop <i>concepts,</i> or <i>abstractions;</i> for example, 
              they will have no understanding of the word 'transport', but can 
              gain it if they become familiar with for example, cars, lorries, 
              trains-that is, from concrete examples. To try to teach young children 
              abstract ideas about Krishna consciousness will, therefore, almost 
              certainly be ineffective. They need to learn experientially through 
              direct contact with nature, religious practices and so on, and from 
              mimicking the behavioural models of their elders and peers. As they 
              mature they will make the abstractions which constitute religious 
              belief. Most adults also need experiential stimuli to promote their 
              learning and to achieve the 'ah-hah' <a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#3">3</a> 
              moments when intrajected knowledge finally makes sense and become 
              internalised into behaviour.

            <p>My experience of ISKCON education, which is admittedly limited, 
              suggests that there is a strong focus on knowledge acquisition, 
              with the teacher rather than the learner as the central protagonist, 
              and passive attendance at lectures rather than experiential learning 
              as the dominant process. Such emphases remind me of my experience 
              in developing nations where schools are strongly teacher-centred 
              and preoccupied with teaching, rather than learning; with discipline, 
              rather than self-discipline; with knowledge-transmission, rather 
              than skills-acquisition; and with little recognition of the need 
              to adjust methodology to the maturity and varying needs of the learner 
              . There is, I know, a move towards change, with excellent work being 
              done in England and Ireland<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#4">4</a> 
              (and possibly elsewhere), but understand that many areas still promote 
              more traditional methods. In fact, a central textbook on education 
              advocates a strongly teacher-centred approach with an emphasis on 
              the mechanics of teaching and knowledge transmission in which lecturing 
              is seen as a principal mode of teaching children.<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#5">5</a> 
              I firmly believe that the central concern of education should be 
              that the student learns, rather than the teacher teaches, and that 
              learning comes from within and cannot be imposed by the teacher: 
              <i>unless I decide to learn, you cannot teach me</i>. In saying 
              this, I am not saying that teaching is unnecessary; merely that 
              <i>it should not interfere with learning</i>. 
            <p>I believe that education should: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li><i>use methods appropriate to the learner.</i> Children do not 
                have the capacity to learn like adults and require approaches 
                which will enable them to develop abstract ideas from concrete 
                experience. Similarly, all adults do not have the same intellectual 
                gifts and need to be approached differently.</li>
              <li><i>use all the learner's available senses.</i> People have different 
                ways of perceiving and remembering, for example, I am strongly 
                visual and kinaesthetic, which means that I am more likely to 
                learn through pictures and through my emotions than through sound; 
                that is why I find lectures unstimulating and dry facts dry! During 
                a project I led in Pakistan,<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#6">6</a> 
                merely introducing simple visual aids into classrooms had an immediate 
                impact on the quality of learning, and when teachers added tactile 
                experiences, for example, in organising 'hands-on' science lessons, 
                the gain was further increased. The more varied the experience 
                of the learner, the more readily he or she learns.</li>
              <li><i>give learners ownership of the learning process</i> by involving 
                them in participative activities. With more mature students this 
                can extend to the negotiation of learning contracts, where they 
                identify their particular learning needs and cooperate with the 
                teacher in planning strategies for meeting them; very young children 
                can similarly take responsibility for their own learning, as in 
                'Highscope'<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#7">7</a> and similar projects.</li>
              <li><i>develop skills as well as transmitting knowledge. </i>Knowledge 
                is of limited value unless it is used, and using knowledge requires 
                skills, such as analysis or decision-making. Unless ISKCON wishes 
                merely to dictate to its members, which I doubt, it needs to build 
                the development of such skills into its education system, so that 
                the movement can develop and build on the foundations given to 
                it by Prabhupada. <i>Skills cannot be taught</i> - they need to 
                be learned experientially, and are most naturally developed through 
                facing up to challenges individually or through interaction with 
                others, so that the use of group and individual problem-solving 
                assignments needs to be part of any learning programme. Other 
                techniques, such as in-tray exercises and simulations,<a href="5_1daviesfoot.html#8">8</a> 
                also encourage such skills. The basic unit of such education is 
                the <i>workshop</i> (a place where people <i>do</i>), rather than 
                the <i>class</i> (where people have things <i>done for them</i>), 
                and the person responsible for organising is more of a <i>facilitator</i> 
                than a teacher. The use of workshops is now central to most management 
                training, an aspect of education which ISKCON, I know, wishes 
                to develop.</li>
              <li><i>be organised by qualified practitioners.</i> Effective teaching 
                requires knowledge of how learning occurs and how best to stimulate 
                and nurture it, and skills in planning, organising and evaluating 
                the process. To entrust this to anyone who happens to be interested 
                in education would be foolhardy. This is not, of course, to say 
                that the interest and enthusiasm of untrained members cannot be 
                utilised; but their efforts need to be directed by qualified teachers, 
                or else they need to be trained. I am aware that much of the educational 
                policy-making and implementation within ISKCON have, hitherto, 
                been undertaken by people undoubtedly wise and knowledgeable about 
                the philosophy and practices of Krishna consciousness but who 
                know very little about education. I would, therefore, advocate: 
              </li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>identifying specialist teachers within the movement and entrusting 
                  them with organising its education programmes</li>
                <li>creating systems to ensure coordination of the efforts of 
                  such teachers, possibly by an international 'staff college'</li>
                <li> establishing training programmes for those who wish to assist 
                  the specialists, bearing in mind that training trainers is in 
                  itself a specialist field, requiring different methods from 
                  teaching students.<br>
                  &nbsp;</li>
              </ol>
              <li>ISKCON needs to plan and manage its educational provision so 
                as to optimise the use of its resources. While it is advisable 
                to allow regional choice in how this is done, there is a need 
                for support systems which might have the following characteristics:</li>
              <li> an international office for the coordination of educational 
                effort around the globe. Its functions would be: </li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>to define the vision and desired outcomes of the education 
                  process</li>
                <li>to design an integrated curriculum incorporating the essential 
                  princples of Krishna consciousness which need to be communicated 
                  to students</li>
                <li>to support national and regional initiatives in delivering 
                  the curriculum without directing a particular ethos or process. 
                  It is important to preserve the flexibility of decision-making 
                  which stimulates creativity and experimentationto disseminate 
                  information about educational matters and developments, including 
                  examples of successful practice. This might be through an educational 
                  journal along the lines of the current successful communications 
                  journal</li>
                <li>to develop an integrated curriculum for teacher training, 
                  possibly using outside experts to advise on appropriate methodology</li>
                <li>to set standards for teacher competence and to establish procedures 
                  for accrediting teacher competency</li>
                <li>to establish national educational offices which would coordinate 
                  the work of individual temples and groups involved in educational 
                  projects. Again, it is important that such offices should not 
                  dictate practice, but should support local initiatives, coordinate 
                  the development of resources and disseminate good practice.</li>
                <li>to establish regional centres for teacher training under the 
                  auspices of the international office. These centres could be 
                  developed as staff colleges for the provision of conferences, 
                  workshops, in-service training and general advice to serving 
                  teachers.</li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
            <p><i>These, are some of my ideas for the development of education 
              within ISKCON. They are entirely personal, possibly idiosyncratic, 
              but intended to be helpful. </i>
