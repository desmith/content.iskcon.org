            <p><b>The Proxy-Initiation Heresy<br>
              </b>While the entire GBC and vast majority of ISKCON devotees are 
              today united in support of their gurus, the gurus' credibility and 
              even their legitimacy continues to be debated by the very large 
              community of marginalised devotees. As the GBC labours to inherit 
              Prabhupada's managerial mantle, individual gurus struggle to bear 
              the weight of guruship. The founder's authority as (1) administrative 
              head and (2) as initiator of new disciples must both be transferred 
              for the routinisation of his charisma to be complete. But the first 
              may be easier than the second, for the insufficiencies of managerial 
              authority, especially when it functions collegially as the GBC does, 
              are more easily forgiven than the transgressions of a guru who, 
              by definition, is the via media to God. Scripture enjoins that he 
              be worshipped as 'the supreme personality of servitor Godhead' (Prabhupada1974: 
              <i>Adi-lila</i>, 1.46 Purport), a vision difficult to maintain in 
              the wake of various guru scandals. ISKCON gurus may insist on the 
              full faith of their disciples even as Prabhupada did. But whereas 
              Prabhupada could boldly defend himself against his godbrothers' 
              criticism, present gurus cannot so easily dismiss the criticism 
              that arises if they fail to perfectly represent Prabhupada and Krishna. 
              Indeed, it is not entirely uncommon for disciples of the ISKCON 
              gurus to repose their faith primarily in Prabhupada, something quite 
              unthinkable with regard to Prabhupada's disciples and Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati Prabhupada once corrected his servant for 'jumping over 
              the spiritual master' to pray directly to Bhaktisiddhanta (Goswami, 
              T. K. 1984: 245). But now, new converts are trained to first accept 
              Prabhupada's shelter exclusively for at least six months before 
              being advised to select that initiating guru who reminds them most 
              of Prabhupada. In fact, Prabhupada is more widely available now 
              than ever before (through audio, video, print and electronic reproduction). 
              Thus, the statement, 'I see my Spiritual Master as Prabhupada's 
              associate and so for that reason I also feel great attachment and 
              respect for him' (Rochford, 1997), coming from a new disciple, might 
              not be considered unfaithful. And the following, written by an aspiring 
              initiate after learning that the guru of his choice had recently 
              renounced his duties, becomes entirely understandable: 
            <ul>
              <p>&nbsp;After building a relation with 'X' Maharaja on a guru/disciple 
                relation and then receiving the fax of the bad news, it really 
                hits hard. Now I can see why some devotees lose faith in ISKCON 
                <i>sannyasis.</i> You have to realise that Srila Prabhupada is 
                our true guru and that his instructions are always there for us 
                to fall back on. After all, he is our acarya, our master. I owe 
                everything I have and everything I will have in Krishna consciousness 
                to Srila Prabhupada for saving me from this material world of 
                repeated birth and death.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#21">21</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> Such comments are not rare. Yet, interestingly, these poignant 
              remarks prefaced a request that Tamal Krishna Goswami accept the 
              aspirant as a disciple and award him initiation in the future. They 
              are not written by one who believes that initiation from a present 
              ISKCON guru is unimportant. Similar letters requesting re-initiation 
              are also received from initiates whose gurus have fallen. Both bear 
              out what scripture affirms: without the mercy of the spiritual master 
              one cannot make spiritual advancement. 
            <p>But is this really so? Is the devotion of the uninitiated fruitless? 
              And having been initiated, if one's guru falls, is all one's devotion 
              worthless? And what is the connection between the guru's own level 
              of advancement and the potential advancement of his disciple? These 
              questions, with only slight adjustments in terminology, are at the 
              heart of every founded religion. To cite but one example, the Christian 
              Church under Augustine's guidance rejected as heretical the Donatists' 
              assertion that the flawed character of a priest invalidated the 
              sacrament he administered. And, some eight hundred years later, 
              Aquinas invoked sacerdotalism to establish the via media of the 
              priesthood. Nor are such issues new to Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which 
              emphasises the centrality of the guru's role in the salvation of 
              the disciple with the same fervour it argues for the existence of 
              the Godhead. Although elevating the guru to a place beside the Godhead, 
              Gaudiya Vaishnava doctrine makes provisions in case he falls. In 
              centuries past, <i>acaryas</i> like Bhaktivinoda and Narahari Cakravarti 
              gave guidelines for rejecting a fallen guru and accepting re-initiation. 
              Guru scandals and controversies, it seems, have besmirched the hallowed 
              sanctuary of religion since long ago. 
            <p>While it is beyond our present purpose to delve into all the above 
              questions, one particular debate has engaged many both within and 
              on the margins of ISKCON. Must a devotee, not yet initiated, accept 
              a living breathing guru if he or she is to make full spiritual advancement? 
              Responding to this question in the North American Prabhupada Centennial 
              Survey, a considerable majority (86%) of full-time ISKCON members 
              responded affirmatively, as compared with just over half (52%) of 
              those no longer active in ISKCON (Rochford, 1997). Those who responded 
              negatively were not questioning the need for a guru. Rather, they 
              probably had in mind the notion that Prabhupada can continue to 
              initiate disciples even after his demise. This view, known until 
              recently as the <i>ritvik acarya</i> theory,<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#22">22</a> 
              claims that Prabhupada appointed <i>ritviks</i> (priests initiating 
              on behalf of Prabhupada) as proxies without intending that any of 
              his disciples become regular gurus. Adherents of this philosophy 
              believe that Prabhupada was and continues to be the only legitimate 
              guru for ISKCON. According to the same survey, nearly a quarter 
              (23%) of ISKCON's full-time members, and some of less than half 
              (45%) of those devotees no longer active in ISKCON agreed that Prabhupada 
              wanted those he named to continue as proxy-initiators after his 
              departure. (Rochford, 1997) This is not an insignificant number 
              when one considers the extent of GBC efforts to refute and prescribe 
              this view. 
            <p>Considering the enormous importance the tradition invests in the 
              guru, it is no wonder the issue has sparked such heated debate. 
              The 'appointment' conversations and correspondence of Prabhupada 
              in the year prior to his demise are sufficiently elliptical to allow 
              various interpretations. Guru improprieties that surfaced in the 
              1980s were a confirmation for some that the gurus should be at best 
              no more than proxies. Prabhupada was the actual guru, they argued, 
              and they presented their interpretation of his statements as the 
              warrants to prove their case. But the GBC gave these statements 
              an entirely different reading, one that was firmly in keeping with 
              the traditional understanding of the principle of disciplic succession, 
              a principle enunciated throughout Prabhupada's teachings. 
            <p>Proxy-initiation proponents established their own community, New 
              Jaipur, in Louisiana and published the <i>Vedic Village Review</i> 
              to propagate their philosophy. They have also conducted initiations 
              in which new recruits are deemed to be Prabhupada's own disciples, 
              although there have only been a few such ceremonies. Ironically, 
              the community and <i>Review</i> were both closed due to the moral 
              and legal transgressions of their organisers, survived only by the 
              proxy-initiation cause itself, which has since attracted new champions. 
            <p>The GBC has been far from silent on this issue. They devoted the 
              entire first issue of the ISKCON Journal - seventeen essays, interviews 
              and testimonies in all - to exposing the proxy-initiation fallacy. 
              That same year (1990) the publisher and editors of the <i>Vedic 
              Village Review</i> were excommunicated for continuing to actively 
              promote their views despite repeated warnings. In 1995, the GBC 
              published the 51-page <i>Gurus and Initiation in ISKCON</i>, a compilation 
              of all the relevant ISKCON laws and official papers on the subject 
              (GBC 1995). Nor did that conclude the matter. Fresh legislation 
              in 1996 states, 'Temple presidents, at their discretion, have the 
              right to prohibit its [proxy-initiation] advocates from participating 
              in ISKCON functions or visiting an ISKCON temple if their advocacy 
              creates a disturbance.'<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#23">23</a> Various 
              ISKCON leaders have individually published papers against the proxy-initiation 
              philosophy. Some, like Jayadvaita Swami (Swami, J., 1996a), have 
              conceded that the proxy-initiation people are right on certain non-philosophical 
              points. But the proxy-initiation people are in no way satisfied 
              with such minor concessions. They remain solid in their conviction 
              that the present ISKCON guru system is fundamentally flawed. Their 
              most recent outpouring, an 87-page position paper entitled <i>The 
              Controversy Surrounding Srila Prabhupada's Final Order on the Future 
              of Initiations Within ISKCON</i>, or simply, <i>The Final Order</i>, 
              has prompted the GBC to issue its own response entitled <i>Disciple 
              of My Disciple</i> (see, <a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#ref">dasa, 
              B., et. al.</a> 1997) along with promises that they will fully document 
              the history and theology of the guru in ISKCON as a way of finally 
              bringing the issue to rest. That, of course, is doubtful, for as 
              long as the gurus of ISKCON fail in the eyes of others to meet the 
              rigorous standards established by Srila Prabhupada, they will have 
              to continue to face their critics.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#24">24</a> 
            <p>At the very heart of this debate lies the succession issue: What 
              is the best way to routinise Prabhupada's charisma? Both sides agree 
              that Prabhupada must remain at the centre of ISKCON, but disagree 
              on how this may best be accomplished. Jayadvaita Swami sympathises 
              with the proxy-initiation proponents' thoughts: 
            <ul>
              <p>Srila Prabhupada was staunch, unfailing, always perfect in his 
                discretion and determination. He was undisputedly an exalted and 
                empowered <i>acarya,</i> a pure and intimate personal associate 
                of Krishna. Is it any wonder, then, that some devotees feel that 
                only Srila Prabhupada can give them shelter and that no one else 
                deserves the same surrender and trust? (Swami, J., 1996a) 
            </ul>
            <p>Yet, surrender and trust are the very currency of the guru-disciple 
              exchange. This is not a relationship of arbitrary acceptance, but 
              a contract in which total submission is offered in return for unalloyed 
              devotion to God. At stake in this debate is whether such a reward 
              is attainable, even generations from now, by establishing an exclusive 
              relationship with Prabhupada, bypassing such a relation with his 
              disciples or heirs. 
            <p>Proxy-initiation theorists insist that Prabhupada made a permanent 
              arrangement on 9 July 1977 when he approved this writer's letter 
              to all the temple presidents which stated, &quot;now that Srila 
              Prabhupada has named these eleven representatives, temple presidents 
              may henceforward send recommendations for first and second initiation 
              to whichever of these eleven representatives are nearest their temple.&quot;<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#25">25</a> 
              Making such a statement absolute renders it absurd, as Jayadvaita 
              Swami has vividly demonstrated (Swami, J., 1996b), and is opposed 
              to Prabhupada's time-bound use of the word 'henceforward' on numerous 
              occasions. Proxy-initiation theory supporters will lose their case 
              if their argument rests on haggling over the details of grammar 
              and punctuation in the appointment transcripts. Their strength is 
              in emphasising the value of directly connecting to Prabhupada's 
              purity. Otherwise, logic, reason, reliable testimony and scripture, 
              when used to interpret the transcripts will rule against them. 
            <p>But even the 'direct connection' argument will not necessarily 
              win the proxy-initiation case. Here is one counter argument: A guru 
              who presents himself as a humble and sincere disciple of Prabhupada 
              (or, in future generations, of any future guru in disciplic line) 
              offers Prabhupada 'directly' through his words and actions. What 
              better way to get Prabhupada's association than by connecting through 
              one who is immersed in Prabhupada's teachings and mission? The advantage 
              of being personally trained under the guidance of such a guru cannot 
              be denied. The process of receiving initiation formalises the student-teacher 
              relationship and offers the promise of God's mercy through the agency 
              of the disciplic succession. As a via media, the present guru magnifies 
              rather than obscures a disciple's vision of the previous gurus, 
              offering them access otherwise denied to those who try for it 'directly.' 
            <p>The counter argument continues: Prabhupada often stated that a 
              guru's success is to create at least one pure disciple. Did Prabhupada 
              fail so miserably that he could not create even one pure devotee 
              qualified to be a guru? Many of Prabhupada's disciples are 'pure' 
              in the sense that they have made his mission their life and soul. 
              Prabhupada's charisma may be that of a <i>maha-bhagavata</i>, a 
              topmost devotee of the Lord. But if his disciples have only been 
              able to individually capture a small fraction of that charisma, 
              it is stated in scripture that even their <i> madhyama-bhagavata</i> 
              (middle devotee) status is sufficient to qualify them for performing 
              initiations. Arguing that all of Prabhupada's offspring are spiritually 
              impotent, incapable of continuing the line of succession, appears 
              more as a condemnation of the founder rather than a glorification 
              of him. 
            <p>And so the arguments run. The debate continues, but the outcome 
              appears already decided. Though it is still not too late to rethink 
              the future course of guru theology, traditional antecedents and 
              the reality of present day ISKCON make such a redefinition highly 
              unlikely. Yet, the proxy-initiation theorists will have left their 
              mark. If nothing more, even their most vigorous critics can thank 
              them for helping to recognise all devotees' right to a real and 
              direct relationship with Prabhupada. 
            <p><b>Heresies of Continuity<br>
              </b> Religion cannot exist independent of culture, and any attempt 
              to transfer religious truths to a culture alien to that in which 
              they thrived must necessarily involve either a reformulation of 
              those truths or an attempt to recreate that original culture in 
              a new environment. In all four heresies of continuity, we see attempts 
              at both reformulation and re-creation. The '<i>sannyasi</i>-householder 
              controversy' deals with the recasting of traditional social relationships 
              in the context of mission. The '<i>gopi-bhava</i>' and '<i>rasika-bhakti</i> 
              controversies' are heresies of praxis; at stake are whether spiritual 
              disciplines should be esoteric or exoteric. The 'origin of the soul 
              heresy' attempts to understand the founder's view on this subject 
              and his consistency with previous members of the disciplic succession. 
              In fact, all the heresies of continuity concern the problems of 
              preservation of tradition-whether during the founder's time (between 
              his predecessors and himself) and during the time of his disciples 
              (between the founder and themselves). Though the tradition's beliefs 
              are at the forefront of these issues, the question of authority 
              is no less an issue here than it was with the previous heresies, 
              for arbiters must be there to decide exactly how traditions are 
              to continue. 
            <p><b>The <i>Sannyasi</i>-Householder Controversy<br>
              </b>The system of social/occupational relationships known as <i>varnashrama</i> 
              is the glue that kept Hindu society in place for thousands of years. 
              Its corruption in the form of brahminical elitism has led to its 
              deterioration, culminating in the recent victory of scheduled caste 
              'untouchables' in India's parliamentary elections. Strange, it would 
              seem that Prabhupada should have chosen to swim with the current 
              of castism, considering its history and its potential for creating 
              conflict. 
            <p>Even a casual reading of Hindu texts, however, reveals that <i>varnashrama</i> 
              is the warp and woof of the Hindu social fabric; traditionalists 
              fear its absence will leave society threadbare, to disintegrate. 
              Prabhupada certainly held such a belief. As early as 1968 he began 
              to create a caste of <i>brahmanas,</i><a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#26">26</a> 
              much to the chagrin of India's caste-conscious, hereditary <i>brahmanas</i> 
              who bitterly complained that he was spoiling Vedic culture. But 
              Prabhupada defended his action with a battery of scriptural proof 
              texts, proving caste was according to one's qualities and work, 
              not birth. (Prabhupada1986: 238-9) He accused his priestly detractors 
              of ignorance and selfishness, and blamed them for nearly destroying 
              an ideal social model. The theological basis for his argument was 
              simple: a Vaishnava (a devotee of God) is considered transcendental 
              to all the designations of <i> varna</i> and <i>ashrama.</i> Hence, 
              a devotee is automatically a <i>brahmana.</i> His guru had encountered 
              similar opposition a half century earlier, and Sri Caitanya had 
              fought the identical battle when he had given elevated positions 
              in his movement to many of his lower birth associates. 
            <p>There were no such opponents in twentieth century egalitarian America. 
              The possibility of upward socio/ spiritual mobility was practically 
              guaranteed by ISKCON's initiation system and nearly all devotees 
              were awarded brahminical initiation a year after their first initiation.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#27">27</a> 
              However, <i>sannyasa,</i> the renounced order, was far more restricted. 
              Due to the degree of renunciation, all the members of society including 
              the <i>brahmanas</i> respected a <i>sannyasa.</i> Here lay the potential 
              for real conflict, for unlike brahmanism, which in ISKCON was open 
              to all, there were relatively few sannyasis. While in India tension 
              existed between the <i>varnas,</i> or castes, the danger in ISKCON 
              was the antagonism between the <i>ashramas,</i> the Vedic social 
              divisions based on the major life-cycle categories. 
            <p>A controversy pitting <i>sannyasis</i> against <i>grihasthas</i> 
              (married householders) erupted in 1975. A number of seasoned ISKCON 
              <i>sannyasis,</i> including this writer, returned to America after 
              years of public preaching in India. But India and America were not 
              analogous preaching fields. In India, <i>sannyasis</i> assisted 
              by <i>brahmacaris</i> (celibate male students) traditionally managed 
              the temples, ministering to the laity, who in return supported them. 
              No such economic interdependence existed in ISKCON of the mid-seventies. 
              Few devotees had outside employment. Everyone - <i>sannyasis,brahmacaris</i> 
              and <i>grihasthas</i> - simply 'depended upon Krishna,' which practically 
              meant raising funds through literature distribution. Most temple 
              presidents were <i>grihasthas,</i> assisted by <i>brahmacaris</i> 
              and <i>brahmacarinis</i> (female celibate students), whose principal 
              engagement was financing the temples through the sale of ISKCON 
              literature. 
            <p>The newly arrived <i>sannyasis,</i> with tales of their missionary 
              experiences in India, were appealing to many of the temple <i>brahmacaris,</i> 
              who were attracted by their austerity, knowledge and zealousness, 
              as well as by the freedom offered by the lifestyle of the itinerant 
              preachers. Many <i>brahmacaris</i> abandoned the temples. Within 
              a year's time, no less than ten <i>sannyasi</i> parties, assisted 
              by 200 <i>brahmacaris,</i> criss-crossed America. Temple presidents 
              felt the <i>sannyasis'</i> visits were more for recruiting local 
              <i>brahmacari</i> residents to leave the temples than for uplifting 
              and protecting the spiritual standards. 
            <p>The conflict came to a head at the annual all-ISKCON festival in 
              Mayapur, West Bengal, in March of 1976. The <i>sannyasi</i>-dominated 
              GBC body,<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#28">28</a> under the chairmanship 
              of this writer, passed a number of controversial resolutions: 'Husbandless 
              women with children could not live in an ISKCON temple. Husband 
              and wife could not live in ISKCON temples, even if separately. Before 
              entering marriage, devotees should have a means of supporting themselves 
              and not expect to 'live off' ISKCON. Upon getting married a householder 
              would be financially responsible for his wife until such time as 
              he took <i>sannyasa</i> .' (Goswami, S. 1983: Vol. VI: 168) 
            <p>These resolutions reveal a deeply negative view of sexuality and 
              of women that was particularly prevalent in the early years of ISKCON. 
              This attitude is not without scriptural basis, for attachments of 
              any sort (especially to the opposite sex), when not overcome, are 
              believed to cause the soul to be reborn. The illusory material potency 
              Maya, the consort of the male god Shiva, is portrayed as a prison-house 
              keeper, and those who share her gender are considered to be her 
              representatives. This schema sees women as the cause of bondage 
              and their birth as misfortune. However, it is not an accurate reflection 
              of scriptural conclusion, as has been explained elsewhere: 
            <ul>
              <p>The proper [scriptural] understanding reveals that any unfair 
                sexual bias implied by the Maya narrative is due to a philosophical 
                misunderstanding. For the feminine gender is generic to all souls 
                including those who are masculine embodied. All souls are categorised 
                as energy (read female) and God as the supreme energetic (read 
                male). When this philosophy is properly understood, all souls 
                irrespective of their sexual bodily encoding will relate with 
                each other harmoniously. (Goswami, T. K. 1996: 100) 
            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately, events in ISKCON have often demonstrated what an 
              enormous gap separates philosophical ideals from their historical 
              reality. The sannyasis of ISKCON, this writer as much as any others, 
              viewed women as <i>maya,</i> to be avoided whenever possible. We 
              shared our 'wisdom' with the <i>brahmacaris:</i> 'A woman is like 
              fire, a man like butter. If the butter is not kept at a safe distance, 
              it will melt.' Those <i>brahmacaris</i> who melted were 'fallen,' 
              and were to be married. Due to their intimate association with women, 
              they too were also representatives of <i>maya,</i> and henceforward, 
              their association was also to be avoided. 
            <p>The resolutions passed by the predominantly <i>sannyasi</i> GBC 
              body attempted to selectively legislate certain aspects of India's 
              long-standing social system. That they were ill-suited to America 
              and particularly to the prevailing conditions within ISKCON was 
              clear from Prabhupada's response as he sought to prevent further 
              escalation of the controversy. He disapproved of preventing single 
              mothers with children from living in the temple: &quot;I cannot 
              discriminate - man, woman, child, rich, poor, educated, or foolish. 
              Let them all come, and let them take Krishna consciousness, so that 
              they will not waste their human life.&quot; (Goswami, S. 1983: Vol. 
              VI: 168) 
            <p>When the North American <i>grihastha</i> temple presidents arrived, 
              the discriminatory legislation and its potential to split ISKCON 
              alarmed them. During his morning walks, Prabhupada sought to mediate, 
              suggesting that the <i>grihasthas</i> form a small committee to 
              define how they should live. One of the leading <i>sannyasis</i> 
              argued that the problem was that <i>grihasthas</i> had a propensity 
              for enjoyment that undermined the austere temple atmosphere. Their 
              association was thus unfavourable for both <i>brahmacaris</i> and 
              <i>sannyasis</i>. 
            <p>&quot;Fanaticism!&quot; was Prabhupada's response. &quot;We should 
              always remember that either <i>grihastha, brahmacari </i>or<i> sannyasa</i>, 
              nobody can strictly follow all the rules and regulations. In the 
              Kali-yuga it is not possible. If I simply find fault with you, and 
              if you find fault with me, then it will be factional, and our real 
              business will be hampered. Therefore, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended 
              that <i>hari-nama</i>, chanting Hare Krishna mantra, should be very 
              rigidly performed, which is common for everyone - <i>grihastha,vranaprastha</i> 
              (the retired order), and <i>sannyasa.</i> They should always chant 
              Hare Krishna mantra, then everything will be adjusted. Otherwise, 
              it is impossible to advance.' (Goswami, S. 1983: Vol. VI: 172) 
            <p> Although Prabhupada appreciated the service of his leading <i>sannyasis</i> 
              and their men which amounted to more than 50% of the distribution 
              of his publications worldwide, he was clearly displeased with their 
              sectarian views. It was inappropriate for them to constantly dwell 
              on the <i>grihasthas'</i> affairs. He told a story of two <i>brahmanas</i> 
              who were about to cross a river when a lady approached them for 
              help in crossing. One of the <i>brahmanas</i> took her on his back 
              and assisted her across. After she had departed the two <i>brahmanas</i> 
              continued their journey, but the other <i>brahmana</i> continuously 
              criticised his associate for allowing a woman to touch his body. 
              At last his friend had had enough: &quot;I carried her on my back 
              for ten minutes, but you have been carrying her on your mind for 
              three hours!&quot;<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#29">29</a> 
            <p> The misunderstanding did not abate; the polarisation so surcharged 
              the festival atmosphere Prabhupada was unable to rest. Finally, 
              he decided to call a meeting of the contesting parties. He heard 
              attentively a neutral <i>brahmacari's</i> conclusion: the real issue 
              was men and money. By encouraging the <i>brahmacaris</i> not to 
              cooperate with <i>grihasthas,</i> the <i>sannyasis</i> were luring 
              them away from the temples to travel and preach, which not only 
              created a financial strain on the temples, but also left many important 
              services unattended. Prabhupada heard the stories from all sides, 
              then gave his conclusive opinion. Discriminating between <i>grihastha</i> 
              and <i>sannyasa</i> was wrong. Everyone should be judged by his 
              advancement in Krishna consciousness. &quot;Whether one is a brahmana, 
              a sannyasi or a sudra-regardless of what he is-he can become a spiritual 
              master if he knows the science of Krishna.&quot; (Prabhupada1975: 
              162)<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#30">30</a> Party politics would 
              finish everything. There was no particular service for a <i>grihastha,</i> 
              another for a <i>sannyasi.</i> All were servants of Krishna and 
              should do the needful. Anyone can preach and anyone can serve in 
              the temple. It was all right for a <i>brahmacari</i> to want to 
              travel with a <i>sannyasi,</i> but if he had a responsible temple 
              service, he must not leave. <i>ashramas</i> do not determine the 
              quality of a devotee. The GBC was asked to strike out the biased 
              resolutions. The temple presidents felt vindicated. 
            <p>In fact, it was actually a victory for all. As their spiritual 
              master, Prabhupada was emphasising the theological principle of 
              the transcendental equality of all <i>ashramas:</i> the <i>ashramas</i> 
              might define one's temporal situation, but one's eternal identity 
              was primary. Service to Krishna was the basis for mutual co-operation 
              between all sectors of society.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#31">31</a> 
            <p><b>The Gopi-bhava Club Heresy<br>
              </b>While negative views of mundane sexuality thread their way through 
              much of the scripture, the same literature (paradoxically, some 
              would say) reverences conjugal love as the highest devotion to God. 
              That ISKCON faced a heresy involving <i>gopi-bhava</i> (the loving 
              mood of the <i>gopis</i>) is not surprising, nor was it the first 
              time the Gaudiya line had had to resolve such a contentious issue. 
              The culmination of Vaishnava religious practice is the attainment 
              of flawless love for the Deity. For Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the love 
              of the <i>gopis,</i> Krishna's cowherd lovers, is considered most 
              consummate. But ever since Shi Chaitanya established the primacy 
              of <i>parakiya-bhava</i> (love out of wedlock), there has been no 
              dearth of questions involving morality and practice. Perhaps no 
              other tradition explores in such vivid detail the possibilities 
              of the conjugal relationship between the devotee and the Godhead. 
              Considering the extensive textual tradition devoted to this subject, 
              the reserve most practitioners display for such topics is impressive. 
              The texts warn that highly advanced devotees can only understand 
              Krishna's conjugal pastimes; premature attempts to enter such esoteric 
              topics will end in mundane lust-the opposite of spiritual love. 
              Most advanced devotees are understandably cautious, considering 
              themselves unqualified. It is neither practical nor theologically 
              correct to expect everyone to be able to rise to the exalted level 
              of the <i>gopis'</i> love. Other relationships with Krishna-parental, 
              fraternal, and servile love-are equally desirable. In fact, each 
              soul is said constitutionally to have an eternal relationship with 
              the Godhead, and realisation of that relationship is more a matter 
              of acceptance than selection. In any case, attainment of perfect 
              love is gradual, and it can be arduous. 
            <p>In his discourse, Prabhupada usually spoke of <i>bhakti</i> generically. 
              Yet he did not hesitate to translate Rupa Goswami's <i> Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu</i>, 
              a work entirely devoted to analysing devotional relationships. His 
              seventeen-volume translation of Krishnadasa Kaviraja's <i>Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita</i> 
              highlights many intimate pastimes in which Chaitanya and his companions 
              became absorbed in and identified with the conjugal mood of Radha 
              and her companions. However, Prabhupada repeatedly warned his audiences 
              not to compare these wholly transcendental descriptions with their 
              seemingly mundane equivalents. 
            <p> In spite of this, a group of his disciples - perhaps twenty-five 
              women and an equal number of men - began meeting surreptitiously 
              to read the portions of <i>Chaitanya-charitamrita </i>that describe 
              Radha and Krishna's intimate pastimes. News of the '<i>Gopi-bhava</i> 
              Club' reached Prabhupada during his visit to Los Angeles in June 
              of 1976. Calling the available GBC members and <i>sannyasis,</i> 
              Prabhupada ordered an investigation. He expressed grave concern 
              that such meetings, if allowed to go unchecked, would lead to illicit 
              activities, thus thwarting the preaching mission. 
            <p>The club leaders appeared before Prabhupada explaining that they 
              were not trying to imitate Radha and Krishna's love affairs but 
              simply studying the descriptions in order to develop such desires. 
              Prabhupada's lips quivered with anger: &quot;First deserve, then 
              desire! . . . So long as there is any pinch of material desire there 
              is no question of desiring on the spiritual platform!&quot; (dasa, 
              H. 1992: Vol. II: 268) 
            <p>When another of their leaders asked what harm there could be if 
              they restricted their readings to Prabhupada's books, Prabhupada 
              quickly refuted his argument: Many medicines may be available in 
              a drug store but that does not mean one can get them without a prescription. 
              Medicines are prescribed according to the disease. Similarly, his 
              books might contain descriptions of every stage of devotion from 
              the beginning practices to the highest development of love of God, 
              but one should concentrate on those sections suitable to one's level 
              of realisation. 
            <p>Prabhupada's experience extended far beyond the limited knowledge 
              of his disciples. Growing up in Bengal and later on living for years 
              in Vandavana, he had ample opportunity to observe the behaviour 
              of the various <i>sahajiya</i> sects who attempted to sacramentalise 
              mundane, human sex. The <i>sahajiyas</i> were renounced in appearance, 
              dressed in a bare loincloth of <i>babajis</i> and living on the 
              simplest of diet. But their illicit sexual behaviour belied their 
              appearance and drew heavy criticism from the orthodox Gaudiya Vaishnavas. 
              Prabhupada inferred that some of his disciples must have associated 
              with Vrindavana <i>babajis</i> and become contaminated. He required 
              no further facts to reach his conclusion. Walking the next morning 
              with a group of disciples, he explained the background of the contamination. 
              (Prabhupada1990: Vol. XXI: 1-3) A segment of Chaitanya's movement 
              had deviated from his strict principles, appropriating the model 
              of Krishna and the <i>gopis'</i> love affairs for their debauchery. 
              Lacking any spiritual qualification, they still aspired for the 
              highest transcendental level of understanding. Prabhupada likened 
              the attempt to an ignorant fool's desiring a Ph.D. As his predecessors 
              had laboured to free Chaitanya's movement from the <i>sahajiya</i> 
              stigma, Prabhupada acted to protect ISKCON in the same way. &quot;Keep 
              your movement very pure. Don't mind if somebody goes away. But we 
              must keep our principles pure.&quot; (Prabhupada1990: Vol. XXI: 
              5) 
            <p>This appeared to be a marked departure from Prabhupada's response 
              to other deviations. He seemed more willing to sacrifice a few for 
              the protection of the many. ISKCON's swelling population may have 
              provided him the confidence that his movement would survive such 
              losses. At the same time, a large organisation offered the risk 
              of many becoming contaminated. Based on what had happened in Chaitanya's 
              movement, there was historical precedence to justify such fear. 
              The promiscuity prevalent in Western society seemed to make such 
              a possibility all the more likely, ISKCON's puritanical rules notwithstanding. 
              The danger was misapplying theological doctrine. To use Prabhupada's 
              medical analogy, it was a case of wrong prescription. If a disease 
              was wrongly diagnosed and too strong a medicine supplied, the result, 
              as Prabhupada later stated, would not 'purify,' but rather 'putrefy.' 
            <p><b>The <i>Rasika-bhakti</i> Heresy<br>
              </b>Though Prabhupada's disapproval of the '<i>Gopi-bhava</i> Club' 
              was well documented, a similar attempt was made again, some fifteen 
              years after his departure. That the group included four members 
              of the GBC and other gurus as well, added to the spectre of large 
              numbers of their followers becoming deviated. These devotees were 
              based in Vrindavana at ISKCON's Krishna-Balarama Temple. But perhaps 
              most alarming was their allegiance to an elder Gaudiya Matha <i>sannyasi.</i> 
              The <i>rasika-bhakti </i>controversy,<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#32"> 
              32</a> as it came to be known, was the re-occurrence of a problem 
              - premature 'realisation' - Prabhupada had seemingly resolved, coupled 
              with a challenge to authority. 
            <p>The elder <i>sannyasi</i> Narayana Maharaja was a disciple of Prabhupada's 
              <i>sannyasa</i> guru and was long a well-wisher of ISKCON. A learned, 
              austere, long-time resident of Vrindavana, he has a fondness for 
              narrating <i>rasa-katha,</i> the sublime topics of Krishna's Vrindavana 
              pastimes. A small group of prominent ISKCON men and women were gradually 
              drawn into his association, ignoring history, GBC resolutions on 
              the books which forbade such outside association, and ample warnings 
              from their peers as well. Narayana Maharaja made no effort to conceal 
              his relationship with them, which as time went on became increasingly 
              intimate. When invited by ISKCON to a number of public functions, 
              he frankly proclaimed that ISKCON devotees should not remain neophyte, 
              clinging simply to rules and regulations, but should follow the 
              path of spontaneous devotion. His emphasis on <i>gopi-bhava</i>, 
              the mood of Krishna's amorous cowherd lovers, particularly disturbed 
              his ISKCON audiences who were conscious of so many warnings from 
              Prabhupada. Prabhupada had stressed that the path of spontaneous 
              devotion was only for liberated souls. He personally taught and 
              exemplified the activities of devotion performed according to rules 
              and regulations. Once a practitioner became purified of all material 
              inebrieties, spontaneous devotion would automatically manifest. 
              Yet, the ISKCON followers of Narayana Maharaja felt they were making 
              tangible spiritual advancement by following his advice and example. 
              They were increasing their chanting, became attached to the sacred 
              places where Krishna had performed His pastimes, and were generally 
              experiencing an overall deepening of their Krishna consciousness. 
              Prabhupada, they believed, was now guiding them in the person of 
              Narayana Maharaja. 
            <p>At the annual GBC meeting in 1993, members questioned their affiliation 
              with Narayana Maharaja. Those involved minimised the seriousness 
              of the relationship, though for some it had been going on for as 
              long as five years. Trusting in their word, the GBC let the matter 
              pass. But concern continued, especially among the ISKCON devotees 
              residing in Vrindavana who felt Narayana Maharaja's influence slowly 
              pervade the Krishna-Balarama Temple complex. By their next annual 
              meeting, the GBC forced the involved members to promise to greatly 
              restrict further association with their new teacher. 
            <p>Though adhering externally, their sympathies for Narayana Maharaja's 
              teachings were unabated. Paintings done under his supervision depicting 
              Radha and Krishna's intimacy became popular throughout ISKCON. Devotees 
              sprinkled their lectures increasingly with <i>rasa-katha.</i> Narayana 
              Maharaja was even attracting a following in a few ISKCON centres. 
              The tension finally came to a head at the anniversary celebration 
              of Srila Prabhupada's entering the <i>sannyasa</i> order, traditionally 
              held at Narayana Maharaja's temple where the actual <i>sannyasa</i> 
              ceremony had taken place in 1959. Tamal Krishna Goswami and Giriraja 
              Swami, rather than glorifying Prabhupada, used the occasion to praise 
              Narayana Maharaja, recommending his association to all of ISKCON. 
              Narayana Maharaja spoke next. He pointed out that there were many 
              higher teachings that Prabhupada could have given had his disciples 
              been more advanced. He implied that Prabhupada's missionary work 
              was elementary and ISKCON devotees were now ready for the more advanced 
              stage of Krishna consciousness, which he could give. 
            <p>Though none at the meeting voiced their protest, the indignation 
              evoked by these speeches reverberated world-wide. Many felt that 
              things had gone too far and that the GBC must now take a firm stand. 
              Narayana Maharaja's followers, however, would not back down; believing 
              that he was misunderstood, they met other ISKCON leaders in India, 
              Europe and North America to promote their cause. But they had not 
              correctly anticipated the response, especially from the North American 
              temple presidents. This influential group, the same who were primarily 
              responsible for putting an end to the zonal-acarya era, demanded 
              those following Narayana Maharaja be stripped of their positions. 
              Many feared that the movement was heading for a major schism. 
            <p>This time the GBC was firm. The <i>rasika-bhakti</i> controversy 
              was first on the 1995 annual meeting's agenda. A week of thorough 
              investigation brought the implicated members in line. They admitted 
              that by promoting a non-ISKCON authority and his teachings, they 
              had relativised Prabhupada and his teachings. Many neophyte devotees 
              were already following their example and, as Prabhupada had predicted 
              during the <i>gopi-bhava</i> affair, missionary activities were 
              being minimised to focus on personal spiritual advancement. 
            <p>Asked to suggest what they might do to make amends, the leaders 
              involved with the controversy tendered their resignations, which 
              the GBC promptly refused. They further volunteered to refrain from 
              initiating new disciples or visiting Vrindavana until their case 
              could be reassessed the following year. They promised to disassociate 
              themselves entirely from Narayana Maharaja and to correct any misunderstandings 
              created by their past behaviour. When the year passed, the GBC was 
              not entirely convinced of their contrition and at the March 1996 
              meeting insisted on maintaining most of the restrictions. 
            <p>Considering that they had avoided a split, one might conclude that 
              the GBC should have relaxed the sanctions with a mood to fully reconcile 
              both parties. Many of the GBC wanted this and they were finally 
              presented the opportunity when Narayana Maharaja announced he would 
              tour the West. His visits to Holland and England were arranged by 
              disenchanted former members of ISKCON and were solely aimed at attracting 
              an ISKCON audience. Some members of ISKCON's congregation were initiated 
              without consideration of Prabhupada's strict standards. 
            <p>Though Narayana Maharaja praised Prabhupada's accomplishments and 
              expressed his desire to see ISKCON united, the GBC considered his 
              tour anything but unifying. They called upon Narayana Maharaja's 
              former GBC followers to help draft a document that would clearly 
              express this conclusion. The resulting paper entitled '<i>Keeping 
              Faith with Srila Prabhupada </i>' was released world-wide through 
              the Internet. ISKCON leaders, while offering hospitable greetings 
              whenever Narayana Maharaja and his entourage visited an ISKCON temple, 
              made certain that he had little opportunity to contact ISKCON devotees. 
              By the time his tour ended in July, though dozens took initiation 
              from him in Europe and North America, there seemed to be little 
              overall impact within ISKCON's temples from his visit. Nevertheless, 
              he announced his intention to extend his tour later in the year 
              to include Australasia.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#33">33</a> 
            <p>A lingering concern to ISKCON are the disciples of a recently deceased 
              ISKCON guru, and those of gurus who are fallen, some of whom are 
              attracted to Narayana Maharaja. While the capitulation of the GBC 
              members previously following Narayana Maharaja has certainly demonstrated 
              GBC solidarity, that in itself will not be enough to prevent the 
              continued exodus of devotees who feel unable to repose full faith 
              in some ISKCON authority. Apart from their critics' cavilling, ISKCON 
              gurus must satisfy their disciples' legitimate expectations that 
              they be knowledgeable, self-controlled and realised. But trying 
              to emulate Prabhupada and his predecessors' perfection prematurely 
              can only lead others to further disenchantment. 
            <p><b>The Origin of the Soul Heresy<br>
              </b>Understanding origins is basic to nearly every thought system. 
              For the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the question translates: Did the living 
              entities, now in material existence of repeated birth and death, 
              fall from the spiritual realm where they were enjoying personal 
              relationships with Krishna? Or, is there no fall, since souls are 
              described as either 'eternally liberated' or 'eternally bound'? 
              Concomitantly, how can they be eternally bound when the material 
              realm is temporary, when their relation or <i>rasa</i> with Krishna 
              is innate, and when there is a possibility that they may one day 
              be liberated by God's grace? While these particular questions have 
              been part of ISKCON's ongoing ontological debate, raising them after 
              Prabhupada's departure brought up fundamental questions about the 
              authority of Prabhupada's teachings. 
            <p>This is not a modern dilemma, as relevant statements from the <i>Vedanta-sutra</i> 
              and <i>Upanishads</i> evince. The founders of every principal Indian 
              school of thought have offered their particular explanation, and 
              it is still a topic of interest today. As any ISKCON lecturer will 
              certify, no other subject raises more questions. 
            <p>Prabhupada dealt extensively with the topic in his books, correspondence, 
              lectures and conversations. Yet his disciples were perplexed: 'If 
              Krishna is all-attractive, and we were once liberated souls, why 
              would we ever have chosen to leave Krishna's association?' 'Due 
              to misuse of free will, Prabhupada would respond.' 'But why?!' devotees 
              would demand to know. 'Because we are tiny, insignificant,' would 
              be Prabhupada's reply. 
            <p>But devotees remained dissatisfied. It still seemed illogical. 
              As early as 1967, Prabhupada wrote: 
            <ul>
              <p>About your question: the spirit soul is certainly eternal and 
                changeless; and the fall is superficial, just like the relation 
                between father and son cannot be broken ever. Now we are simply 
                in a phase of forgetfulness, and this forgetfulness is called 
                <i>maya.</i> There is a nice example of the waning of the moon. 
                To us the moon appears to be changing, but in fact, the moon is 
                always the same. So as eternal servitors of Krishna - our constitutional 
                position - we fall down when we try to become the enjoyer, imitating 
                Krishna. (See letter to Jananivasa, Prabhupada1987: Vol. I: 200) 
            </ul>
            <p>In another letter, Prabhupada tried to sort out a devotee's paradoxical 
              questions: 
            <ul>
              <p>Your next question, 'Is a pure devotee eternally liberated and 
                if so is he at any time a conditioned soul? We are eternally conditioned, 
                but as soon as we surrender to Krishna do we then become eternally 
                liberated?' You are not eternally conditioned. You are eternally 
                liberated but since we have become conditioned on account of our 
                desire to enjoy a materialistic way of life, from time immemorial, 
                therefore it appears that we are eternally conditioned. Because 
                we cannot trace out the history or the date when we became conditioned, 
                therefore it is technically called eternally conditioned. Otherwise 
                the living entity is not actually conditioned. The living entity 
                is always pure. (See, Goswami, H. d. 1996: 200) 
            </ul>
            <p>In 1972, in response to a letter from his Australian disciples, 
              Prabhupada dictated a brief essay entitled 'Crow and Tala-fruit 
              Logic.' Prabhupada explains that the soul is never actually separated 
              from Krishna, but only dreams of such separation. 
            <ul>
              <p>We never had any occasion when we were separated from Krishna. 
                Just like one man is dreaming and he forgets himself. In a dream 
                he creates himself in different forms: now I am the king discussing 
                like that. This creation of himself is as seer and subject matter 
                or seen, two things. But as soon as the dream is over the 'seen' 
                disappears. But the seer remains. Now he is in his original position 
                . . . We cannot say therefore that we are not with Krishna. As 
                soon as we try to become Lord, immediately we are covered by <i>maya</i> 
                [illusion]. Formerly we were with Krishna in his <i>lila</i> or 
                sport. But this covering of <i>maya</i> may be very, very, very, 
                very long duration, therefore many creations are coming and going. 
                Due to this long period of time it is sometimes said that we are 
                ever-conditioned. But this long duration of time becomes very 
                insignificant when one actually comes to Krishna consciousness. 
                Just like in a dream we are thinking very long time, but as soon 
                as we awaken we look at our watch and see it has become a moment 
                only. (See Goswami, H. d. 1996: 1879-8) 
            </ul>
            <p>Most ISKCON readers wondered, in the light of such clear explanations 
              from their founder, how this subject managed to remain a burning 
              issue within ISKCON. But the seeming paradoxical nature of Prabhupada's 
              answers resists systematisation and argue for alternative readings. 
              The influence of Gaudiya Matha and other non-ISKCON authorities, 
              whose presentation of the subject sometimes differed from Prabhupada's, 
              further added to the confusion. New translations of important Vaishnava 
              texts also began to appear. Where these translations seemed at variance 
              with Prabhupada's translations or his teachings, controversy arose. 
            <p>One divergent view holds that the bound soul originally came from 
              the <i>brahmajyoti,</i> the effulgent region of light surrounding 
              Krishna's abode. Such souls have never enjoyed a personal relationship 
              with Krishna. In the same 'Crow and Tala-fruit' essay, Prabhupada 
              rejects this idea, stating that the soul may have more recently 
              come from the brahmajyoti but originally was with Krishna. Prabhupada 
              counsels that it is a waste of time to argue whether our origin 
              is in Krishna's abode or the region of light surrounding it: 
            <ul>
              <p>On the top of the tree there is nice Tala-fruit. A crow went 
                there and the fruit fell down. Some <i>panditas</i> (big, big 
                learned scholars) saw this and discussed: 'The fruit fell down 
                due to the crow's agitating the limb.' 'No, the fruit fell simultaneously 
                with the crow landing and frightened the crow so he flew away.' 
                'No, the fruit was ripe and the weight of the crow landing broke 
                it from the branch,' and so on and so on. What is the use of such 
                discussions? So, whether you were in the <i>brahma-sayujya</i> 
                or with Krishna in His <i>lila, </i> at the moment you are in 
                neither, so the best policy is to develop your Krishna consciousness 
                and go there, never mind what is your origin. (See Goswami, H. 
                d. 1996: 189-90) 
            </ul>
            <p>But pundits (and ISKCON pundits are no exception) seem never to 
              tire of debate. When the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust decided to publish 
              Jiva Goswami's <i>Sat Sandarbhas</i>, there was constant contention 
              over the subtle nuances in translating Sanskrit terms. When two 
              of the appointed members of the translation team insisted that Jiva 
              Goswami was absolutely clear-bound souls have not fallen, but have 
              always been eternally bound-a serious controversy arose. The remaining 
              translators maintained that the Goswami's viewpoint was consistent 
              with Prabhupada's-souls have fallen to this world from the spiritual 
              realm. 
            <p>Drutakarma dasa, an ISKCON scholar, subsequently completed an impressive 
              compilation of quotations entitled 'Once We Were with Krishna' to 
              establish that the conclusions of all the great teachers descended 
              from Chaitanya concur with Prabhupada's position on the fall of 
              the soul. In response, the two dissenting members of the translation 
              team published a book, <i>In Vaikuntha Not Even the Leaves Fall</i>, 
              so titled to emphasise their view that in Vaikuntha, the spiritual 
              realm, if even leaves do not fall, certainly souls do not either. 
              Observing the escalating controversy, the BBT trustees decided to 
              put the <i>Sandarbha</i> project on hold. 
            <p>Even before the publication of <i> Leaves,</i> the authors' opinions 
              were already circulating and had gained some support. The GBC was 
              less alarmed by the immediate confusion caused by the controversy 
              than the long-range consequences of the conclusions in this book. 
              Particularly disturbing was the contention that Prabhupada's statements 
              about the fall of the soul were merely a preaching strategy adopted 
              to suit a particular time and circumstance, and did not represent 
              his actual conviction. The authors maintained that Prabhupada was 
              in agreement with all previous teachers in the line, but had made 
              adjustments as a convenient means of expressing a complex philosophical 
              concept for a Judeo-Christian audience unfamiliar with Sanskrit 
              terms or the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy. Many wondered what possible 
              cataclysmic events could have occurred since Prabhupada's time to 
              so alter the circumstances as to require the authors to change Prabhupada's 
              preaching strategy (if indeed that is all it was). Their reason 
              for concern was obvious: once one aspect of Prabhupada's teaching 
              is labelled a mere preaching ploy, there is nothing to ensure that 
              whatever else he taught was not equally a deception. <i>Leaves</i> 
              threatened to undermine the very philosophical foundation of ISKCON. 
            <p>The GBC at their annual meeting in 1995 took steps to check such 
              an occurrence. They resolved first, that the view expressed in Prabhupada's 
              commentary to the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 4.28.54, namely, that 
              the original position of the soul is to be in a personal relationship 
              with Krishna, which having been rejected leads to fall-down into 
              the material world, is ISKCON's official view and none other should 
              be presented under any circumstance. (Prabhupada1987: 4.28.54) Second, 
              regarding philosophical controversies, Prabhupada's instructions 
              and personal example are to be the first and primary source for 
              ISKCON devotees. Vedic literatures, the writings of the past <i> 
              acharyas,</i> and even the current teachings of any bonafide non-ISKCON 
              <i>acarya</i> must be viewed through Prabhupada's teachings. Finally, 
              the GBC rejected the speculation that Prabhupada practiced deception. 
              The book <i>In Vaikuntha Not Even the Leaves Fall </i>was banned.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#34">34</a> 
            <p>Neither of the authors was philosophically satisfied by this legislation, 
              though they were willing to have the book withdrawn. But the purpose 
              of the resolution was simply to stave off further confusion. The 
              GBC had already concluded that a thorough response to the <i>Leaves</i> 
              book was required. By the time of the next annual meeting, they 
              published a comprehensive refutation, <i>Our Original Position</i>. 
              This book labours extensively to define key Sanskrit terms used 
              by Prabhupada and the previous <i>acharyas</i> with reference to 
              the soul. The authors establish the logic and consistency of Prabhupada's 
              presentation, then demonstrate how it is supported by previous <i>acharyas.</i> 
              In his preface to the volume, Hridayananda dasa Goswami explains 
              the view which he and the other authors maintained while compiling 
              the work: &quot;The members of ISKCON, who live perpetually at the 
              feet of Srila Prabhupada, may speculate how Srila Prabhupada's statements 
              are true, but they may not challenge his statements, or claim that 
              they are false. This is precisely what it means to accept Srila 
              Prabhupada as the founder-<i>acharya</i>.&quot; (Goswami, H. d. 
              1996: viii) 
            <p>The publication of the GBC Press book seems to have had the desired 
              effect. ISKCON devotees are now nearly of one mind on this issue, 
              though a few (including the two contesting authors) have not been 
              swayed. Both authors' participation within ISKCON was restricted, 
              and they were asked to vacate their rent-free ISKCON residences. 
              The resolution of this issue was reached over a period of more than 
              four years during which time great effort was made to consider how 
              to preserve both persons' participation in the Society's activities. 
              The Chairman of the GBC explained at the time that either was again 
              welcome to become active, but they would have to first demonstrate 
              that they have changed their philosophical views. While ISKCON does 
              not insist that all its members must hold to a particular persuasion, 
              it does insist on certain policies for those engaged in teaching. 
            <p><b>Concluding Remarks<br>
              </b>Larry Shinn: 'I think the movement will fare well precisely 
              to the extent that the leaders adhere to the spiritual practices 
              taught by Prabhupada and have achieved the kinds of levels of spiritual 
              advancement that comes with these practices.' (Gelberg, Steven J., 
              ed. 1983: 100) We have seen that much of the debate over authority 
              and continuity has focused on this issue: namely, whether current 
              GBC members and gurus are spiritually qualified. This same question 
              will undoubtedly continue to be raised when considering ongoing 
              succession. As the present generation of gurus expires, how will 
              each of their disciplic lines be perpetuated? Disciples may feel 
              it their duty to pass on to the next generation the unique contributions 
              they believe their guru has bequeathed them. Will they be permitted 
              to accept disciples of their own in the presence of their guru's 
              godbrothers? Previously reviewing the plea of an elderly and learned 
              ISKCON <i>sannyasi</i> who sought permission to accept disciples 
              while his own guru was still alive, the GBC maintained that Prabhupada 
              clearly taught that such action would violate Vaishnava etiquette. 
              But what will be the GBC's response if the request comes from someone 
              much more junior whose guru happens to have departed? Though the 
              GBC is now well established as the legitimate successors to the 
              founder-<i>acarya</i>, Srila Prabhupada, the mechanics of further 
              succession, if left unresolved, are potentially schismatic. 
            <p>Nor is the problem limited to disciplic succession: the GBC has, 
              until this year, resisted any efforts to include a member of the 
              next generation within its ranks.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#35">35</a> 
              How could a disciple participate in reprimanding his guru, as the 
              GBC has had to do in the past? But neither old age nor death will 
              be checked, and the present generation of GBC members will ultimately 
              be replaced. The appointment this year of 30 deputies to assist 
              the GBC at their annual meeting may be a preliminary step in the 
              eventual transfer of authority.<a href="5_1perilsfoot.html#36">36</a> 
            <p>The appointment of new deputies has highlighted what some see as 
              a major problem. As one North American appointee remarked, the whole 
              concept was made 'short-sighted' and 'a bit ludicrous' for failing 
              to include a single woman. He asks, if 'the original statement of 
              the GBC for the purpose of expanding this body is to &quot;help 
              make the GBC more relevant to the needs of the society while creating 
              valuable training opportunities for these members,&quot; shouldn't 
              it (the GBC) be anxious for the input of 50% of the membership of 
              the society (its women)?' 
            <p>Gender has been a slowly simmering issue, one that many ISKCON 
              leaders have been extremely unwilling to acknowledge. Many women 
              refuse to join an organisation that is fundamentally patriarchal. 
              Though an increasing number on the GBC are sympathetic in regard 
              to gender issues, the majority of members continue to resist change. 
              Even the formation of a Women's Ministry by the North American GBC 
              and temple presidents was criticised by many. How this important 
              issue is handled will undoubtedly affect ISKCON's future development 
              and growth. 
            <p>There has been increasing recognition of the need to develop relevant 
              social models for all the members of ISKCON. There may no longer 
              be squabbles between <i>sannyasis</i> and <i>grihasthas,</i> but 
              members of every <i>ashrama</i> are finding it difficult to fulfil 
              their specific duties amidst an increasingly materialistic society. 
              That as many as 50% of those who have taken <i>sannyasa</i> have 
              later abandoned their vows may indicate imperfect training as a 
              <i>brahmacaris</i> or an unfulfilled life as <i>sannyasis.</i> In 
              either case, ISKCON leaders will need to invest energy in developing 
              training programs for all, beginning with the youngest. And it is 
              with its youth that ISKCON faces what is perhaps its greatest challenge. 
            <p>ISKCON will continue to wrestle with knotty philosophical issues. 
              Splinter organisations, which began as Gaudiya Matha grafts, offer 
              nuanced understandings of Prabhupada's teachings. Though relatively 
              small in contrast to ISKCON's world-wide membership, their message 
              will continue to find a hearing in certain quarters. A far greater 
              challenge, however, will be interpreting the translations of authoritative 
              texts and commentaries as they are published and widely circulated. 
              The controversy regarding the origin of the soul is but one example 
              of what is likely to reoccur. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, the 
              publishers of Prabhupada's works, are studying the possibility of 
              training a team of translators who they feel assured will not deviate 
              from Prabhupada's conclusions. Yet scriptural statements are broad 
              enough, no matter how carefully they are translated to allow for 
              a wide spectrum of interpretation. No provision, no matter how carefully 
              prepared, can avoid diversity of opinion, as the history of every 
              religion testifies. 
            <p>A quick perusal of the heresies in this brief survey illustrates 
              the well-known truth that history repeats itself. Whatever heretical 
              issue Prabhupada resolved had to be dealt with again after his departure. 
              There is nothing to suggest that the future will be different. Yet 
              is seems equally certain that ISKCON will remain a cohesive respondent 
              in the face of each new challenge.
