            <p>NB. The footnotes for this article are linked to a separate <a href="5_1knottfoot.html">footnote</a> 
              page. 
            <p>In August and September 1965, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami made the 
              journey by sea from Calcutta to New York. As he neared his destination 
              in the ship, the Jaladuta, the enormity of his intended task weighed 
              on him. On 13, September he wrote in his diary, 'Today I have disclosed 
              my mind to my companion, Lord Sri Krishna (Goswami, 1980: 3). On 
              this occasion and five days later, Bhaktivedanta Swami called on 
              Krishna for help in two devotional poems composed in his native 
              Bengali. Reading the first of these intimate records of his prayerful 
              preparation for what lay ahead, we learn something of how Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami understood his own identity and mission: 
            <ul>
              <p>Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is unparalleled 
                in his service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. He is that great, 
                saintly spiritual master who bestows intense devotion to Krishna 
                at different places throughout the world. By his strong desire, 
                the holy name of Lord Gauranga will spread throughout all the 
                countries of the Western world. In all the cities, towns and villages 
                on the earth, from all the oceans, seas, rivers, and streams, 
                everyone will chant the holy name of Krishna . . . Although my 
                Guru Maharaja ordered me to accomplish this mission, I am not 
                worthy or fit to do it. I am very fallen and insignificant. Therefore, 
                O Lord, now I am begging for Your mercy so that I may become worthy, 
                for You are the wisest and most experienced of all . . . (Goswami, 
                1980: 277-8) 
            </ul>
            <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami, by journeying to America, was attempting to 
              fulfil the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of his dear 
              Lord Krishna. Five days later, docked temporarily in Boston, Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami revealed his anxieties still further upon encountering the 
              country in which he was to fulfil his guru's instruction and sow 
              his devotional message. Speaking directly to Krishna, he confessed: 
            <ul>
              <p>I do not know why You have brought me here. Now You can do whatever 
                You like with me. But I guess You have some business here, otherwise 
                why would You bring me to this terrible place?<br>
                How will I make them understand this message of Krishna consciousness? 
                I am very unfortunate, unqualified and most fallen. Therefore 
                I am seeking Your benediction so that I can convince them, for 
                I am powerless to do so on my own <br>
                O Lord, I am just like a puppet in Your hands. So if You have 
                brought me here to dance, then make me dance, make me dance, O 
                Lord, make me dance as You like. <br>
                I have no devotion, nor do I have any knowledge, but I have strong 
                faith in the holy name of Krishna . . . (Goswami, 1980: 283-4) 
            </ul>
            <p>Sharing with Lord Krishna his sense of hopelessness, Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami then surrendered to him, praying for his intervention in the 
              task ahead, offering only his own 'strong faith' in exchange. 
            <p>In addition to learning about Bhaktivedanta Swami's mission and 
              his devotional relationship to Krishna and his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati, in these poems we glimpse some aspects of his self-perception. 
              His was a Bengali Vaishnava perspective, a view of himself as fallen, 
              ignorant and lacking in devotion, as faithful to God and guru, but 
              in need of mercy. In his later talks and letters, he refers occasionally 
              to himself, his earlier life, his relationship to others and his 
              vision of the spread of Krishna consciousness, but his viewpoint 
              is wholly Vaishnava. He humbly presents himself to the West in parampara, 
              in disciplic succession, continuing the teachings of Krishna, the 
              sages and philosophers, Caitanya (Lord Gauranga), his followers, 
              and the later Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. 
            <p>The character, tone and mood of Bhaktivedanta Swami's devotional 
              relationship to Krishna and his guru are mirrored in his own disciples' 
              responses to him. This arises partly as a result of Vaishnava etiquette 
              concerning guru-disciple relationships, but also because of the 
              great love, respect and need for 'Srila Prabhupada', as he soon 
              became known, which quickly grew up among his close followers.<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#1">1</a> 
              I will look at this more closely shortly and will examine how if 
              differs from the perspectives on Prabhupada of those who were not 
              his disciples. In particular, I will consider scholarly responses 
              which, though respectful and admiring, generally arise from conceptions 
              of greatness, stature and achievement that differ from those identified 
              within Vaishnavism. 
            <p>All perceptions of Prabhupada are complex by virtue of his geographical, 
              social and cultural location. Seen from any perspective, he achieved 
              what no other Vaishnava teacher had accomplished-successfully preaching 
              devotion to Krishna worldwide. Geographically nomadic after sixty-nine 
              years living in northern India, the person of Prabhupada, and his 
              role and achievements have meaning in both Indian and Western contexts, 
              but also cross-culturally, in terms of the late-modern process of 
              globalisation. As I will show, devotees, no less than scholars, 
              have been able to make sense of this crucial aspect of Prabhupada's 
              significance. 
            <p>As a means of learning more about insider and outsider perceptions 
              of Prabhupada, I will consider three issues which have generated 
              responses to his person, role and achievements: the guru, books 
              and publishing, and the founding of ISKCON, an international missionary 
              movement. 
            <p><b>Prabhupada and the Role of Guru<br>
              </b>By the time Bhaktivedanta Swami first arrived in the United 
              States he had initiated but one disciple. He had little experience 
              of being a guru, but saw himself rather as 'an English preacher', 
              following the instructions of his own guru.<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              An early newspaper account described him as an 'ambassador of <i>bhakti-yoga</i> 
              . . . a slight brown man in faded orange drapes and wearing white 
              bathing shoes . . . a messenger from India to the peoples of the 
              West' (<i>The Butler Eagle</i> in Goswami, 1980:13). Like others 
              who met him, Bhaktivedanta Swami's appearance as well as his purpose 
              struck the journalist. Howard Wheeler, later to become Hayagriva 
              dasa, recorded his first impression: 
            <ul>
              <p>I first see him just after crossing the Bowery at Houston Street. 
                As he passes before the iron-mesh fence of a playground, I distinctly 
                glimpse the aura of saintliness. I watch him through the rushing 
                traffic and stumbling derelicts.<br>
                He strolls almost jauntily down the sidewalk. He is an old man 
                whom age has never touched. Aloof from the people and bustle about 
                him, he walks proudly, independently, his hand in a cloth bead-bag. 
                He wears the saffron robes of a <i>sannyasi,</i> and on his feet 
                are quaint, pointed white shoes. (Hayagriva dasa, 1985:1) 
            </ul>
            <p>As a young man who had spent time in India, Wheeler had correctly 
              identified Bhaktivedanta Swami as a <i>sannyasi.</i> Where he recognised 
              saintliness, other interested young people saw serenity, dignity 
              and refinement. In addition to his presence, they gained an impression 
              of him through his activities, his quiet chanting, his energetic 
              kirtana, his lectures, his cooking and his conversation (Goswami, 
              1980, chapter 6). Some tried to make sense of what they encountered 
              by linking the 'Swami' with other images and ideas they had acquired 
              about India and Indian religions, but, by his gradual instruction 
              and example, they learnt to appreciate his distinctiveness, his 
              difference from other Hindu gurus and Buddhist teachers. 
            <p>It was when Bhaktivedanta Swami suggested that he initiate some 
              of these early followers that Vaishnava teaching about the nature 
              and role of the guru began to emerge. To his anxious students the 
              Swami explained that the guru or spiritual master was God's representative 
              and accordingly worthy of worship and respect (Goswami, 1980:178-9). 
              He repeatedly reiterated and clarified this in later talks and conversations. 
              To hippies in San Francisco he stressed that, 'a guru is not some 
              pet, some fad . . . One must find the bona fide spiritual master 
              and surrender to him. That is the injunction of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>' 
              (Hayagriva dasa, 1985:150). His relationship with his own guru, 
              Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and the devotion and worship that followed 
              from it, also provided a means for devotees to learn about the meaning 
              of guru, and about their own Swamiji's humility. Michael Grant (Mukunda 
              Goswami), one of the Swami's earliest initiates, recalled him reflecting 
              on his own status, 'Actually, I am not a servant of God, I am trying 
              to be a servant of God' (Prabhupada, 1977:xiii). 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami's role as guru was also revealed in an interview 
              with an English journalist from <i>The Times</i> in 1969 in which 
              the latter, reflecting all the conventional wisdom about gurus, 
              enquired about what made a 'genuine' guru. Did followers have to 
              give money to the guru, to leave their jobs, or to live in the temple? 
              How could they know the difference between 'genuine' and 'fake' 
              gurus? 
            <ul>
              <p>The genuine guru is God's representative, and he speaks about 
                God and nothing else. The genuine guru is he who has no interest 
                in materialistic life . . . He is absorbed in the Absolute Truth 
                . . . He represents the Supreme Lord, just as a viceroy represents 
                a king. The real guru will not manufacture anything. Everything 
                he says is in accordance with the scriptures and the previous 
                <i>acaryas.</i> He will not give you a mantra and tell you that 
                you will become God in six months. This is not a guru's business. 
                A guru's business is to canvass everyone to become a devotee of 
                God. (Prabhupada, 1977:62). 
            </ul>
            <p>Through such exchanges, Bhaktivedanta Swami was able to teach his 
              disciples and interested outsiders what it meant to be a guru in 
              the Vaishnava tradition. He stressed the guru's relationship with 
              God, the scriptural authority for the guru and the guru's duties, 
              the link to previous <i>acaryas</i> or teachers, the avoidance of 
              manufacturing opinions, and the focus on bringing others to God. 
            <p>Not only have these teachings been instrumental in informing disciples 
              of the nature and role of the guru, but they have also given them 
              an interpretative framework for understanding the person and activities 
              of their own spiritual master. This is evident, for example, in 
              the morning lectures given by senior devotees in ISKCON and in the 
              published writings of scholar-devotees such as Satsvarupa dasa Goswami 
              and Ravindra Svarpa dasa. Steven J. Gelberg (Subhananda dasa) in 
              'ISKCON after Prabhupada', for example, wrote that Srila Prabhupada 
              'had tolerated no suggestion that he himself was any sort of divinity 
              or avatar' (1985:8), thus stressing his spiritual master's teaching 
              that as guru he was in no sense God. He continued, 'the guru's presence 
              is in his instructions, and in their execution is spiritually tangible' 
              (8), reiterating a vital point made by Prabhupada on many occasions 
              but principally before his death in 1977: 'I may stay or go, but 
              in my books I will live forever' (Goswami, 1983(a): 337). The guru 
              lives in his eternal instructions (<i>vani</i>), not in his transitory 
              body (<i>vapuh</i>).<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#3"> 3</a> 
            <p>In the years since his demise, this idea has been critical in how 
              Prabhupada has been perceived by those exposed to his teachings. 
              For those within ISKCON, in addition to the guidance of those gurus 
              appointed post-1977 to initiate disciples, there has been the instruction 
              of Prabhupada in his books, talks and letters. To those devotees 
              who have contested the authority of ISKCON's Governing Body Commission 
              to appoint initiating gurus and who have consequently left the movement, 
              Prabhupada remains the only 'living guru'. In a journal, <i>Back 
              to Prabhupada</i>, founded by some of these disciples, the authors 
              seek to establish his 'unique, pre-eminent and unrivalled position 
              as the saviour of mankind for the next ten thousand years' (<i>Prabhupadanugas</i>, 
              1995: frontispiece) and to challenge what they see as the usurpation 
              of his position by subsequent ISKCON gurus. <a href="5_1knottfoot.html#4">4</a> 
            <p>The debate about guru succession and the authority of Prabhupada, 
              not only as founder-<i>acarya</i> but as the continuing inspiration 
              for Krishna consciousness, has been central in ISKCON for many years 
              (Rochford; Shinn; Gelberg, 1985, 1988). In 1986, in a personal reflection 
              on his own position as guru, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami considered 
              the relationship between the new gurus and Prabhupada, noting particularly 
              their error of imitation: 
            <ul>
              <p>Prabhupada was the only example of a guru and <i>acarya</i> that 
                we knew, and so we assumed that whoever was a bona fide guru would 
                have to exactly imitate Prabhupada in every way. Thus the prayers, 
                titles, big vyasasanas, lavish guru-pujas and Vyasa-pujas, lavish 
                living quarters, the personal comforts. (35) 
            </ul>
            <p>We see in this that Prabhupada's important role as an exemplar 
              to be imitated went beyond that of Vaishnava etiquette and pious 
              <i>sadhana</i> or devotional practice to that of perfect spiritual 
              master worthy of worship.<a

 href="5_1knottfoot.html#5">5</a> It was only after a number of gurus broke the 
              principles of the movement and were removed from office in 1986 
              that an open and critical debate began about the position of the 
              gurus after Prabhupada and their relationship to him. The authority 
              and centrality of Prabhupada was reasserted after 1986. All devotees 
              were reminded of their eternal relationship with the founder-<i>acarya</i> 
              of ISKCON and the <i>guru-parampara.</i> The powers of the remaining 
              gurus were curtailed, and other suitably qualified devotees were 
              added to their number (Gelberg, 1988).<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#6">6</a> 
              There was recognition that Prabhupada's pious devotion and spiritual 
              qualification could not simply be acquired along with the role of 
              guru. These characteristics had to be attained by discipline and 
              devotional practice. 
            <p>In an evaluation of the nature of the guru, Larry Shinn, a scholar 
              of religions, utilised Max Weber's analysis of charisma in order 
              to understand Prabhupada and the issue of leadership in ISKCON. 
              He noted that 'Prabhupada profited from two intertwined sources 
              of authority' (1987:40), the traditional authority of the disciplic 
              lineage, <i>parampara,</i> inherited from his own guru, and his 
              own charismatic authority, derived from his spiritual attainment 
              and presence, and that Prabhupada's guru-successors had been able 
              to adopt 'his traditional role as initiating acarya but not . . 
              . his status as charismatic leader' (49). Shinn offered an analysis 
              based on sociological rather than spiritual (Vaishnava) authority 
              in order to make sense of the role of guru in ISKCON and the unique 
              qualities of Prabhupada. 
            <p>He offered a further observation on Prabhupada as spiritual master 
              by acknowledging that 'to critics outside ISKCON, Prabhupada may 
              be viewed as being all to human to be considered &quot;perfect&quot;' 
              (41). In doing this, he made the interpretative shift from the devotional 
              perspective of insiders (Srila Prabhupada as 'a perfect spiritual 
              master' and 'pure devotee') to the varied but non-devotional perspectives 
              of outsiders. In such views, while Prabhupada might be admired for 
              his achievements and spiritual discipline, or criticised, along 
              with other gurus, for leading young people astray, he would be identified 
              and presented as fully human. Neither scholarly nor anti-cult perceptions 
              take the same starting point on the issue of Prabhupada's authority 
              as devotees. He is examined for his human strengths and weaknesses. 
              Shinn described him as 'a sincerely religious old man' (42) who 
              made 'tactical and programmatic decisions he later would have to 
              retract' (41). Thomas Hopkins, who first met him in 1967, in his 
              Foreword to one of the volumes of Prabhupada's biography wrote of 
              it as 'a very human story with a very human Bhaktivedanta Swami 
              at the centre' (Goswami, 1980: xii). In anti-cult material, he and 
              other gurus have been classified as 'god-men', as egotistical, cruel 
              and exploitative of their followers (for example, <i>Gods of the 
              New Age</i>). 
            <p>Yet, while accentuating Prabhupada's humanity, a number of scholars 
              readily indicate his special qualities and achievements. Harvey 
              Cox identifies him as 'one in a thousand, maybe one in a million' 
              (Gelberg, 1983:40-1); Hopkins notes that Prabhupada's is 'an astonishing 
              story' (Gelberg, 1983:127). Others have used words such as 'stunning', 
              'remarkable' and 'extraordinary' to describe his work in spreading 
              Krishna consciousness in the decade before his death. 
            <p>These ideas - of Prabhupada's humanity and uniqueness, his sameness 
              and difference - derive from Western ideas (modern Christian and 
              liberal secular) about the nature of individual persons, their participation 
              in a common humanity but with their own unique value and character. 
              As a religious leader, Prabhupada has been evaluated by Westerners 
              outside the movement from this perspective, though recognition has 
              also been given - particularly by scholars - to the devotees' alternative, 
              spiritual interpretation of their guru's activities and role. 
            <p><b>Prabhupada, Books and Publishing<br>
              </b>As Srila Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death, 
              he would live forever in his books. He would remain present for 
              them as spiritual master by this means. What is more, the teachings 
              of the <i>guru-parampara</i> or lineage he represented would be 
              available to all. As author of some thirty books (including his 
              translations and commentaries on <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> in thirty 
              volumes and <i>Chaitanya-charitamrita</i> in seventeen volumes) 
              published almost exclusively during the last ten years of his life, 
              translated into many languages and distributed tirelessly by his 
              devotees around the globe, Prabhupada fulfilled his own guru's requests 
              that he print books and preach Lord Chaitanya's message around the 
              world. 
            <p>Srila Prabhupada had instilled in his devotees an understanding 
              of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard 
              to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples 
              felt Prabhupada had given them <i>Back To Godhead</i> for their 
              own writings, their own efforts at preaching (Goswami, 1980:247-50). 
              Prabhupada had first produced the English language magazine <i>Back 
              To Godhead</i> in 1944 in response to his guru's advice. In 1966 
              he passed this responsibility on to his own disciples. 'Don't be 
              dull. Write something', he encouraged them (250). 'You write your 
              realisation-what you have realised about Krishna . . . Whenever 
              you find time, write. Writing or offering prayers, glories-this 
              is one of the functions of a Vaisnava.' (Ravindra-Svarupa dasa, 
              1984: xiii). Through hearing Srila Prabhupada's words, the devotees 
              felt affirmed in using their creative and intellectual skills to 
              write about Krishna Consciousness. They saw Prabhupada inviting 
              them, not to speculate, but to record their experiences and to present 
              and represent the teachings of the Chaitanya tradition. They learnt 
              from him two key ideas, that the <i>parampara</i> to which they 
              belonged by virtue of their initiation was 'the <i>sampradaya</i>', 
              or spiritual tradition, 'of the book' (xiii), and that books were 
              the 'big <i>mridanga</i>' or great drum (Hayagriva dasa, 1985:195) 
              with the potential to transmit Krishna Consciousness worldwide.<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#7">7</a> 
            <p>A fellow Gaudiya Vaishnava, Shrivatsa Goswami, who as a young man 
              had met Prabhupada in India in 1972, affirmed the significance of 
              book publishing and distribution in spreading the message of Caitanya 
              in an interview with Steven Gelberg: 
            <ul>
              <p>Making these Vaisnava texts available is one of Srila Prabhupada's 
                greatest contributions. Apart from the masses, his books have 
                also reached well into academic circles and have spurred academic 
                interest in the Chaitanya tradition ... The significance of making 
                these texts available is not merely academic or cultural; it is 
                spiritual. <i>Jnana,</i> knowledge, is spread, proper doctrines 
                are made known, people come closer to reality. (Gelberg, 1983:247) 
            </ul>
            <p>With these words he looked inwards, to the values of Vaishnavism, 
              and outwards, to the interests of a wider academic culture, to locate 
              the importance of Prabhupada's writing. From the Vaishnava perspective, 
              his work spread the true teachings, enabling devotees to attain 
              to consciousness and love of Krishna; from the perspective of the 
              academy, it facilitated the study of an important tradition of Hinduism, 
              previously little known and under-researched. 
            <p>This second perspective has been noted by non-Hindu scholars too. 
              Thomas Hopkins, referring to the <i>Bhagavata Purana </i>and <i>Chaitanya-charitamrita</i>, 
              commented that Prabhupada 'has really made these and other major 
              texts of the Vaishnava tradition accessible in a way that they never 
              were before, and so he's made the tradition itself accessible to 
              the West' (Gelberg, 1983:140). Prabhupada's strength in doing so, 
              however, was not merely that he made important texts such as these 
              and the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> comprehensible to westerners, but that 
              he provided a traditional Vaishnava commentary upon them (140). 
              The texts were delivered in a particular devotional framework, thus 
              enabling a reader to see how the text could live for its devotional 
              community and how it could be applied to particular problems. Hopkins 
              thus confirmed that Prabhupada's aim was not simply to serve scholars 
              by providing new translations of key texts, but to make known a 
              particular interpretation of those texts through his commentaries. 
            <p>Hopkins and other western scholars of religion have given greatest 
              consideration to Prabhupada's approach in their analyses of his 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</i>. Both Hopkins and Edward Dimock have 
              reflected on the value of Prabhupada's translation and commentary, 
              neither doubting his scholarly skills but both indicating and appreciating 
              his devotional standpoint. Hopkins commented that his is 'the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              as seen through the perspective of the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>', 
              in which Krishna the charioteer is understood to be 'one and the 
              same as' the Krishna of Vrindavana (Gelberg, 1983:144). Dimock, 
              in his foreword to <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</i>, wrote that, 'in 
              this translation the Western reader has the unique opportunity of 
              seeing how a Krishna devotee interprets his own texts' (Prabhupada, 
              1982:v). Both of these scholars recognised the utility for Western 
              studies of religion of texts presented from within a living tradition. 
            <p>Other scholars have experienced more difficulty in appreciating 
              the value of a devotional standpoint, noting the negative aspects 
              of such an interpretative frame. Eric Sharpe identified Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami's interpretation as single-minded and fundamentalist (1985:141-7). 
              He saw <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</i> as a work of faith and Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami as a man who loved the <i>Gita,</i> but saw little virtue 
              in these characteristics, concluding that, '<i>Bhagavad-gita As 
              It Is </i>remains substantially an impression of what a particular 
              corner of the Hindu world imagines that it is' (146). Sharpe clearly 
              recognised Prabhupada's particular standpoint, but did not identify 
              the relationship between standpoints such as his and earlier <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              commentaries. Instead, he judged Prabhupada's scholarship according 
              to Western values, noting that he had failed to mention ambiguities 
              in the text and implying that he had misread the text in order to 
              establish his own devotional perspective (144-5). 
            <p>A. L. Herman also found Prabhupada's translation and commentary 
              problematic. He, too, identified its standpoint, and like Sharpe 
              referred to this as Krishna fundamentalism. Like Sharpe, he compared 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami's translation with other translations and found 
              it wanting, noting 'the curious and oftentimes embarrassing discrepancies' 
              (1991:139), the contrary definitions and reinterpretations. 
            <p>It is Robert Baird who has offered the most detailed exposition 
              and analysis by a western, non-Hindu scholar of Bhaktivedanta Swami's 
              translation and commentary. He located his account firmly in the 
              very issue raised here, of conflicting interpretative frameworks. 
              Succinctly, he wrote, 'the gulf between Swami Bhaktivedanta's presentation 
              and that of the scholarly exegete is unbridgeable, for their purposes 
              operate on different levels' (1986:200). Like Sharpe and Herman, 
              as a scholar trained in western critical practices, he distinguished 
              the <i>Gita</i> itself from its interpretations, such as <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              As It Is</i>. He did this, however, by acknowledging the different 
              interests and integrity of the academic and devotee, and by placing 
              himself firmly in the camp of the former. From his standpoint, he 
              then discussed Bhaktivedanta Swami's translation and commentary 
              as a didactic work, a declaration of Krishna Consciousness by a 
              guru in <i>parampara,</i> a guru for whom the text was revealed 
              truth. Baird, who as a western, non-Hindu scholar was unable to 
              share this perspective and, in fact, had quite different objectives 
              in understanding the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and Bhaktivedanta Swami's 
              interpretation of it, suggested that Bhaktivedanta Swami would have 
              condemned his own approach as one of 'speculative reasoning' (202), 
              opinion rather than truth received through the correct disciplic 
              tradition. Prabhupada noted this himself in his Preface to <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              As It Is</i>. Separating his intentions from those of 'so-called 
              scholars', he explained that it is his purpose to present <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              'without adulteration' (1982: viii). 
            <p>Despite the distance between the standpoints of Prabhupada and 
              such scholars, both parties have an interest in this last point. 
              Prabhupada's concern was to present the text 'as it is' (viii); 
              Baird noted that the historian's concern was a desire 'to understand 
              everything <i>that might be implied in the words of the text without 
              importing anything that is not actually there</i>' (201, my italics). 
              Neither party, apparently, wished to see the text adulterated, but 
              both had different ideas about the inherent meaning of the text. 
              Although there was considerable mutual respect between Prabhupada 
              and those scholars of religion who were in contact with his work, 
              the matter of scriptural interpretation seems to have been the one 
              which brought their fundamental differences of perspective most 
              clearly into view. 
            <p><b>Prabhupada, ISKCON and Mission<br>
              </b>Prabhupada inherited not only the call to print books but also 
              the motivating energy of the Gaudiya Math to spread Lord Chaitanya's 
              message to 'every town and village' (Goswami, 1982: xix). For this 
              purpose he had left India and gone west; for this purpose he had 
              established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              in 1966.<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#8">8</a> In this capacity, Prabhupada 
              was identified by his disciples not only as a guru following in 
              the same lineage as Chaitanya, but also as 'founder-<i>acarya</i>' 
              of ISKCON. In relation to both, he was seen as successfully fulfilling 
              Chaitanya's missionary prophecy of <i>sankirtana,</i> praising Krishna 
              in every town and village by his own travelling ministry and his 
              inspiration to others to do likewise. The opening of temples worldwide, 
              publishing of books in many languages, and touring of <i> sankirtana</i> 
              parties for book distribution and public chanting were all seen 
              as instrumental in the realisation of this prophecy. 
            <p>The evidence of his success in fulfilling the prophecy has been 
              vital for other Indians in formulating a view of Prabhupada. Charles 
              R. Brooks, in his account of the Hare Krishna movement in Vrindavana, 
              made clear that those who knew Bhaktivedanta Swami from his days 
              as a resident there before his journey westwards little suspected 
              that he would achieve the goals he had set himself. Seen variously 
              as 'a beggar', 'a bother', 'naive', but 'determined' (1989:75-6), 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami was not taken seriously by his neighbours. His 
              mission to America was seen as 'a child's fantasy-very innocent 
              but improbable' (75). Not surprising then that later, in 1982-3, 
              Brooks should find some of Prabhupada's old neighbours claiming 
              greater friendship with Prabhupada or more awareness of his spiritual 
              gifts than they had had in reality at the time of his residence 
              among them. With more honesty, one admitted: 
            <ul>
              <p>We were thinking: Why this old man has such fancy? He has no 
                disciples. He is old and lives as Vrindavana <i>sadhu,</i> so 
                he has reached life's goal. Why he was bothering with such fancy 
                dreams to only disturb his mind? Of course now we say, 'Oh yes, 
                Prabhupada is my good friend for so many years. I encouraged his 
                mission. I knew he was <i>mahatma</i> (great soul) and so forth.' 
                We were all fools. We could not see this old man was some future 
                <i>jagatguru</i> (world teacher)! (76) 
            </ul>
            <p>Prabhupada's return to Vrindavana with his western disciples and 
              news of the global spread of ISKCON led to a new respect and recognition 
              that Krishna had indeed been behind his success. 
            <p>One western scholar who knew Bhaktivedanta Swami from the time 
              of his own stay in Vrindavana in 1962 was Klaus Klostermaier. In 
              an article reflecting on the impact of the Caitanya movement in 
              America, he reminisced: 
            <ul>
              <p>Swami Bhaktivedanta, the later founder of the Hare Krishna movement, 
                was a frequent guest at our Institute. As Swami Bon's <i>guru-bhai,</i> 
                he used to visit us regularly and I had many conversations with 
                him. Years later, when I first heard of the Hare Krishna movement, 
                I was surprised to find my old acquaintance of Vrindaban days 
                to be the founder and guru of this rapidly expanding movement. 
                (1980:95) 
            </ul>
            <p>Although initially bemused by the fact that young modern, progressive 
              Americans were following the Swami and his Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings, 
              he came to realise the potential of the idea of God-consciousness 
              to capture the western imagination. 
            <p>Klostermaier and other commentators have noted that an earlier 
              attempt by a Gaudiya missionary to establish Caitanya's message 
              in the West had failed. Bon Maharaj, like Bhaktivedanta Swami after 
              him, had tried to fulfil the desire of his guru to extend <i>sankirtana</i> 
              beyond the shores of India. He had returned from England with only 
              one serious disciple to his credit. 
            <p>Thomas Hopkins has been keen to stress that the success of ISKCON 
              worldwide arose not only from Prabhupada's own efforts, but from 
              'the revitalised Chaitanyaite tradition that stemmed from Kedarnath 
              Dutt's efforts in the nineteenth century' (1989:49). Prabhupada 
              had inherited the impulse to preach from his own guru, Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati, the son of Kedarnath Dutt or Bhaktivinoda Thakura, as 
              he became known. As middle class Bengalis, both father and son were 
              influenced by the British administration in Calcutta, its English 
              educational system and its commitment to the medium of printing 
              for the dissemination of ideas. Both contributed to a repositioning 
              of Caitanya's prophecy in a modern context, and it was this that 
              led Prabhupada to success in the West. The comparison of Prabhupada 
              with Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's less successful disciples, however, 
              lead Hopkins to acknowledge 'his tremendous personal spirituality 
              and holiness, and his incredible determination' (Gelberg, 1985:127), 
              qualities which enabled him to succeed where others had failed.<a href="5_1knottfoot.html#9">9</a> 
            <p>Shivatsa Goswami added to these qualities those of boldness and 
              courage in his appreciation of Prabhupada's mission. As a Gaudiya 
              Vaishnava himself, he admitted that, 
            <ul>
              <p>When I reflect on Srila Prabhupada's achievement, I become a 
                sort of Hindu chauvinist. I am not ashamed of it. The process 
                initiated, rather imperfectly, by Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and 
                others was brought to its logical and ultimate end by spreading 
                and making 'Rama' and 'Krishna' household words throughout the 
                world. That is the greatest achievement . . . What the Muslims 
                could do only by the tremendous sword, and the Christians could 
                do only with great financial resources and state power, has been 
                done by one solitary man, without any ill effects. (241-2) 
            </ul>
            <p>What was most striking, according to Shrivatsa Goswami, was the 
              way in which this had been achieved in a materialistic, thus hostile 
              culture. 
            <p><b>Bridging the Cultural Gap<br>
              </b>Both Thomas Hopkins and Shrivatsa Goswami have located Prabhupada's 
              achievement firmly within its modern context by relating it to the 
              self-conscious revitalisation of Caitanya Vaishnavism in British 
              Bengal and the globalising strategy of other well-known neo-Hindu 
              figures. As both point out, Prabhupada has been noted for transplanting 
              a culturally specific form of Hinduism, though one stressing teachings 
              with potentially universal appeal. This in itself is surprising. 
            <ul>
              <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami has managed, successfully, to bridge an enormous 
                cultural gap and to give practical application to teachings that 
                were originally designed for people in a very different cultural 
                setting. That's not easy to do, by any means. (Hopkins in Gelberg, 
                142) 
            </ul>
            <p>Prabhupada's ability to bridge this cultural gap has been viewed 
              in varying ways by commentators. Many have seen this as an extraordinary 
              achievement, and have stressed Prabhupada's skill as a teacher and 
              his ability to catch the interest of a generation; others have chosen 
              to note his unwillingness to compromise, seeing this as a weakness 
              in the context of modernity. Scholars themselves have disagreed 
              on whether or not Prabhupada understood the scale and nature of 
              his global preaching mission, some seeing him as naive, others as 
              wise and commanding, though generally all have accepted the success 
              of his transmission of Vaishnavism in novel, social and cultural 
              milieus. 
            <p>Devotees have also been interested in making sense of this aspect 
              of Prabhupada's achievement. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami has seen this 
              as an attempt to unite two different worlds in Krishna Consciousness, 
              bringing benefit to both, bringing together 'the East's Krishna 
              conscious culture with the West's prosperity and technological advancement' 
              (1983(a): xvi), thus reiterating the cultural exchange proposed 
              by Vivekananda at the end of the nineteenth century. Michael Grant 
              (Mukunda Goswami) has focused on Prabhupada as an embodiment of 
              Indian Vaishnava culture in the West (Prabhupada, 1977:xiii). But 
              Ravindra-Svarupa dasa has noted Prabhupada's skilful use of 'innovation' 
              in negotiating a successful form of Vaishnava practice and organisation 
              for the West. With reference to chanting, <i>ashrama</i> (stages 
              of life), worship and women, he has shown the adjustments that Prabhupada 
              made to enable his mission to take hold and become popular in a 
              very different religious and social context (1989:73). Prabhupada 
              had to tread a fine line between intransigence and compromise in 
              transplanting Krishna Consciousness. Remaining true to the teachings 
              of the <i>guru-parampara</i> was imperative, while at the same time 
              being receptive to differences in context. Ravindra-Svarupa dasa 
              has presented a founder-<i>acarya</i> who was sensitive to these 
              matters, aware of the need to bridge a cultural divide between India 
              and her religious traditions, and 'the alien Manhattan streets' 
              (1984:48), but without adulterating or reinterpreting his inheritance. 
            <p><b>Conclusion: Perspectives from Inside and Outside<br>
              </b>That those inside and outside ISKCON have drawn broadly different 
              conclusions on the nature and significance of the person of Prabhupada 
              and his activities in not in itself surprising. Generally, for devotees 
              inside the movement, Vaishnava theology and etiquette provide the 
              lens through which to view the 'spiritual master', 'pure devotee' 
              and 'founder-<i>acharya</i>'; for those depicted in this examination 
              as outside the movement, the secular liberal lens stresses Prabhupada's 
              humanity at the expense of his spiritual significance. Furthermore, 
              scholarly outsiders, using modern, textual-critical strategies read 
              Prabhupada's translations and commentaries not as <i>shastra,</i> 
              scripture, presented unadulterated to a new audience by a bona fide 
              guru, but as a modern, devotional interpretation of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              in the <i>Mahabharata.</i> Even Prabhupada's success in transplanting 
              Krishna consciousness and expanding ISKCON worldwide has a different 
              meaning to insiders and outsiders. For the former, it represents 
              the fulfilment of prophecy: for the latter, the highly successful 
              and opportunistic engagement of a particular religious tradition 
              with the modern process of globalisation. 
            <p>Such insider and outsider standpoints have their own logic and 
              integrity, their own objectives, tenets and values (Rosen, 1992; 
              Knott, 1993). For Baird, with regard to <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</i> 
              at least, the gap between the devotional insider and the scholarly 
              outsider views is 'unbridgeable', one open to esoteric interpretation 
              and the other closed to its possibility (1985:201). 
            <p>Identifying such differences of view can be helpful in understanding 
              where a key religious figure, like Prabhupada, or a text, symbol 
              or tradition, is positioned in both religious discourse and discourse 
              about religion. A case study in which this complementarity is exemplified 
              is the book edited by the devotee-scholar Steven J. Rosen (Satyaraja 
              dasa) in which he discusses aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism with 
              historians, sociologists and textual critics of religion. As he 
              affirms, however, we should beware of overstating the distinction 
              between different perspectives. It is clear that there is sufficient 
              diversity in the views of both insiders and outsiders-as witnessed 
              above by scholars on Prabhupada on the <i>Gita</i> and devotees 
              on Prabhupada as cultural bridge-to challenge any temptation we 
              might have simply to polarise these perspectives into two opposing 
              camps. As Katherine Young has pointed out, 
            <ul>
              <p>... our terminology of 'insider' and 'outsider' is out of date. 
                This is true because our 'insiders' are also 'outsiders'. In addition 
                to their experience as devotees, their understanding draws from 
                historical and philosophical studies, and they use the language 
                of the modern academic disciplines. Also the 'outsiders' are, 
                in a way, 'insiders' in that they have studied traditional Vaishnava 
                religion with phenomenological appreciation of this form of spirituality 
                and perhaps have discovered analogies with their own religious 
                experience. Thus, today, the comparative perspective of 'insider' 
                and 'outsider' has a new complexity . . . (1985:29) 
            </ul>
            <p>This 'new complexity' is visible in the selected perceptions of 
              Prabhupada presented above. In addition to devotional views among 
              insiders, there are also critical, theological insights provided 
              by 'devotee-scholars'. And among the perspectives of outsiders, 
              there are those that favour empathy and those that depend on critical 
              distance. This 'new complexity' is, on the one hand, spurred on 
              by the nature of the study of religion as a scholarly practice and, 
              on the other, by the need and interest of contemporary religious 
              movements like ISKCON to negotiate the secularising and globalising 
              processes of modernity. 
            <p>Although Prabhupada was aware of such processes and had his own 
              ways of confronting them, there can be little doubt about his own 
              perspective on the meaning of his life and work: He was the most 
              fallen creature and the founder-<i>acarya</i>, the servant of the 
              servant and the guru worthy of worship, the disciple of his guru 
              and the guru of his disciples. His was the view of a Gaudiya Vaishnava 
              in all its traditional complexity.
