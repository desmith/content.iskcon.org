                from a morning walk at Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, in July 1975. 
                'Ten thousand years' refers to the belief that the advent of Sri 
                Caitanya inaugurates a golden age lasting ten thousand years within 
                the normally dark age of Kali. <br>

              <li><a name="3"></a>Shinn believes succession was not the issue: 
                'The burning issue for ISKCON in the aftermath of Prabhupada's 
                death was not that of succession: it was a traditional disciplic 
                line which his own designates and gurus appointed later could 
                fit. Rather, the problem was how his personal authority to interpret 
                scriptures, to decide future courses of action for the society, 
                and to solve personal and institutional problems could or would 
                be institutionalised.' (Shinn, 1987 p.50) Ravindra Svarupa agrees 
                with Shinn if 'succession' merely refers to initiating new disciples 
                (though some ISKCON members found this a particularly contentious 
                issue). The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (4:1-4) clearly mentions the 
                principle of disciplic succession, and Prabhupada affirmed this 
                fundamental concept throughout his teachings. But if 'successor' 
                is understood as the spiritual head of an institution, this was 
                precisely the issue that threatened to divide ISKCON after Prabhupada's 
                demise. <br>

                1967. Prabhupada considered his other disciples' response 'regrettable,' 
                and ordered that they send a letter of regret and apology for 
                their mistake. He made it clear that he had only ordered that 
                Kirtananda not be permitted to speak; he had never banned him 
                from the temple. <br>

                each bearing lists of disciples under the heading 'G. B.,' an 
                abbreviation for Governing Body. At the time we naively speculated 
                that these 'G.B.' scraps were in fact predestinarian lists of 
                the elect, Going Back to Godhead. <br>

                conduct its affairs constitutionally, though at the time no rules 
                of order were followed in any meetings. Shortly after this incident, 
                a modified version of 'Robert's Rules of Order' was introduced 
                and, over the years, tailored to fit ISKCON's ecclesiastic needs.<br>

                in America </i>(see Rochford 1991:283-6). Varied interpretations 
                of these tapes became the basis for a heated debate concerning 
                whether Prabhupada intended for those he named to become regular 
                gurus and accept their own disciples after his demise, or whether 
                Prabhupada would continue to accept the new disciples even after 
                his death (See 'The <i>Ritvik acarya</i> Heresy'). <br>

                for their leaving, a major cause was the concerns expressed in 
                Pradyumna's letter. <br>

              <li><a name="17"></a>Some ISKCON leaders were quick to demonise 
                Sridhara Maharaja, especially when he began to re-initiate disciples 
                of ISKCON gurus. After many years of virtually no official contact, 
                the GBC sent a representation to the elderly Vaishnava shortly 
                before he passed away to apologise for any offences they had committed.

                owing to a suspension of normal rules while each GBC member (other

                correction by a fifty-person committee. Not all of the original 
                gurus could commit themselves to the changes demanded. During 
                the previous year three were victimised by sensual fall-downs 
                and left ISKCON in disgrace, perhaps discouraged by their loss 
                of prestige and influence, or simply weakened by the years of 
                extravagance. A fourth, Kirtananda Swami, was excommunicated along 
                with his followers for failing to submit to the new changes. The 
                GBC was down to fifteen. The new additions brought it up to strength 
                again. <br>
                Excommunication in ISKCON generally carries with it a proviso 
                for re-instatement when certain conditions are met. The excommunicated 
                member is not permitted to participate in ISKCON activities. Yet 
                the examination order does not imply that the severed member cannot 
                make advancement spiritually by practising Krishna Consciousness 
                on his own, though it is thought that his progress will be hindered 
                without the association afforded through the society. After his 
                excommunication, Kirtananda experimented with inter-faith practices, 
                incorporating many Christian influences into Vaishnava worship 
                procedures. As these changes took place following his and the 
                community's disassociation form ISKCON, the GBC did not concern 
                itself with these matters. Hence, these experiments do not fall 
                within domain of this paper.<br>

              <li><a name="19"></a>At present, the number of gurus has expanded 
                to nearly 100. There were other changes to insure Prabhupada's 
                central position: a permanent seat in each temple alone would 
                honour him, and no other guru would be allowed the public use 
                of the title <i>acarya.<br>
                <br>
                </i>&nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="20"></a>During the first of the 'appointment' meetings 
                of 1977 Prabhupada told this author with regard to ISKCON leadership, 
                ' No one of you alone but all of you together.' <br>

              <li><a name="22"></a>&nbsp;The recent official GBC paper entitled 
                <i>'Disciple of My Disciple'</i> (see, dasa, B., et. al. 1997) 
                is largely concerned with demonstrating that this theory is more 
                correctly a proxy-initiation theory. Included in the paper is 
                the research of GBC member and Sanskritist Hridayananda dasa Goswami: 
                'The significant point here is that terms such as <i>ritvik-guru 
                </i>and<i> ritvik-acarya </i>simply do not exist. There is no 
                such term in any Sanskrit dictionary, nor in any recognised Vedic 
                literature, to my knowledge. There is no such term because there 
                is no such concept. In other words, our friends are proposing 
                something that does not exist in Vedic culture. This is the main 
                problem with it.' To avoid the unnecessary confusion which would 
                arise were we to refer to the same debate in two dissimilar ways, 
                we will use 'proxy-initiation' to describe the issue.<br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="24"></a>In 1996, two more gurus renounced their disciples, 
                expressing inability to maintain their vows. One was the highly 
                respected retired GBC Minister of Education. Their resignation 
                adds fresh fuel to the proxy-initiation debate.<br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="26"></a>The first brahminical initiations were held 
                in Boston in August 1968, the second in San Francisco in September 
                of the same year.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="27"></a>Standards for awarding brahminical initiation 
                have gradually tightened over the years, though temples which 
                experience a shortage of priests, may be more lenient in recommending 
                a candidate for initiation.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="28"></a>We may wish to recall that Prabhupada's original 
                GBC included no <i>sannyasis.</i> His 'Direction of Management' 
                specifies their duties: 'The <i>sannyasi</i> will travel to our 
                different centres for preaching purposes as well as enlightening 
                the members of the centre for spiritual advancement. The <i>sannyasis 
                </i> will suggest for opening new centres in suitable places and 
                the GBC will take action on it.' (Prabhupada 1970) Prabhupada 
                initially envisioned a different role for the sannyasis, but managerial 
                necessity dictated otherwise.<br>

              <li><a name="30"></a>&nbsp;This is a translation of a text from 
                the <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrita, Madhya-lila</i> 8.128.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="31"></a>Prabhupada wanted to be certain that he had 
                uprooted any remnant of the <i>grihastha-sannyasi </i>conflict. 
                As the leader of the principal <i>sannyasi</i> party, this writer 
                was called to his room and ordered to leave the party and go to 
                preach in the Orient. Having just been elected Chairman of the 
                GBC, this writer thought it would be better to send a non-GBC 
                member away. 'Why not GBC?' Prabhupada demanded. 'All your resolutions 
                are finished. First resolution, then revolution, then dissolution 
                - no solution! I have to manage everything myself! I give you 
                a little power, and you create havoc! GBC is for solving situations, 
                not for creating situations... Now I take everything from you. 
                You can either go, or you simply sit here in Mayapur and chant!' 
                (dasa, H. 1992: vol. I: 458). My excuses shattered, I bowed my 
                head, conceding to my guru's desire. (Prabhupada may have resolved 
                the immediate conflict but gender bias continues to haunt ISKCON-see 
                'Concluding Remarks.') <br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><i><a name="32"></a>Rasika-bhakti</i> refers to devotion guided 
                by <i>rasa,</i> or taste. It is used here in the context of spontaneous 
                devotion (<i>raganuga-bhakti</i>) as opposed to devotion generated 
                from following rules (<i>vaidhi-bhakti</i>).<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="33"></a>While the impact of Narayana Maharaja on devotees 
                residing within the ISKCON temples is minimal, he has created 
                a significant following among independent devotees not under any 
                direct ISKCON authority. His visit to Australia attracted many 
                persons who no longer felt inspired by the ISKCON leadership. 
                The fact that ISKCON is bracing itself in anticipation of his 
                next world tour indicates that ISKCON is both concerned and affected 
                by what goes on in the wider circle of devotees residing outside 
                its immediate temple communities.<br>

              <li><a name="34"></a>GBC Resolution 79 of 1995. See, Goswami, H. 
                d., 1996:186-7.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="35"></a>This policy has forced the GBC to select less 
                suitable candidates for particular assignments, often with dire 
                consequences. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="36"></a>This is not the first time the GBC has attempted 
                to add a secondary body of assistants. The previous experiment 
                some 10 years ago was quickly abandoned. But senior devotees are 
                ageing, and this along with their increased responsibilities may 
                guarantee these new deputies' continued participation. In addition, 
                a grand-disciple of Prabhupada was selected as an 'assistant' 
                GBC, a preliminary appointment that usually leads to full-fledged 
                GBC status.</li>
