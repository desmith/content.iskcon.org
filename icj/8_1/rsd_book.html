            <p>Today, confessing members of any particular religious tradition 

              are apt to find themselves in a context of 'multiple otherness'. 

              That is to say, we practise our own faith within the dominating, 

              framing milieu of a highly energised secular culture - one that 

              is, at best, indifferent to our religious quest. At the same time, 

              within that secular framework we find ourselves constantly thrown 

              together in civic, social or vocational activities with a diverse 

              assortment of committed members of other faith communities. The 

              outstanding merit of Keith Ward's <i>Religion and Human Nature</i> 

              is its thorough and serious engagement with this context of 'multiple 

              otherness'. Thus it attains a relevance to the condition of all 

              of us - contemporary believers across the lines of faith - vouchsafed 

              to a few works of confessional theology. </p>

            <p>Preceded by <i>Religion and Revelation </i>(1994) and <i>Religion 

              and Creation </i>(1996), <i>Religion and Human Nature</i> is the 

              latest contribution to a pioneering and ambitious endeavour undertaken 

              by the current Regis Professor of Divinity at Oxford University. 

              The project is in a way quite traditional - a fully articulated 

              Christian systematic theology - and each volume embarks on a traditional, 

              well-worn path of theological inquiry. Yet Professor Ward's approach, 

              as exhibited in <i>Religion and Human Nature</i>, sets off into 

              startling new territory simply by taking the current human context 

              so seriously (and perhaps offering thereby an implicit statement 

              of what constitutes 'human nature'). Professor Ward's nicely wrought 

              union of the traditional and the contemporary constitutes a notable 

              attraction of this work.</p>

            <p>Keith Ward organises the views of human nature and destiny found 

              in various religions according to a typology of doctrinal 'strands' 

              (a metaphor introduced originally, I believe, by Ninian Smart) and, 

              selecting specific traditions to represent the various types, the 

              author engages the representative traditions not only by means of 

              study and reflection, but also by active participation and dialogue.</p>

            <p>Readers of this publication will find it of particular interest 

              that:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>From the 'pure spirit' strand I have chosen, to represent 

              the 'many self' view, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 

              (ISKCON). To some people in the West, this may seem like a rather 

              outlandish sect of young people who dance in groups along city streets, 

              chanting 'Hare Krishna'. Such chanting is indeed central to the 

              practice of this group, but the organisation is part of a major 

              Indian religious group, the Bengali Vaishnavas, or worshippers of 

              the god Vishnu. The group is one of a number of <i>bhakti</i>, or 

              devotional groups. ... As such, it has a good claim to represent 

              what is one of the most widely practised sets of religious beliefs 

              in India. It is committed to the view that each individual soul 

              has an eternal existence, without beginning or end, and that the 

              supreme goal of every soul is to be released from the material world 

              and live an endless life in Goloka, a purely spiritual realm beyond 

              birth and death. (p. 7)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Keith Ward was one of the participants of the Vaisnava-Christian 

              Conference, co-sponsored by ISKCON Communications Europe, in January 

              1996. This meeting provided him with material for this work and 

              me with the pleasure of his personal association. As a result, I 

              can attest from first-hand experience to the depth and sincerity 

              Professor Ward brought to his encounter with my tradition. </p>

            <p>I find little to criticise in his extremely clear exposition of 

              Gaudiya Vaisnava teachings and practices, to which he dedicates 

              the whole of Chapter 3, 'The Search for the Self (Vaishnava Hinduism)', 

              although, I would have wished the sentence, 'For Gaudiya Vaishnavas, 

              just chanting the <i>Mahamantra</i> is sufficient to ensure entry 

              to Goloka after death', to have had the word 'purely' or 'offenselessly' 

              inserted after '<i>Mahamantra</i>'<i>.</i> However, Professor Ward 

              immediately goes on to note the importance of 'ascetic discipline' 

              in devotional service, although the nature of the relation between 

              such discipline and the quality of chanting is not brought out.</p>

            <p>In dealing with other traditions of Indian provenance, Professor 

              Ward examines the 'one self' version of the 'pure self' strand, 

              as exemplified in the neo-Vedanta of Svami Vivekananda, and the 

              'no-self' strand as exemplified in several Buddhist traditions. 

              It is quite illuminating and thought-provoking to follow a perceptive 

              Christian scholar (who espouses a version of the 'embodied self' 

              strand typical of the Abrahamic faiths) as he analyses these various 

              views of human nature and assesses them in relation to each other. 

              We are all led to think more deeply about what we believe and perceive 

              through our beliefs, and to think critically about what difference 

              it all makes.</p>

            <p>All the traditions of Indian origin share an adherence to some 

              version of the doctrine of karma and transmigration, and it is to 

              this particular complex of ideas that the author devotes some extended 

              analysis and critical inquiry, resulting in an exposition of a variety 

              of 'difficulties' with the idea of rebirth (Chapter 4, 'The Doctrine 

              of Rebirth'). Against this, Professor Ward develops his own version 

              of the traditional Semitic 'embodied self' outlook. In Ward's 'soft 

              emergent materialism', the distinctively spiritual attributes of 

              a human being emerge through evolutionary process. This teaching 

              is consonant with a traditional Christian 'embodied self' view of 

              human nature, and, according to Professor Ward, it has the advantage 

              over the Indian views, of being supported by the findings of modern 

              science, particularly those of genetics and neurophysiology. ('If 

              reincarnation is true,' he asserts, 'a great many modern scientific 

              theories on the nature and functioning of the brain and the development 

              of the human embryo must be false' [p. 70].) This chapter should 

              provide adherents to the teachings of karma and reincarnation with 

              an invigorating stimulus to produce a stronger and more complete 

              exposition of the teachings. We must not underestimate the value 

              of good critics.</p>

            <p>In spite of his difficulties with the idea of transmigration, Professor 

              Ward sees much religious value in the Gaudiya Vaisnava 'soterial' 

              understanding of karma and rebirth: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Nevertheless, the idea of rebirth does enshrine a hope 

              for the possibility of spiritual progress and development, even 

              for those whose earthly lives seems to make such a hope impossible. 

              That is a hope that must be basic for any religion of devotion to 

              a truly gracious and loving God, and there must be some way of providing 

              for it in any religion of grace. Even if the hypothesis of rebirth 

              is rejected, that hope is one of the things that Gaudiya Vaishnavism 

              has to teach the Christian tradition. (p. 75)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>As far as the concept of human nature is concerned, the most fundamental 

              divide seems to be between the traditions of Indian, on the one 

              hand, and those of Near-Eastern origin on the other. For example, 

              in discussing Buddhist teaching, Professor Ward remarks:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Buddhist analyses of human nature share with most Indian 

              traditions a theory of mentalistic causation which underlies the 

              possibility of karma and rebirth. Such a theory is common to virtually 

              all forms of Indian religion, whether they are one-self, many-self, 

              or no-self in form. The Indian traditions contrast, in this respect, 

              with the Semitic traditions, which have no doctrine of rebirth, 

              and which regard material, bodily existence as having much more 

              causal importance in their analysis of human nature. (p. 111)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>In spite of the fact that the Vaisnava and the Christian views 

              of human nature are rooted in opposite sides of this fundamental 

              divide, their conceptions of the final human destination, Professor 

              Ward discovers, tend - unexpectedly - towards convergence.</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Gaudiya Vaishnavism cannot, therefore, place a uniquely 

              high value on the individual personality as it exists in this embodied 

              world of human history. Such a value can only belong to the self 

              which is never born and never dies, and which is not to be identified 

              with any particular historical embodiment. However, the devotional 

              doctrine of the reality of Goloka Vrindavana, the supreme home of 

              Krishna, and of the transcendental delights which exist there, means 

              that there exists a variegated world, without suffering or pain, 

              in which souls find their highest fulfillment in loving devotion 

              to Krishna. Such a view converges on the view often held in Semitic 

              religious traditions that there will be a resurrection of the person 

              to a transfigured spiritual world, without suffering. When the released 

              self is not a purely disembodied consciousness of bliss and intelligence, 

              as in Sankhya thought, there is not a vast difference from those 

              doctrines of the resurrection of the body which stress how different 

              and more perfect the resurrection body is from the present material 

              body. Surprising as it may seem, Vaishnava belief in the eternity 

              of the soul is not vastly different from some Semitic beliefs in 

              the resurrection of the body (p. 49).</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>The ground covered by <i>Religion and Human Nature</i> falls very 

              naturally and neatly into the three components of Vedantic knowledge 

              as understood by Gaudiya Vaisnavism (see, for example, <i>Sri</i> 

              <i>Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila</i> 7.146). They are <i>sambandha</i>, 

              or correct knowledge of God, the conscious beings and the world 

              in their mutual relationships; <i>abhidheya, </i>acting according 

              to one's proper relationship (this includes understanding the ways 

              and means of deliverance); and <i>prayojana</i>, knowledge of the 

              final destination. It will be interesting to try to account for 

              the way that such an apparently great difference in <i>sambandha</i>, 

              as<i> </i>between Christianity and Gaudiya Vaisnavism, can come 

              to be coupled with a <i>prajoyana</i> 'not vastly different'. If 

              we think of <i>sambandha </i>as a map of what there is, <i>abhidheya 

              </i>as a travel route through the territory covered by the map, 

              and <i>prayojana</i> as the desired destination(s), then I suspect 

              we shall have to look at all three components together in detail 

              to work towards an answer to the question of what difference ideas 

              of human nature, as elements of <i>sambandha</i>, make.</p>

            <p><i>Religion and Human Nature</i> is a work that should lead us 

              all forward. There is a great co-operative task ahead for theologians 

              of all traditions. Keith Ward's work is an inspiring, pioneering 

              first instalment of that great task, to which he invites us to contribute: 

              'The properly comparative theology to which this [work] is meant 

              as a contribution will only exist if members of many traditions 

              contribute together to continue such a growth in understanding, 

              each expounding their own tradition in the light of a genuine encounter 

              with others' (p. 9).</p>

            <p>I urge thinkers in ISKCON to take up Professor Ward's gracious 

              invitation and to follow in his footsteps.</p>
