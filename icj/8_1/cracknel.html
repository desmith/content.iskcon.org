            <p><i>Interfaith relations have been a positive feature in ISKCON's 

              development in the past decade. In this paper, Kenneth Cracknell, 

              a key participant in this dialogue, reviews the history of ISKCON 

              in its relationship with other faiths, particularly Christianity. 

              He takes us from a time of mutual suspicion between ISKCON and other 

              faith groups to a present where dialogue has led to mutual understanding, 

              appreciation and, often, a deepening of faith on both sides. He 

              examines the issues involved from many perspectives ranging from 

              the institutional to the personal and from the theological to the 

              practical. </i></p>

            <p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (hereafter 

              ISKCON, or the Society) is increasingly putting other communities 

              of faith in its debt because of its recent contributions to the 

              theory and the practice of interfaith dialogue. At the theoretical 

              level it has recently published its guidelines statement, 'ISKCON 

              in Relation to People of Faith in God', and is currently engaged 

              in soliciting responses to these. The Society's scholarly periodical, 

              the <i>ISKCON Communications</i> <i>Journal</i>, Vol. 7, No. 2, 

              carries eight important commentaries from members of other faith 

              communities, each of which is a contribution to further theorising 

              about the nature of interfaith dialogue. But the production of 'guidelines 

              on dialogue' is not the beginning of dialogue. Far from it. The 

              Society has, in a relatively short period of time, acquired a very 

              respectable amount of practical experience in interfaith dialogue, 

              and the new guidelines most certainly reflect ISKCON's energetic 

              and wholehearted engagement in this field. As a Christian observer 

              of ISKCON's life and development, and as a frequent participant 

              in the dialogues, I want to pay tribute to all who have been involved 

              in this activity.</p>

            <p>It was, of course, not always so, and I therefore use the phrase 

              'relatively short period of time' advisedly. Only a decade ago, 

              the devotee overseeing ISKCON's interreligious relationships was 

              lamenting the paucity of opportunity for genuine encounter between 

              Christians and his community. He mentioned particularly the lack 

              of officially sponsored interfaith conferences and symposia, pointing 

              to the absence of any official exchanges of monastic personnel, 

              the lack of co-operative humanitarian ventures, and the absence 

              of joint declarations on the moral and political issues of the day. 

              'There have been, to be sure', he wrote, 'critiques, assessments, 

              constructive and non-constructive criticisms, reactions, condemnations 

              and testimonials, but little serious, patient, face-to-face, soul-to-soul 

              dialogue.' (Gelberg, pp. 138-9, 155)</p>

            <p>The reasons for this state of affairs from the Christian side are 

              complex and varied. Perhaps the most obvious is the suspicion with 

              which ISKCON was treated in the earliest years of its existence. 

              Notwithstanding a long and honourable historical pedigree as part, 

              generically, of the great Indian <i>bhakti </i>movement, and, specifically, 

              as a Vaisnavite tradition tracing its roots to the Bengali religious 

              reformer Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1534), ISKCON was seen at best 

              as a 'New Religious Movement' (hereafter NRM) and at worst a 'cult'. 

              This latter term, still, alas, in use among the uninformed, carries 

              with it notions of brainwashing, forcible detention, bizarre belief 

              systems, and megalomaniac leadership, and gave rise to the sinister 

              activities of the self-styled 'deprogrammers'. The anti-cult groups 

              for a short time gained the ears of politicians, and, both in Europe 

              and the United States, considerable efforts were made to limit, 

              if not to proscribe altogether, NRMs of whatever kind. Unhappily 

              the mission of ISKCON's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada 

              (1896-1977), to the West coincided exactly with the outburst of 

              anti-cult activity in the 1960s and 1970s, and the new devotees, 

              dressed in their Indian costumes, attracted an inordinate amount 

              of pejorative attention. Dialogue with ISKCON could not happen until 

              this particular climate changed.</p>

            <p>This happened in or about the years 1984 to 1986. From the European 

              point of view, 1984 signalled a sea change in the way in which ISKCON 

              was viewed. In that year the anti-cult movement overreached itself 

              by persuading an obscure British member of the European Parliament 

              in Strasbourg to instigate a series of proposals which would control 

              all new religious movements, opening them up to inspection by religious 

              health authorities and limiting their freedom to make converts. 

              Unfortunately these 'Cottrell proposals' would also have had the 

              effect of infringing the liberties of all older religious movements 

              like the Churches and would have been in direct violation of the 

              articles on religious liberty of the Universal Declaration of Human 

              Rights and of the European Convention on Human Rights. National 

              Councils of Churches throughout Western Europe were appalled and 

              protested strongly. The Strasbourg Parliament retreated from the 

              brink of making a serious misjudgement. Similar concerns were being 

              felt by people in the USA and again the leadership of the 'anti 

              anti-cult' movement fell to staff members of the National Churches 

              of Christ of the USA, assisted by many brilliant academic students 

              of religion, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Thus the time was 

              right for the World Council of Churches, together with the Lutheran 

              World Federation, to hold a major consultation on New Religious 

              Movements in Amsterdam in 1986. This gathering committed itself 

              to the proposition that dialogue has no limits. NRMs were as much 

              to be seen as dialogue partners as the venerable ancient faiths 

              of the world.</p>

            <p>One result of this struggle to deal justly with followers of NRMs 

              on the part of the Christian establishment in the mid 1980s was 

              that many of us became welcome invitees to the headquarters of these 

              movements. So it was that I made my first visits to Bhaktivedanta 

              Manor, and a few months later to the ISKCON centres in Ireland. 

              For me, this meant a discovery of the deep spiritual life of the 

              devotees, of their practical ecological concerns and of the ability 

              of the Krsna message to transform former drug addicts and even people 

              who had been caught up on either side of Ireland's culture of violence. 

              I remember, too, sharing in an encounter between devotees and members 

              of a nearby Cistercian monastery, and their mutual discovery of 

              each other's traditions. But I was not alone in these experiences, 

              and at this time a series of scholarly and unprejudiced books and 

              articles appeared, correcting the one-sided propaganda of the anti-cult 

              movement.</p>

            <p>Yet there was one other major obstacle to be overcome before Christians 

              could throw themselves wholeheartedly into dialogue with Gaudiya 

              Vaisnavas. This lies in the history of Christian-Hindu relations 

              in general. Both Catholic and Protestant scholars of Indian religions 

              have preferred to acknowledge the monistic or non-dualistic school 

              of Sankara, known as Advaita Vedanta, as the essence or highest 

              development of Hinduism. For them this was the school most truly 

              representative of Indian philosophy and therefore the one with which 

              Christianity had most to reckon with.</p>

            <p>To be sure, these scholars were well aware of the existence of 

              devotional and theistic traditions within Hinduism. Yet a certain 

              intellectual distaste seems to have crept into their description 

              of the <i>bhakti </i>paths. On the Protestant side, the early twentieth 

              century Scottish Presbyterian missionary to India, Nichol McNichol, 

              seems to have set the tone for this, describing Krsna worship as 

              'incurably idolatrous', as 'sensuous' and as 'lacking a content 

              of revelation' (McNichol). This judgement was reinforced by the 

              leading missiologist of that period, Hendrik Kraemer, who asserted 

              that the <i>bhakti </i>versions of Hinduism were 'exclusively individualistic 

              and essentially eudaimonistic' (Kraemer, p. 160). In similar vein, 

              leading Catholic writers have described <i>bhakti </i>as being a 

              mere preparation for the 'higher', more universal Hinduism of Advaita. 

              Henri Le Saux (Abhishiktananda) and Bede Griffiths were widely perceived 

              as seeking to reconcile Advaitic thought with Christian spirituality.</p>

            <p>But there was always a paradox in this position, for such writers 

              often felt that Advaita needed the corrective of 'personalist' understanding 

              of both God and the human soul. Thus Bede Griffiths once wrote that: 

              'Christians have to show the Hindu in the light of our faith, that 

              in the ultimate experience of God, the absolute being, the world 

              and the soul are not lost, nor is the personal being of God absorbed 

              in the impersonal Godhead.' (Griffiths, p. 173) Griffiths writes 

              here as though he had never heard of Ramanuja, Vaisnavaism's outstanding 

              theologian.</p>

            <p>Other students of India, and indeed Christian missionaries and 

              their converts in India, knew better, and I cite first the work 

              of the German Protestant theologian Rudolph Otto. He wrote in 1930 

              of India's religion of grace, which affirmed a salvation that is 

              'offered to all and to the "poor in spirit" in particular'. This 

              salvation, he wrote, 'comes not by mystic experience, by the loss 

              of personality in the impersonal primal cause of all being, but 

              by <i>bhakti</i>, that is by surrender in simple, trusting appropriation 

              of the "grace" of the "Lord" and in love to Him'. This salvation 

              is the free gift of grace and is given through 'the saving might 

              of the Lord'. Otto declared that in 'this Indian <i>bhakti </i>religion 

              there is presented, without a doubt, a real, saving God, believed, 

              received and - can we doubt it? - experienced.' (Otto,<i> </i>pp. 

              16, 18, 21). </p>

            <p>Otto's scholarly perceptions were those of the Methodist missionary 

              and early dialogue pioneer, E. Stanley Jones, who recorded the words 

              of a Bengali <i>gosvami</i> at one of his round table conferences 

              in the 1920s: 'I believe in Sri Caitanya. I practise both <i>bhajana</i> 

              ... and <i>kirtana</i>. ... I feel that God is very near me. I have 

              this experience almost every time I have <i>kirtana</i> in the morning. 

              The name of Hari gives happiness.' (Jones, pp. 30-1). Bishop A.J. 

              Appasamy, an Indian church leader in the 1920s, wrote of the <i>bhaktas 

              </i>'who speak of God, adore His goodness, worship Him with bowed 

              heads and clasped hands as seeking in all possible ways to establish 

              a relation with Him which will grow into a mystic union.' Appasamy 

              believed that only such people could appreciate the inner spirit 

              of Christianity and the inner spirit of India's religious thought. 

              (Appasamy, pp. 2, 21).</p>

            <p>It seems that it took nearly sixty years for most of us to wake 

              up to the implications of such sentiments. Could it really be that 

              our best partners in Christian-Hindu dialogue are those of the <i>bhakti 

              </i>traditions? Could we not, from our Christian point of view, 

              deem it as providential that Srila Prabhupada so brilliantly preached 

              among Westerners? Might we not say that God has, through this man's 

              teaching, raised up a new generation of interpreters of <i>bhakti 

              </i>devotionalism? Could this not even be a new kairos, or turning 

              point, in the long and chequered history of Christian-Hindu relations?</p>

            <p>It will be no surprise to learn that my own answers to these far 

              from rhetorical questions are positive. I offer the following eight 

              reasons why Christians should rejoice to see this day.</p>

            <p><b>(1) The willingness of our partners:</b> It is striking how 

              much material written in the 1980s, and even before, by ISKCON devotees 

              demonstrates a yearning to contribute towards mutual understanding 

              of Christians and Vaisnavas. We may note two important and scholarly 

              articles from this time. In 1986 Kenneth Rose asked 'Has ISKCON 

              Anything to Offer Christianity Theologically?' (<i>ISKCON Review 

              2</i>, 1986). Though at that time no longer a member of the Society, 

              Rose affirmed that Christians can find a tradition 'no less vivid 

              and profound than Christianity, in which an Absolute providence 

              is experienced in a variety of personal relationships'. Dialogue 

              with this tradition might persuade Christians to lay aside 'the 

              proud and false claim of having, along with Judaism, the only historical 

              and scriptural relationship with God'. If we were to do that, perhaps 

              we might be better able to contribute towards a world theology of 

              God's universal redemption. </p>

            <p>Similarly, Steven J. Gelberg, writing as Subhananda Dasa, was moved 

              to write 'An Invitation to Dialogue' directed to the Catholic Church 

              in 1986 (<i>The Catholic Church and the Hare Krsna Movement: an 

              Invitation to Dialogue</i>). This was a response to an official 

              'Vatican Report on Sects, Cults and New Religious Movements', in 

              which this sentence appears: 'There is generally little or no possibility 

              of dialogue with the sects.' Subhananda Dasa marshalled all his 

              considerable rhetorical skill to refute such a view as it might 

              be applied to ISKCON. He particularly wished to stress the benefits 

              that might come to the Catholic Church through this dialogue, and 

              we shall take up some of his points shortly. He equally forthrightly 

              laid out some answers to the question 'What's in it for ISKCON?' 

              The benefits to ISKCON, he suggested, were four-fold. ISKCON members 

              would be enabled to confront religious pluralism; would learn from 

              the Catholic Church's broad history; would receive constructive 

              criticism, and, overall, the dialogue would serve as a 'reminder 

              to take deeply to the contemplative side of religious life'.</p>

            <p>Since Rose and Gelberg's responses, the <i>ISKCON Communications 

              Journal</i> has published many personal testimonies of devotees 

              who are excited by the notion of interfaith dialogue, especially 

              with Christians. I take but two examples. Ranchor Dasa reflected 

              in 1993 that it was sad that ISKCON had gained a reputation in many 

              circles for being a 'type of fundamentalist organisation, always 

              on the lookout for converts and self-advancement.' 'I do not believe', 

              he wrote, 'that this is what Prabhupada wanted of us. Nor do I believe 

              it is what we ourselves originally chose. Many devotees, like me, 

              came to Krsna consciousness because it embodied the universal principle 

              of Love of God in a way which embraced, not excluded, other religions.' 

              (Ranchor Dasa, 1993) Like many others in ISKCON, Ranchor Dasa is 

              a former Roman Catholic, but sees himself not as converted away 

              from Roman Catholicism, but rather sees himself as having built 

              on his original faith. The Christian church remains for him a holy 

              place 'where I intuitively feel at home'. For him, as for many others, 

              the dialogue is internal as well as external, and it is a joy to 

              speak about Jesus and Krsna in the same discourse.</p>

            <p>Other devotees have come rather more slowly to their commitment 

              to dialogue, especially those of Jewish or secularist backgrounds. 

              A report from one of the earliest residential interfaith conference 

              records Vaisnavas as being moved by the 'openness and humility of 

              all the members of the Christian churches present', and indeed some 

              expressed not a little amazement at the 'lack of false ego' in these 

              participants. They expressed gratitude for the 'real willingness 

              to understand' the Vaisnava philosophy. According to this report, 

              several devotees said that they had discovered a real increase in 

              'respect, appreciation and esteem' for Christians and Christianity, 

              calling the conference time 'essential and extremely productive 

              work'.</p>

            <p>As a result of this groundswell of concern on the part of devotees, 

              the ISKCON Interfaith Commission was formed in 1995. We know that 

              we do indeed have willing partners for the dialogue.</p>

            <p><b>(2) The accumulating experience of Christian-Vaisnava dialogue:</b> 

              When the first initiatives on the part of ISKCON were received by 

              members of the Christian community in the mid 1990s, there was a 

              ready response. Thus the very first of a now considerable series 

              of residential meetings, which was held in Wales in January 1996, 

              drew a distinguished group of Christian participants - church leaders, 

              university teachers, interfaith experts, clergy and laypeople, all 

              exceedingly busy people - to discuss 'The Nature of the Self.' Why 

              was this so easily achieved? As I wrote at that time, it had dawned 

              on all of us that the scholars and sages of ISKCON were highly trained 

              and immensely acute exponents of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, so much so 

              that they could represent the highest form of that philosophy extraordinarily 

              well to their fellow Westerners. We were to have the opportunity 

              to discuss with these men and women ideas and concepts with which 

              we were more or less familiar through our reading and study. We 

              were eager to learn from those who embodied these teachings in their 

              life and practice.</p>

            <p>This pattern has now been repeated on many different occasions 

              in the United States. In September 1996, in East Freeport, Massachusetts, 

              nine Christian theologians, Catholic and Protestant, devoted a weekend 

              to speaking with Vaisnava scholars and other devotees about 'The 

              Destiny of the Soul.' In April 1998, a similar group of nine devotees 

              and nine Christians met for the first time in Potomac, Maryland, 

              this time focusing upon 'The Everlasting Soul.' In September 1999, 

              a new group from the Detroit area met with the theme 'The Millennium 

              and Beyond: Christian and Vaisnava Perspectives'.</p>

            <p>In each case a momentum has been created which has led to further 

              engagements. In the Boston area a group of lay people (rather than 

              scholars) is carrying the dialogue. The Maryland group has met each 

              year since 1998, and its rapporteur has commented, 'There is something 

              to be said for continuity in a dialogue group; this session seemed 

              to build upon the mutual trust and affection of previous years. 

              There was rich personal sharing as well as fruitful intellectual 

              investigations: not only learning about or from one another but 

              learning with, as well.' (Trapnell)</p>

            <p>It appears that we have found a formula that works. In every case 

              there has been the warm, open-hearted hospitality of ISKCON devotees 

              as the hosts (necessarily so, since only they could prepare their 

              delicious Vedic food). In every case there have been excellent scholarly 

              presentations. I may mention the names of Keith Ward, Klaus Klostermaier, 

              Peter Phan and John Saliba on the Christian side, and Tamal Krsna 

              Goswami and Ravindra Svarupa Dasa on the Vaisnava side, to give 

              some indication of the quality of this input. But the main ingredient 

              has always been the readiness of all participants to listen and 

              to share their spirituality and their worship. Michael Barnes once 

              commented of his experience of this dialogue that 'it was one of 

              those rare occasions when head and heart seemed somehow to be united', 

              and his fellow Jesuit Francis Clooney speaks elsewhere of the Massachusetts 

              meeting in 1996 as 'a rich and complex event.' We turn now to explore 

              why heads and hearts have been so united, and the reason for such 

              richness and complexity.</p>

            <p><b>(3) A community of learners and teachers:</b> However paradoxical 

              it may seem to some, Christians and Vaisnavas draw very close to 

              one another because of their sense of mission. At the heart of each 

              faith is a sense that it bears good news for everyone. We are all 

              preachers with a Saviour to commend. It is this devotion and commitment 

              that we recognise in one another. At the same time, each of our 

              theologies recognises that God has come to other men and women in 

              different modes and forms. In Christianity, we look to the teaching 

              of God's universal wisdom, and speak of Spirit or Logos Christologies. 

              The sense that Christ will have spoken within other religious traditions 

              is increasingly common among us. In any case, we are called to be 

              obedient to the Holy Spirit who is Lord of all things. Only through 

              the Holy Spirit are people led to God. We are not in control of 

              conversions! For their part, Gaudiya Vaisnavas teach that all souls 

              are created by and are eternally related to Lord Krsna, regardless 

              of religious or cultural orientations. We have learnt that conversion 

              in Vaisnava tradition depends on the assumption that Krsna, not 

              the missionary devotee, is Isvara, the controller. Such teachings 

              give space for others to be themselves, and indeed Gaudiya Vaisnavism 

              in its Indian context has always recognised religious diversity 

              as normal and healthy. Furthermore, though some Indians do define 

              Hinduism as a religion of birth, Vaisnava tradition has almost always 

              had a more universalistic outlook, welcoming non-Indians and non-Hindus 

              into its fold for hundreds of years. In these ways, Gaudiya-Vaisnava 

              teachings support dialogue and co-operation with other religious 

              traditions.</p>

            <p>But we Christians may also recognise a new factor, namely that 

              ISKCON is the first global Vaisnava movement that is just now coming 

              to understand its vocation to enable Westerners to understand Indian 

              philosophy and spirituality. Since the ISKCON devotees are for the 

              most part Westerners themselves, they have a unique opportunity 

              to ensure a true understanding of Vaisnavism in the West. For our 

              part, we must open up all doors so that as many Christians as possible 

              take advantage of such opportunities of learning.</p>

            <p>In this, Christians need not be fearful that it would be just a 

              one-way process. The ISKCON guidelines make it clear that they, 

              too, feel they have much to learn about Christian life and practice. 

              But it is not only the guidelines that make this plain. It is the 

              devotees' already well proven receptiveness to their Christian guests. 

              Julius Lipner, for example, reports on a visit to Radhadesh, the 

              ISKCON centre in Belgium, for a communications seminar in which 

              he describes a 'genuine openness':</p>

            <p>I was taken in friendly trust and I rejoiced in that honour. I 

              was free to go where I wished, to converse with whomsoever I desired, 

              to say whatever I wanted ... the devotees themselves seemed to shake 

              off all constraints, as if realising the significance of the opportunity. 

              In a communications seminar, it was vital to communicate, to reach 

              out one another, to grasp the moment and to shape the future. (Lipner, 

              p. 22)</p>

            <p>Julius Lipner demonstrated his own ability to speak his mind as 

              he challenged the Society to face the problems of the status and 

              role of female devotees, and to consider the place of children in 

              the Movement. But we who have taken part in formal dialogue sessions 

              have also sensed a willingness to be challenged not just about practice 

              but also about belief.</p>

            <p><b>(4) A dialogue into mutual theological challenge:</b> The consultations 

              in Wales, in Massachusetts, in Maryland and in Detroit have all 

              demonstrated this openness. Here, as one example of readiness to 

              reconsider apparently entrenched positions, is a listing of questions 

              thrown up by the Welsh weekend:</p>

            <p> 

            <ul>

              <li>How central to Vaisnava philosophy is reincarnation?</li>

              <li>Can reincarnation never be on the Christian agenda and can Vaisnavas 

                do without it on their agenda?</li>

              <li>What do we mean by eternity?</li>

              <li>Will all souls be liberated, or is it possible that some souls 

                never gain liberation?</li>

              <li>What happens at the resurrection?</li>

              <li>What is the relationship between, and the nature of the body, 

                the soul, and the subtle body?</li>

              <li>What is the distinction between the subtle body and the 'I' 

                we identify with?</li>

              <li>What is it that remains and experiences things after the liberation?</li>

              <li>What is the kingdom of God?</li>

              <li>Is there an end of time or is time cyclical?</li>

              <li>Does the 'new heaven/new earth' encompass a corporate liberation 

                or is it purely individual?</li>

              <li>How does the concept of reincarnation and spiritual equality 

                fit in with our observation of the caste system?</li>

              <li>If we consider that the soul is not separate from the body, 

                do we not lose out on a socio-political dimension in our dealings 

                with others? Does that view not make us anthropocentric? Does 

                it not impact upon ecological implications of stewardship?</li>

              <li>How do Vaisnavas speak of death to others?</li>

              <li>What sort of bedside language would we use in comforting a dying 

                person?</li>

              <li>What is our pastoral approach to death? Is that different if 

                we were counselling a child or an old person? </li>

            </ul>

            <p>That such questions were raised indicates an unusual level of trust. 

              That such questions, and many others, remain on the agenda offers 

              a serious programme for both our communities well into the future.</p>

            <p><b>(5) A mutual stimulus to dedication in worship and spirituality:</b> 

              Intense interest in each other's forms of worship and spirituality 

              has also marked the recent Christian-Vaisnava dialogues. Indeed, 

              it has repeatedly been demonstrated on both sides of the Atlantic 

              that theological dialogue cannot proceed fruitfully without the 

              participants also drawing on the communal and personal religious 

              resources of their traditions. Gavin de Costa puts this well in 

              his commentary on the dialogue conference in Wales: 'I was particularly 

              struck by the way in which European ISKCON devotees were bound together 

              in their liturgical celebration. Whether in Sanskrit or Bengali, 

              they knew their songs of devotion and chanting, and danced for Krsna 

              in a beautiful and moving fashion,' and later reflects that he had 

              learnt much in theory and practice that 'commends a less paper-giving 

              orientation to such gatherings'. The opportunity to see each other 

              at prayer and play makes for a wholeness of our encounter. Francis 

              Clooney also notes the profound drawing together in the dialogue 

              community when we turn together to God in worship. His record of 

              the Boston meeting notes how all participants 'seemed to thrill 

              to God's grace running through us when we prayed and sang together 

              the Christian verse:</p>

            <p align="center"><i>When we've been there ten thousand years,<br>

              </i><i>Bright shining as the sun,<br>

              </i><i>We've no less days to sing God's praise<br>

              </i><i>Than when we'd first begun.'</i></p>

            <p>Such experiences truly enable Christians and Vaisnavas to speak 

              heart to heart and remind both traditions of the importance of the 

              contemplative side of spiritual life. As Steven Gelberg wrote some 

              years ago, 'For devotees in a highly activistic missionary organisation 

              like ISKCON, the active, "busy" side of institutional life can come 

              to overshadow (and in some cases almost eliminate) the interior 

              and contemplative aspect of spiritual life without which external 

              activity becomes unreflective, mechanical and self-centered.' He 

              thought then that the systematically introspective and contemplative 

              life, such as that found in Catholic monasteries, could act to remind 

              devotees of the critical necessity of devotional reflection and 

              prayer in the life of Krsna consciousness. We Christians, too, are 

              no less likely to fall into an over-active busy-ness.</p>

            <p><b>(6) Dialogue for the sake of the world:</b> One significant 

              result of the Christian-Vaisnava dialogue is the recognition (sometimes 

              to the surprise of both parties) of a common concern for this world. 

              To be sure, neither of us would have a sense of evangelistic mission 

              if we were not profoundly moved by the lost soul of humanity. Jesus 

              expressed concern for the 'sheep without a shepherd', and Srila 

              Prabhupada and the <i>sampradaya</i> (or religious tradition) he 

              represents is profoundly compassionate to all those men and women 

              who have no sense of God and the joy that brings. The atheistic 

              materialism of the West needs to be challenged at all levels. This 

              was the message, too, of the Vaisnava <i>acarya</i> Bhaktivinoda 

              Thakura (1836-1914), who taught that the enemy of Vaisnavism is 

              not other religious tradition, but atheism. Here Christians and 

              Vaisnavas can draw very close.</p>

            <p>But we realise it is no easy task to restore faith in God to Western 

              societies, and we have shared in our dialogues a sense that we need 

              each other as we challenge the West's prevailing values. Klaus Klostermaier 

              points to some of the findings of the first Massachusetts meeting 

              when he writes: </p>

            <p>Both Vaisnavas and Christians have to rethink their traditional 

              teachings on the background of contemporary psychology and neuro-science, 

              and have to restate their metaphysics in a contemporary idiom. They 

              must recognise the historico-cultural conditioning of traditional 

              teaching without giving up the timeless insights expressed in them. 

              Vaisnavism was always perceived to be close to Christianity in its 

              theology and its ritual practices. It may be possible to find a 

              common language to speak about the soul and its destiny that could 

              religiously inspire late-20th-century women and men. (Klostermaier, 

              p. 83).</p>

            <p>Now that the century has turned, it seems the urgency is even greater. 

              We have a new millennium before us. We may profoundly hope that 

              the new initiative in Oxford, England will take us more deeply into 

              new thinking for the sake of the world.</p>

            <p><b>(7) A dialogue towards a world theology:</b> This is the year 

              of the death of Wilfred Cantwell Smith (b. 1916), one of the great 

              Christian thinkers about interfaith relationships. In a seminal 

              paper about the study of comparative religion written as long ago 

              as 1959, Smith described the traditional form of Western scholarship 

              as being 'an impersonal presentation of an "it"'. But then came 

              a great innovation, what he called the 'personalization of the faiths, 

              so that we find a discussion of a "they"'. 'Presently', he continues, 

              'the observer becomes personally involved, so that the situation 

              is one of a "we" talking about a "they". The next step is a dialogue 

              when "we" talk to "you". If there is listening and mutuality, this 

              may become that "we talk" <i>with </i>"you".' (Smith, pp. 31-58) 

              At that point dialogue partners are saying to each other, 'This 

              what we have seen of the truth, this is what God has done for us; 

              tell us what you have seen, what God has done for you.' It appears 

              that 'we Christians' and 'we Vaisnavas' have undoubtedly attained 

              this stage. But there is one further stage to move towards. In Smith's 

              terms, it is when 'we all' are talking with each other about 'us', 

              and when we are able to formulate the beginning of a theology which 

              talks about the same Lord's dealings with all his servants, the 

              same parent dealing with all his or her children throughout world 

              history.</p>

            <p>Perhaps religious people in general are far from being able as 

              yet to construct a world theology. But if such a theology were ever 

              to come into being, certainly those Christians and Vaisnavas who 

              have drawn close to each other will be among the great catalysts 

              of a radical change in humanity's understanding of itself in the 

              next millennium. When that day comes, we will rejoice to see how 

              God has been dealing with the whole of humanity.</p>

            <p><b>(8) For the sake of friendship - dialogue as an absolute value:</b> 

              We have tried to list some of the reasons for engaging in interreligious 

              dialogue. We have seen among its benefits the dissipation of religious 

              narrow-mindedness, the breaking down of insularity, and the destruction 

              of xenophobia. We have emphasised that the increased understanding 

              of another religious tradition must in itself lead to the development 

              of a more introspective and critical approach to one's own faith, 

              and a deepening of one's own spirituality. We have stressed, too, 

              that dialogue heightens the awareness of, and appreciation for, 

              God's universal saving grace. Yet there is one last thing to be 

              said. It is this: that interfaith dialogue has its absolute value 

              and should be engaged in for its own sake. Dialogue is about friendship, 

              the highest human aspiration, as the mid-twentieth century British 

              philosopher John Macmurray wrote: 'All meaningful knowledge is in 

              order to action, and all meaningful action is in order to friendship.' 

              Both communities have sensed this, rightly so, for the theology 

              on both sides sees love as the essential attribute of God. Thus 

              the ISKCON author and teacher Ranchor Dasa entitled his presentation 

              to an Interfaith Conference at Bhaktivedanta Manor in 1994 'Searching 

              for the Dearest Friend', and he movingly portrays the relationship 

              with God in this terminology (Ranchor Dasa, 1994). Christians remember 

              the words of Jesus, as recorded in St John's Gospel, 'Henceforth 

              I call you not servants, for a servant does not know what his lord 

              does, but I have called you friends, for all things that I have 

              heard of my Father I have made known to you.' (John 15.14) If Christians 

              are friends of Jesus, it follows that we are friends of all people. 

              Devotees speak in the same language and the 'Principles' of the 

              new ISKCON guidelines are explicit, in that the friends of Krsna 

              are honest, truthful, respectful and tolerant in personal relationships: 

              'We can live without the philosophy, the ritual and the institution, 

              but we cannot live without our loving and serving relationship with 

              Krsna and His devotees.' By extension this, as Ranchor Dasa makes 

              plain in a second article, means friendship with followers of other 

              ways and paths in what Srila Prabhupada called 'a league of devotees.' 

              (Ranchor Dasa, 1993) It is, for many of us, a sign and a wonder 

              of the new era of interreligious relationships that deep and true 

              friendships have been formed between Vaisnavas and Christians. May 

              this new century see this friendship grow and increase.</p>
