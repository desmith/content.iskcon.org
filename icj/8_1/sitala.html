            <h4><b><span class="maintextsubhead">Presentation by</span> <a href="biodata.html#sita" class="maintextsubhead">Sitala 
              Dasi</a></b></h4>

            <p>Many of you may be wondering what this women's presentation is 

              all about. So, before setting the scene, I would like to assure 

              you what this presentation is not about.</p>

            <p>.           It is not about promoting feminism.</p>

            <p>.           It is not about disregarding Vedic culture.</p>

            <p>.           It is not about accusing, complaining or blaming.</p>

            <p>.           It is not about women versus men.</p>

            <p>What it is about is looking at ISKCON's social history, specifically 

              from the female perspective, for if we cannot clearly understand 

              the mistakes of the past, we cannot successfully move forward to 

              a healthy future. I would like to read a portion of an article written 

              by Thomas Hopkins in the <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i><a href="#1d"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="1"></a>,<sup> 

              </sup>where he describes the importance of ISKCON studying its own 

              history:</p>

            <p>There is a tendency in ISKCON today, however, to look on Prabhupada 

              and his teachings as a source of proof-texts for ad-hoc policies 

              and decisions rather than try to understand him and the tradition 

              in which he stood more systematically. In what may seem a paradoxical 

              way, it may be necessary to pay less attention to specific statements 

              that Prabhupada made in order to preserve the vitality of what he 

              stood for. Prabhupada himself was constantly changing - not in his 

              essential beliefs and devotional relation to Krsna, but in the decisions 

              he made to meet new circumstances and take advantage of new opportunities. 

              Prabhupada was a living person, and it was his personal application 

              of devotional principles that gave life to ISKCON rather than any 

              one teaching or even the whole body of his teachings.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, it is his teachings and the memory of his living 

              presence that ISKCON now has to rely upon, along with - and he would 

              certainly be the first to say this - the guidance of Krsna, the 

              Divine Godhead. How does one use these properly to keep ISKCON a 

              vital tradition? The answer certainly is not to use them in bits 

              and pieces to support decisions made for more materialistic or egocentric 

              reasons. It is rather to approach Prabhupada, his teachings and 

              the tradition in which he stood - the tradition of Caitanya Vaisnavism 

              as mediated through earlier scriptures and the teachings of Bhaktivinoda 

              Thakura and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati - in a more systematic manner 

              to provide a dialogue with the past on behalf of the future. [...]</p>

            <p>The purpose ... of ISKCON History is rather to maintain a continuous 

              check of the present against the core values and essential doctrines 

              of the larger tradition and the spirit of the founder. It is, in 

              other words, to keep the bright light of trained and devout attention 

              on the way the Lord's human agents are presenting His teachings 

              and managing His affairs.</p>

            <p>So this presentation is about:</p>

            <p>.           Sharing our realisations and experiences of the last 

              thirty years.</p>

            <p>.           Generating deeper understanding between leaders and 

              the people they lead.</p>

            <p>.           Seeking balance, working towards social sanity.</p>

            <p>.           Expressing our love and concern for Srila Prabhupada 

              and his movement.</p>

            <p>.           Protecting Srila Prabhupada's legacy for future generations 

              (we will not be around that much longer).</p>

            <p>.           Addressing the difficulties in our human relationships. 

              This is not exclusively a women's issue. We are all suffering due 

              to the lack of deep loving relationships, and the fragmentation 

              of our society is proof of this. We have a long way to go in living 

              our philosophy.</p>

            <p>.           It is also about encouraging a shift in emphasis from 

              buildings and institutional concerns to emphasising the importance 

              of appreciating, valuing and encouraging all individual devotees.</p>

            <p>Finally, I would like to humbly request that during these presentations 

              we all try to step out of our own autobiography - to set aside our 

              own glasses and really try to see the ISKCON world through the eyes 

              of others. Make it an exercise in empathic listening - in trying 

              to understand - for not seeking to understand will lead to judgement, 

              rejection and manipulation, whereas seeking to understand will lead 

              to understanding, acceptance and participation. We really have no 

              other choice. To survive in these difficult times we must focus 

              on what unites us, not what divides us.</p>
