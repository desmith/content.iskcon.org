            <p><i>For the past quarter of a century Burke Rochford has studied 

              ISKCON. His research has been appreciated for its thoroughness and 

              honesty by those inside and outside of ISKCON. In this, his latest 

              report, based on a presentation made at the North American GBC Meetings 

              earlier this year, he steps outside his normal role of a social 

              scientist and gives a more personal and very direct analysis of 

              ISKCON, its past, present and future. He expresses strong concerns 

              about the ability of the GBC to act effectively on behalf of ISKCON's 

              membership and in the general interests of Prabhupada's movement.</i></p>

            <p>I want to make four statements that I hope will provide a basis 

              for serious discussion. Before I do, I<i> </i>would like to make 

              several preliminary comments. I feel the need to do so because the 

              statements I make may seem overly harsh to some. I have been researching 

              ISKCON for half my life. I recently turned fifty, and in the fall 

              I will have been studying ISKCON almost continuously for twenty-five 

              years. In a real sense, I have grown up with ISKCON. I have made 

              lifelong friends. I consider some of these devotees to be my brothers 

              and sisters because our relationships are that close and that caring.</p>

            <p>While ISKCON has provided research opportunities and friendships, 

              it has also been a basis for my own admittedly limited spirituality. 

              I see and feel Krsna working in the world. I turn to Him when things 

              go bad and even when things go unusually well in my life. I pray 

              that He will intervene in the lives of all people in the world who 

              are forced to endure suffering. I feel His presence when I am in 

              the temple and in the midst of <i>kirtana </i>wherever it happens 

              to take place. Sometime back, a colleague who studied and wrote 

              a book on Rajneesh mentioned something to me that I have never forgotten 

              because it rings so true with respect to my relationship to ISKCON. 

              He said very simply, 'You know, Burke, I really wanted them to succeed. 

              I was really pulling for them.' But, as we know, Rajneesh did not 

              succeed in Oregon, and apart from the centre in Poona, India, the 

              movement is now largely composed of scattered networks of members 

              in North America and elsewhere. </p>

            <p>The fact is, I want ISKCON to succeed. I want my many devotee friends 

              not only to find salvation for themselves but also to build communities 

              that represent an alternative to mainstream culture, an alternative 

              that other people can become part of.</p>

            <p>One of your members mentioned to me recently that he thought the 

              GBC would, within a few years, become responsive to the needs of 

              ISKCON's membership. He said that things took time, that membership 

              in the GBC body was beginning to change and there was hope in the 

              not too distant future. I told him, and I say to you now, that this 

              is not good enough. It is not good enough because, as each year 

              passes, many of my friends and many devotees whom I know only slightly 

              or not at all are being hurt by an organisation that remains unable 

              to respond to the real needs of real people. </p>

            <p>While I have always been willing to express my opinion, I have 

              in many ways held back in my discussions with the GBC as a formal 

              body. I have expressed my honest thoughts to individual GBC members 

              but have always felt it a foolish move to challenge the GBC or the 

              leadership as a whole, and certainly not in a public way - thereby 

              potentially being seen as politically motivated. I do not see myself 

              acting politically here, although I fully realise that what I say 

              has political significance. At fifty I find it easier to speak about 

              my version of the truth because the personal fallout from doing 

              so means far less to me today than it did ten, fifteen or even twenty-five 

              years ago, when I challenged my old friend Danavira, who was then 

              head of the Bhakta Programme (a training programme for newcomers) 

              in Los Angeles. (At the time I was a <i>bhakta </i>in his programme 

              for research purposes, although Danavir never saw my presence there 

              in those terms. He knew why I was 'really' there.) </p>

            <p>I am not a malcontent. But I am also not going to sidestep the 

              questions facing ISKCON because they are difficult and because some 

              members of the GBC may not like what I have to say. I am simply 

              too old to worry about these things any longer.</p>

            <p>So I present here my four statements, with some elaboration. My 

              hope is for us to talk as friends, as brothers and sisters, who 

              may respectfully disagree. My effort is not meant to make any of 

              us defensive. In fact, I am really interested in developing a solid 

              strategy that will benefit devotees and ISKCON itself.</p>

            <p><b>(1)</b> <b>I have come to the conclusion that even if (a) ISKCON's 

              problems are identified precisely and (b) real, practical and viable 

              solutions are proposed, the GBC body lacks the foresight, resources 

              and authority to act on behalf of ISKCON's membership and in the 

              best interests of Prabhupada's movement.</b></p>

            <p>Let me be more specific.</p>

            <p><i>(a) Social organization. </i></p>

            <p>The question of foresight is perhaps overstated, although a good 

              portion of those I speak with emphasise this. I assume that GBC 

              members see ISKCON's problems as they are, that they are not living 

              in the dark ages of assuming that the solution to all the movement's 

              troubles lie only in book distribution and individual <i>sadhana</i>. 

              Please understand, I am not trying to diminish the importance of 

              either of these. Rather, I believe that many of ISKCON's problems 

              are social and organisational in nature, and that the leadership 

              has been slow to respond to the needs of families, especially women 

              and children. </p>

            <p>Even in recent years (although I think the volume of this <i>mantra 

              </i>must be more muted these days), I have heard <i>sannyasi </i>GBC 

              leaders (of which there are many) stating that they are not responsible 

              for the affairs of householders and family life, that it is inappropriate 

              for <i>sannyasis </i>to be involved in these issues. Perhaps this 

              is true. Yet ISKCON in North America and throughout much of the 

              world is overwhelmingly a householder's movement. Such a principled 

              stance of 'hands off' by <i>sannyasis </i>effectively means they 

              are providing little or no leadership to the rank and file. </p>

            <p>It is time that the GBC engages the needs of its membership; if 

              <i>sannyasis </i>want to hold firm to the idea that this is not 

              their business, they should remove themselves from the GBC or act 

              only in an advisory role. Simply put, ISKCON needs leaders - active 

              leaders who are responsive to the rank and file. Regretting the 

              presence of so many fallen householders is no qualification for 

              leadership.</p>

            <p><i>(b) Resources. </i></p>

            <p>Organisationally, ISKCON is an aberration. Try to think of an organisation 

              where the leadership has little or no control over the resources 

              that allow them to act on policies implemented by the Board of Directors. 

              The GBC can make policy, but it often lacks the resources to bring 

              it into fruition. The result is that rank-and-file members often 

              see policy statements as strategy statements. The GBC votes for 

              good things, but only occasionally puts up the funds to bring them 

              about. This is a formula for cynicism. Again, there are exceptions, 

              such as Child Protection, but even here many devotees believe funds 

              are being provided largely to help fend off lawsuits and related 

              challenges.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, in my role as a member of ISKCON's North American 

              Board of Education, I was involved in discussions about enhancing 

              the movement's system of education. This was just after the departure 

              of Harikesa and the demise of funding for education projects. One 

              person who was party to these conversations and was himself a GBC 

              member suggested that our efforts would be better served if we avoided 

              the GBC altogether. His idea was that we should develop our own 

              plan and our own sources of funding. In his view, engaging the GBC 

              represented a wasted effort. As a whole, the GBC lacked both the 

              interest and the resources to do anything to enhance the education 

              of ISKCON's children. At first I argued that this was a GBC responsibility. 

              We must get them involved - that's their job. In the end I had to 

              admit that he was correct. But admitting this also meant acknowledging 

              that ISKCON's leaders and governance structure remained weak and 

              incapable of providing real leadership.</p>

            <p>Simply put, the GBC must find ways to gain command of resources. 

              Without them, it gives only the appearance of leadership (i.e. policy-making) 

              that in the end accomplishes little. The result is that the GBC 

              is viewed by many as politically self-interested and increasingly 

              irrelevant. </p>

            <p><i>(c) Authority. </i></p>

            <p>As I have said before, ISKCON and its leadership face a crisis 

              of trust. Without trust, why should any devotee offer respect to 

              the 'authority' of the GBC? And without authority, the GBC lacks 

              the very basis for leadership itself. Over and over, I hear devotees 

              saying that the GBC is simply irrelevant. It makes little difference 

              what the GBC has to say. For leaders, the biggest threat is not 

              disagreement and conflict. Rather, it is members coming to feel 

              that the leaders and their policies have lost relevance. </p>

            <p>In my view, it is time for the leadership of this movement to offer 

              not only apologies but also 'good works'. Authority and trust in 

              today's ISKCON must be earned. I urge the GBC to move forward on 

              a limited number of specific projects that will benefit devotees 

              and thereby begin the process of restoring trust in the leadership.</p>

            <p><b>(2)</b> <b>ISKCON's authorities, and thereby ISKCON itself, 

              are, in many respects, frozen in time. </b></p>

            <p>Again, I realise that this may be overstated. Yet in a curious 

              way ISKCON's leaders remain tied to ways of thinking that ultimately 

              limit their ability to deal with present and future issues confronting 

              the organisation. I am likely to get into trouble here. While ISKCON's 

              leaders hold dearly to the theological knowledge and insight found 

              in Prabhupada's books and spoken words, they have overlooked, or 

              been hesitant to act on, what I believe was Prabhupada's greatest 

              insight sociologically: 'time, place and circumstance'. As sociologists 

              Berger and Luckmann might say, 'ISKCON lacks dialectical thinking.' 

              Perhaps because of the weakened authority of the leadership, many 

              of ISKCON's leaders hold tightly to Prabhupada's words but not to 

              his wisdom. Failing to act on the basis of time, place and circumstance 

              has meant that ISKCON has lost its dynamic quality. Leaders must 

              be more than theologians attempting to hold close to the words of 

              the scripture. Prabhupada understood this principle when he came 

              to America. He may have been criticised by his Godbrothers for changing 

              things, but he also built a dynamic movement that influenced the 

              world. Who among you is willing to stand up and apply Prabhupada's 

              wisdom rather than simply recite his words? In the same way that 

              Prabhupada's Godbrothers initially questioned his judgement<b> </b>for 

              'changing things', I suspect Prabhupada would think that the GBC 

              is now acting negligently for <i>not </i>bringing about change.</p>

            <p>Prabhupada did not hold to the letter of the law if he saw that 

              making changes would expand the mission of his guru and Lord Caitanya. 

              Yet you have often become passive, applying Prabhupada's words but 

              missing the wisdom that allowed him to build an organisation that 

              was vital, dynamic and often responsive to the needs of its members. 

              Perhaps ironically, the failures of the gurus, the rise of the <i>rtvik 

              </i>movement and ISKCON's continuing efforts to elevate Prabhupada's 

              status make it more difficult to be innovative, to take the risks 

              often associated with leadership. Yet there is a threat in remaining 

              static and resistant to change. </p>

            <p><b>(3)</b> <b>ISKCON's leaders must be careful about how they interpret 

              organisational problems. This is not the time to blame individuals 

              for what amounts to organisational troubles. </b></p>

            <p>I have recently noticed a tendency for some of those who previously 

              were reformers in ISKCON but are now firmly entrenched in the leadership 

              to focus their attention on the faults of the rank-and-file. Of 

              course, this is nothing new; revolutionaries who succeed often protect 

              their newly gained but fragile positions by deflecting attention 

              from the faults of their own administration and governance. Despite 

              what some might think, I do not believe all of ISKCON's organisational 

              problems would melt away if only the members did a better job in 

              practising their <i>sadhana</i>.</p>

            <p>Leaders must not be blamers. They must not fall prey to individualising 

              what are fundamentally social problems. This may be good political 

              strategy but it does little to further the well-being of the organisation 

              they seek to oversee and advance. Leaders must be hard on themselves 

              but compassionate towards those they are supposed to serve. In my 

              estimation, reversing this is politics, and destructive politics 

              at that.</p>

            <p><b>(4) It is time for leaders and other devotees to stop acting 

              on the basis of pretence, position or, more accurately, hiding behind 

              these things. It is time to set the dandas aside - one's real and 

              imagined authority - and talk straight. </b></p>

            <p>This is a time for honesty and openness about ISKCON and its needs. 

              Bluffing will not do. To do otherwise, I believe, leaves ISKCON 

              at risk. While Prabhupada's teachings and Krsna consciousness itself 

              promise to go forward in time, there is no guarantee ISKCON will. 

              Despite what some might think, ISKCON does not exist by divine right. 

              It was born of hard work and commitment, commonsense, organisational 

              strategy and resources, as well as having a powerful theological 

              message and a charismatic leader. To avoid becoming just another 

              weak or failed organisation, ISKCON must earn its survival, its 

              prosperity. This requires that 'position' not get in the way of 

              good sense. Leaders and members alike must pull up their collective 

              sleeves and work together. To do this requires mutual respect, trust, 

              co-operation and setting aside elitist ways of thinking. </p>

            <p>Look around this room. Note the age of the people here. Who will 

              replace each of you? Even more importantly, who will replace ISKCON's 

              first generation as its dies off over the next twenty-five years 

              or so? ISKCON in North America has done poorly at holding onto its 

              second generation. Over the past twenty years it has not had great 

              success in recruiting new members to its communities, either. Given 

              this, it seems reasonable to ask: Who will be worshipping in ISKCON's 

              temples twenty, thirty, forty years from now? Will ISKCON become 

              largely an ethnic church catering to the spiritual needs of ethnic 

              Indians? Will it lose its ability to mobilise people from all backgrounds 

              seeking religious life and salvation? I don't know what the outcome 

              will be, but I do know the decisions made (or not made) today by 

              ISKCON's leaders will certainly influence the fate of Prabhupada's 

              movement. I pray that wisdom, a collective spirit of revival and 

              an openness to reform and change will keep ISKCON a dynamic and 

              relevant vehicle for promoting Krsna consciousness in North America 

              and worldwide. </p>
