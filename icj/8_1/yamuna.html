            and Beauty<br>
            </b><b><span class="maintextsubhead">Presentation by</span> <a href="biodata.html#yd" class="maintext">Yamuna 
            Devi Dasi</a></b> 
            <p>What a week of Vaisnava <i>sadhu-satsanga </i>this has been! I 

              leave the richer, having exchanged with my family members, old and 

              new, Godbrothers, Godsisters, nephews and nieces. While I feel most 

              unqualified to speak to you today, I am honoured and privileged 

              to join my Godsisters in voicing my concerns as a woman in ISKCON.</p>

            <p>As the GBC body, all of you are responsible for establishing Srila 

              Prabhupada's legacy, which, in these difficult and turbulent times, 

              is at stake. One realm of that legacy - the rapport Srila Prabhupada 

              established with his Vaisnavi disciples - is the topic of our discussion 

              today, because over the years since his disappearance it has been 

              largely forgotten. Perhaps my personal service and association with 

              him, along with his later guidance and instructions, offer some 

              insights in this area.</p>

            <p>As a strong and independent young woman I met Srila Prabhupada 

              in 1966 and took initiation in 1967. Had Srila Prabhupada demanded 

              conformity to orthodox roles for women as a condition of surrender, 

              I, along with many of my Godsisters, would probably not have joined 

              ISKCON. That he did not is testament to his spiritual vision. He 

              lovingly encouraged and engaged us in the service of the <i>sankirtana</i> 

              movement, and he consistently revealed himself to be <i>panditah 

              sama-darsinah </i>- equal to all.</p>

            <p>In both men and women, Srila Prabhupada observed our propensities 

              and expertly dovetailed them in his preaching mission. For many 

              years, in different countries and circumstances, I had the good 

              fortune to render personal service to him. He trained me, urged 

              me to accept more and more responsibility, and regularly asked me 

              to lead <i>kirtanas</i>, give classes, arrange programmes, manage 

              departments, provide comforts for visiting devotees, meet with leaders, 

              and actively promulgate Krsna consciousness. In ISKCON India, where 

              previously no women were allowed, he sent me to various temples 

              to learn cooking and Deity worship, and he repeatedly asked me to 

              train others in the same.</p>

            <p>It would take much longer than the limited time I have here to 

              give you a glimpse into the numerous exchanges that illustrate Srila 

              Prabhupada's demeanour and mood. However, one such exchange is what 

              I call the Canakya Pandita episodes. I was present on four occasions 

              when Srila Prabhupada repeated the Canakya adage: 'Never trust a 

              woman or a politician.' On each occasion Srila Prabhupada looked 

              me in the eye to see my response. On the last occasion, in Bombay 

              in 1973, he quoted the saying, heartily laughing in front of a small 

              group of men. Then he said: 'What do you think, Yamuna?' Immediately 

              I retorted: 'Of course it is true, Srila Prabhupada,' whereupon 

              he became grave, looked at me with great feeling, and said, 'But 

              you are not a woman, you are a Vaisnava.'</p>

            <p>Another series of exchanges centred on leading <i>kirtana</i>. 

              Srila Prabhupada often had me lead the first <i>kirtana </i>before 

              he spoke at a programme, whether in front of twenty people or ten 

              thousand people. There were occasions when I felt uncomfortable 

              with this. At the Jaipur <i>pandal </i>at Radha Govinda temple, 

              I refused to lead <i>kirtana</i>. Srila Prabhupada called me over 

              and said, 'Lead <i>kirtana</i>.' I said, 'I can't. My throat hurts.' 

              He said, 'No. Lead <i>kirtana</i>.' So, croaking like a frog, I 

              led <i>kirtana</i>.</p>

            <p>In late 1974, not long after I had left my householder <i>asrama</i>, 

              Srila Prabhupada pronounced it 'good that you have left your husband', 

              and encouraged me to become a <i>'sannyasini'.</i> Although I was 

              not in the traditional role of being protected by my father, husband 

              or son, in both his personal <i>darsanas</i> and written instructions, 

              Srila Prabhupada offered me unfettered encouragement and astonished 

              me with unexpected answers to my questions.</p>

            <p>After settling in Oregon with my Godsister Dinatarine, Srila Prabhupada, 

              while pronouncing us 'independent' to a concerned Godbrother, at 

              the same time twice rebuked us when we approached him to leave. 

              'You westerners are so restless,' he admonished. 'Why can't you 

              remain in the same place? Stay where you are.' We questioned, 'But 

              Srila Prabhupada, they are saying that if we aren't in ISKCON, we 

              lose your blessings and cannot make advancement.' Prabhupada replied, 

              'ISKCON is where you are chanting the holy name - that is ISKCON.' 

              We rejoined: 'They are saying we don't have any association here 

              and are therefore in <i>maya.</i>' He replied: 'Association can 

              be two or two hundred. If you are two and compatible, you can become 

              perfect in Krsna consciousness. If you are 200 and are not, then 

              no one will make advancement.'</p>

            <p>To conclude, Srila Prabhupada trained me to be concerned about 

              his movement, and at this time I am deeply concerned. Now more than 

              ever, it is time to revive and imbibe Srila Prabhupada's mood with 

              his disciples. If we neglect this, an aspect of his greatness will 

              remain unknown to future generations.</p>

            <p>I appeal to the GBC that along with the laudable projects you are 

              managing and those you are contemplating - especially the magnificent 

              temple that will arise here in Sridhama Mayapura - consider that 

              the behaviour of the ISKCON devotees who participate in these projects 

              must also be magnificent. Any other behaviour will make the projects 

              less than worthy of Srila Prabhupada's name. This grave responsibility 

              falls on you. In other words, let us instil in every person who 

              comes into contact with Srila Prabhupada's movement the healthy 

              spiritual relationships that he had with his followers - his mood 

              of encouragement, protection and kindness.</p>

            <p>The closer we come to individually appreciating and honouring Srila 

              Prabhupada's personal dealings with his disciples, the closer we 

              will come to his sense of completeness in Krsna consciousness, to 

              his joyfulness, to his transcendentally attractive nature.</p>

            <p>With great care, our service is to create a devotional environment 

              where men, women and children can thrive in Krsna consciousness, 

              rendering service according to their desire and inclination. Our 

              service is to empower rather than inhibit the service propensity 

              in others.</p>

            <p>Finally, let us search our intelligence and hearts for ways to 

              help the women who are sincerely looking for spiritual life. Without 

              properly nurturing them, we as a society have no future. Women in 

              Krsna consciousness are an intricate, essential part of Srila Prabhupada's 

              legacy. In our effort to move forward, let us not put Srila Prabhupada's 

              example behind us, but in front of us - our divine beacon - to guide 

              us together towards the lotus feet of Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai and Sri 

              Sri Radha-Krsna.</p>
