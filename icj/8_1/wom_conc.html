            <p>The presentations published here led to the GBC adopting a series 

              of resolutions (see end) aimed at recognising the value of women 

              in ISKCON and ensuring their right to fully participate in the Society 

              according to their abilities and wishes. </p>

            <p>It is a significant point in ISKCON history as it is the first 

              time these rights have been so clearly stated by ISKCON's governing 

              body. The real test of ISKCON's will to rectify prejudicial behaviour 

              lies ahead. The GBC has apologised for its behaviour and the behaviour 

              of the Society at large, but how will the Society at large respond 

              to the call to provide '... equal facilities, full encouragement, 

              and genuine care and protection for the women members of ISKCON'? 

              Will, as the GBC requests, senior women be invited to temples to 

              preach? Will women really no longer be expected to stand at the 

              back of the temple room during worship? Will 'equal facility' be 

              taken to mean that women can have their turn at chanting in the 

              temple room during <i>japa </i>period? Does 'full encouragement' 

              mean that women have a right to participate in managerial decision-making 

              or to preach according to their ability rather than their gender 

              role? </p>

            <p>The resolutions have been passed, now it is time to see if they 

              are taken to heart. The first signs were not too hopeful. Immediately 

              after the GBC meetings it was felt by many that as a sign of goodwill 

              a woman should be allowed, for the first time, to give <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 

              </i>class in ISKCON's Mayapura temple. The temple management was 

              strongly opposed arguing that it was against local custom and would 

              undermine ISKCON's status in its own spiritual heartland. The debate 

              was long and, at times, heated. However, the temple management relented 

              and Visakha Devi Dasi gave class. Alternative arrangements were 

              made for those who preferred not to attend. Reports indicate that 

              some temples may be prepared to ignore the resolutions. Will these 

              temples be held to account or will they be left to go their own 

              way?</p>

            <p>There will be dilemmas to confront in this process. Many, inside 

              and outside of ISKCON, will be watching to see if these dilemmas 

              are dealt with fairly and honestly. This will be the real test of 

              ISKCON's commitment to its women.</p>

            <p><b>GBC Resolutions 2000</b></p>

            <p><i>Section 501.</i></p>

            <p>WHEREAS, the Women's Ministry presentation on 1 March 2000, to 

              the international GBC brought a clearer understanding of the mistakes 

              of the past and the need to provide equal and full opportunity for 

              devotional service for all devotees in ISKCON, regardless of gender, 

              and</p>

            <p>WHEREAS, it is clearly following in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu 

              and His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada that all 

              people are welcome to join Lord Caitanya's <i>sankirtana </i>movement 

              and are capable of developing love of God, and</p>

            <p>WHEREAS, it is our belief that many of the social issues that confront 

              us are exacerbated because the voices of our women, who are the 

              mothers and daughters of our Krsna conscious family, have been hushed 

              and stifled owing to misinterpretation of our Vaisnava philosophy, 

              and the resultant minimisation of the human needs of our devotees.</p>

            <p><i>THEREFORE IT IS RESOLVED THAT:</i></p>

            <p>The members of the Governing Body Commission of the International 

              Society for Krishna Consciousness, offer their humble apologies 

              to the women of Srila Prabhupada's society, who, because of our 

              own shortcomings and those of the Society, have suffered due to 

              a lack of protection, support, facility, and appreciation for their 

              service, devotion, and vast contributions to the society,</p>

            <p>All GBC members and other leaders shall hold <i>ista-gosthis</i> 

              in each of their respective temples to establish the priority of 

              providing equal facilities, full encouragement, and genuine care 

              and protection for the women members of ISKCON. Also, separate meetings 

              shall be held with the leaders and women of each temple to address 

              the women's needs and concerns, and</p>

            <p>All GBC Zonal secretaries, Temple Presidents and other leaders 

              are requested, in coordination with the Women's Ministry, to invite 

              senior devotee women, especially Srila Prabhup?da's direct disciples, 

              to visit their temples to provide their association and thus help 

              in training younger devotees.</p>

            <p><i>Section 618. Women's Participation.</i></p>

            <p>A. All ISKCON temples are to allow all qualified devotees, regardless 

              of gender, to speak on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 

              etc. during the regular temple class.</p>

            <p>B. All ISKCON temples designate half of the temple room area, divided 

              in the centre from the altar, for the ladies.</p>

            <p>C. If the management in a particular temple feels it is unable 

              to implement these proposals, the Executive Committee will appoint 

              a small team of senior devotees, including women, to sensitively 

              review the particular local situation.</p>
