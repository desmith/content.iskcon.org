            <p><i>Our last issue featured a panel discussion hosted by the American 

              Family Foundation, one of the major anti-cult groups in the US, 

              entitled 'Can Cultic Groups Change? The Case of ISKCON'. Dr Rahul 

              Peter Das questioned Anuttama Dasa's statements about authority 

              and leadership in ISKCON. Dr Das particularly refers to possible 

              contradictions with concepts of the divine guru that underly much 

              of Indian philosophical systems. Here Hrdayananda Dasa Goswami, 

              himself a guru in the Vaisnava line, attempts to resolve the apparent 

              contradiction between tradition and democracy, explaining the role 

              of the guru in a society with a collegial governing body.</i></p>

            <p>On 15 May 1999, the American Family Foundation, which monitors 

              and informs the public about 'cults', held its annual conference 

              in St Paul, Minnesota, USA. Interestingly, ISKCON's North American 

              Minister of Communications, Anuttama Dasa, along with Radha Dasi, 

              a legal consultant to ISKCON in North America, appeared on a conference 

              panel entitled 'Can Cultic Groups Change: The Case of ISKCON'.</p>

            <p><i>The ISKCON Communications Journal</i> (ICJ) then published the 

              proceedings of the panel, and one of its academic readers, the distinguished 

              Indologist Dr Rahul Peter Das, wrote to the editors, expressing 

              his concern about some of Anuttama's statements. The editors subsequently 

              asked me to respond to this issue. I will thus present here Anuttama's 

              original statement, the response by Dr Das and my own observations. 

            </p>

            <p> 

            <p><b>Anuttama'</b><b>s statement:</b></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>ISKCON is new. Many of our organisational problems came from 

                the fact that in the early years especially, most ISKCON members 

                were young Western converts. Due to a lack of maturity and organisational 

                structure there was a vulnerability to excess and abuse of power.</p>

              <p>Another issue, or tension, for us is the question of authority 

                and leadership. The traditional model in most Indian religious 

                traditions is a hierarchical organisation, with the concentration 

                of power in the hands of one individual, the guru, or <i>acarya</i>. 

                Shortly before passing away, my teacher, Prabhupada, established 

                a Governing Body Commission, a group of people to oversee the 

                ISKCON organisation. After his de&nbsp;ath in 1977, there was 

                a series of crises with some of the topmost, hand-selected leaders 

                who had been appointed as gurus. There was quite a struggle between 

                the organisation and some of those individuals who argued that 

                as gurus their position was above the authority of the GBC.</p>

              <p>This struggle lasted for years. Many people argued that the tradition 

                supports the guru as the absolute principal of authority, divine 

                authority. This can be strongly documented in much of Hindu religious 

                thought. Our organisation has struggled to solidly establish that, 

                in our movement, no one is above our managing body and that there 

                must be checks and balances for all. In 1986, there was a series 

                of reforms limiting what is known in ISKCON jargon as the 'zonal-<i>acarya</i> 

                system.' This year, 1999, there was another series of resolutions 

                passed at the international meetings giving more specific interpretation 

                of appropriate powers and privileges for those in leadership positions.<sup><a href="#1d">1</a><a name="1"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p><b>Dr Rahul Peter Das's response:</b></p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote> 

              <p>As an outsider to any religion, but one interested in ISKCON 

                as a manifestation of a stream of Indian religious thought (which 

                is a major part of what I study), I see a theological problem 

                in a statement by Anuttama Dasa on the question of authority and 

                leadership.</p>

              <p>It is, of course, commonplace that in many Indian religious traditions, 

                including modern ones like the Ananda Marga, there is no difference 

                between the supreme/divine principle and the <i>sad-guru</i>, 

                the latter being but a corporeal manifestation of the former. 

                This is obvious in your own tradition, too (Caitanya).</p>

              <p>To the outsider, it seems that the attraction of ISKCON to many 

                followers is the application of this principle to Prabhupada and 

                that one could justly speak of him being, within ISKCON, a manifestation 

                similar to Caitanya (this is, I emphasise once again, the outsider's 

                view, but one confirmed by much of what is said and published 

                within ISKCON itself and in its iconography).</p>

              <p>Now, it is known that in religious movements with such a background 

                (Indian Sufism is a good example of this), authority often takes 

                the form of transference of this divine aspect to another corporeal 

                being, very often an offspring of the original guru (material 

                transference is clearly important here). This is a form of leadership 

                that has nothing to do with the secular Western democratic principles 

                mentioned in the pages quoted. I therefore see here not a question 

                of democracy or the like, but of fundamental theological doctrine, 

                and I would be very interested in finding out how the 'reformers' 

                within ISKCON have actually come to terms with this problem.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>My response:</b></p>

            <p>Let us keep in mind that Anuttama Dasa was speaking at an 'anti-cult' 

              convention. Historically, one of the main concerns of such groups 

              has been what they perceive to be the tendency of 'cults' to invest 

              absolute authority in a human leader, who may then abuse and exploit 

              such power. Thus Anuttama attempts to assure the audience that ISKCON 

              has taken positive steps to subordinate the power of the guru to 

              a collegial, administrative board, the GBC. Anuttama does point 

              out, however, that 'many people argued that the tradition supports 

              the guru as the absolute principal of divine authority'. He even 

              admits that the absolute position of the guru 'can be strongly documented 

              in much of Hindu religious thought'. But despite that fact, 'our 

              organisation has struggled to solidly establish that in our movement 

              no one is above our managing body and that there must be checks 

              and balances for all.'</p>

            <p>The obvious problem here can be outlined as follows:</p>

            <p> 

            <ol>

              <li> Hindu tradition seems to give absolute authority to the guru.</li>

              <li>ISKCON denies such authority to its own gurus. Y</li>

              <li>et ISKCON claims to be an authentic part of Hinduism.</li>

            </ol>

            <p></p>

            <p>Das immediately perceived this problem, and I shall now list and 

              reply to the three basic arguments of his letter. </p>

            <p><b>Rahul Peter Das: </b></p>

            <p><i>It is, of course, commonplace that in many Indian religious 

              traditions, including modern ones like the Ananda Marga, there is 

              no difference between the supreme/divine principle and the </i>sad-guru,<i> 

              the latter being but a corporeal manifestation of the former. This 

              is obvious in your own tradition, too (Caitanya).</i></p>

            <p><b>Hrdayananda Dasa Goswami: </b></p>

            <p>To claim that one's <i>sad-guru</i> (spiritual master) is identical 

              with 'the supreme/divine principle' is to make an ontological claim, 

              a claim involving the nature of being. Indeed, the great theological 

              debates in India among such leading Vedantists as Sankara, Ramanuja 

              and Madhva centred precisely on rival ontological claims about the 

              nature of being. Specifically, the great Vedantists disputed the 

              nature of the relationship between the Upanisadic absolute, <i>brahman</i>, 

              'the supreme/divine principle', and the material world with its 

              individual souls housed in physical and psychic bodies. </p>

            <p>The claim that in the Caitanya tradition, 'there is no difference 

              between the supreme/divine principle and the <i>sad-guru</i>, or 

              authentic spiritual master', is only partially true. Sri Caitanya 

              taught the ontological doctrine of <i>bhedabheda-tattva</i>, the 

              simultaneous 'difference and nondifference' between God and the 

              innumerable individual souls who rest upon Him. Srila Prabhupada 

              explained that individual souls are qualitatively one with Krsna, 

              or God, but quantitatively different. In other words, our consciousness, 

              in its original, pure state, is equal in quality to that of the 

              consciousness of God, but God's consciousness is infinite, whereas 

              ours, in comparison, is infinitesimal. </p>

            <p>At present, we who are 'conditioned souls', trapped within the 

              material nature, experience a covered, impure consciousness, but 

              in Krsna consciousness, pure love of God, we experience our original 

              divine awareness. To the members of ISKCON, Srila Prabhupada is 

              a liberated soul, fixed in his original, pure consciousness, and 

              thus able, in pure devotion, to transparently represent Lord Krsna. 

              Thus a pure soul like Srila Prabhupada is 'one' with the Lord in 

              two senses:</p>

            <p> 

            <ol>

              <li> Just as any authentic representative stands for, and is, in 

                that sense, identical with that which he or she represents, so 

                the genuine representative of God is identical with God. For example, 

                if I purchase an airline ticket from an authorised agent of the 

                airline, the airline must honour that ticket, even if the agent 

                has made a mistake in my favour. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada's 

                assurance of spiritual liberation for his serious followers will 

                be honoured by Lord Krsna.</li>

              <li>As mentioned above, all living beings, pure or impure, are held 

                to be, in an ontological sense, qualitatively one with God. However, 

                a pure soul like Srila Prabhupada has realised his divine nature 

                and acts accordingly.</li>

            </ol>

            <p></p>

            <p>We note here that certain monistic doctrines do, in fact, claim 

              that the guru, and ultimately all souls, are one in all respects 

              with the 'supreme/divine principle'. But Vaisnava communities, such 

              as the Gaudiya Vaisnavas,<sup><a href="#2d">2</a><a name="2"></a> 

              </sup>although acknowledging that God sometimes incarnates in this 

              world, in general fervently oppose such monistic ideas. </p>

            <p>There are, of course, other groups that admit to a type of monotheism, 

              but then claim that their guru is an incarnation of the one God. 

              ISKCON makes no such claim for Srila Prabhupada. Indeed, in 1970, 

              Srila Prabhupada expelled four of his senior disciples who dared 

              to claim that he was God. One may read of this in the standard biography 

              <i>Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta</i> by Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami.</p>

            <p>In general, the members of ISKCON faithfully follow Srila Prabhupada 

              because they recognise him to be a pure representative of God, and 

              thus they are confident that by pleasing him, they are pleasing 

              the Supreme Lord. For those diligently engaged in the spiritual 

              practice of Krsna consciousness, this is not merely a theory or 

              belief, but a practical, daily experience.</p>

            <p><b>Rahul Peter Das:</b><i> </i></p>

              in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (7.16),<sup><a href="#3d">3</a><a name="3"></a> 

              </sup>Lord Krsna states that people approach Him with four types 

              of motives: to alleviate suffering, to achieve prosperity, to satisfy 

              curiosity and to attain final wisdom. </p>

            <p>But one would expect all those who seek God, regardless of their 

              motive, to be concerned with the quality of their contact or link 

              with God. In that sense, the conviction of ISKCON devotees of Srila 

              Prabhupada's unique ability to purely represent God is indeed a 

              compelling one. Again, however, this in no way implies a monistic 

              perception of Srila Prabhupada as God Himself. In fact, the Vaisnavas 

              claim just the opposite: that the more one humbly surrenders to 

              the Supreme Lord, the more one can serve and represent Him purely. 

              Thus ISKCON devotees glorify Srila Prabhupada as divine precisely 

              because of his full submission to God, a qualification which Srila 

              Prabhupada painstakingly taught them to insist upon in a guru.</p>

            <p>'I emphasise', says Professor Das, 'this is the outsider's view.' 

              Thus we may say that from the 'insider's view', it is not merely 

              the 'application' of a theological principle to Srila Prabhupada 

              that attracts many to him but rather the direct experience of ISKCON 

              devotees of Srila Prabhupada's dramatic ability to bring his followers 

              into close proximity of Lord Krsna.</p>

            <p><b>Rahul Peter Das: </b></p>

            <p><i>Now, it is known that in religious movements with such a background 

              (Indian Sufism is a good example of this), authority often takes 

              the form of transference of this divine aspect to another corporeal 

              being, very often an offspring of the original guru (material transference 

              is clearly important here). This is a form of leadership that has 

              nothing to do with the secular Western democratic principles mentioned 

              in the pages quoted. I therefore see here not a question of democracy 

              or the like, but of fundamental theological doctrine, and I would 

              be very interested in finding out how the </i>'<i>reformers</i>'<i> 

              within ISKCON have actually come to terms with this problem.</i></p>

            <p><b>Hrdayananda Dasa Goswami: </b></p>

            <p>Professor Das raises several points here, which I will address 

              in order.</p>

            <p>He refers to the general issue of the transference of authority 

              from the guru to his or her successors.</p>

            <p>Whenever the issue of the transmission of divine authority arises, 

              Vaisnavas generally quote Lord Krsna's description in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              (4.1-3) of the <i>parampara</i>, the chain of disciplic succession 

              that begins with the Lord Himself. Lord Krsna states here that He 

              has chosen to speak this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna, since this 

              middle son of Pandu is the Lord's devotee (<i>bhakta</i>) and friend 

              (<i>sakha</i>). Similarly, Lord Krsna states elsewhere in the <i>Gita</i> 

              (13.19), 'My devotee [<i>mad-bhakta</i>] realises this [divine knowledge] 

              and thus attains to My nature.'<sup><a href="#4d">4</a><a name="4"></a> 

              </sup>It would not be difficult to argue from the vast array of 

              Vaisnava literature that possessing spiritual, and specifically 

              devotional, qualities, rather than a mystic family connection, qualifies 

              the disciple to become a guru. Indeed, in normal education, a good 

              student gets the chance to become a teacher, not merely a child 

              of the former teacher.</p>

            <p>He also mentions that 'very often' the guru's authority is transferred 

              to the guru's child (or, presumably, another relative).</p>

            <p>In writing my commentary on the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i> verses 

              11.1.5, I quoted Srila Prabhupada's spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 

              Sarasvati Thakura, who in his own commentary on these verses spoke 

              directly and thoroughly on the issue of awarding spiritual authority 

              to one's material offspring. The context is a discussion of the 

              famous incident towards the end of Lord Krsna's life on earth, in 

              which almost all of the members of the Lord's own Yadu dynasty killed 

              each other in a fratricidal battle. I give below my commentary on 

              those verses, which is based on that of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 

              Thakura:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has made a very important 

                comment on this verse. He states that since the intentions of 

                the Supreme Lord, Krsnacandra, are always perfect, it was certainly 

                in consideration of the greatest benefit for the entire world 

                that He destroyed His own family on the pretext of a curse by 

                <i>brahmanas</i>. In this connection, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 

                Thakura has shown a parallel in the pastimes of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, 

                who is Krsna Himself appearing as His own devotee.</p>

              <p>Lord Caitanya appeared along with His first plenary expansion, 

                known as Lord Nityananda Prabhu, and with Lord Advaita Prabhu. 

                All three personalities - Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu 

                and Advaita Prabhu - are accepted by Vaisnava <i>acaryas </i>to 

                be in the category of <i>visnu-tattva</i>, the full status of 

                the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These three Personalities 

                of Godhead perceived that in the future Their so-called seminal 

                descendants would get undue recognition and thus, being puffed 

                up, would commit grave offences against those who were actually 

                Vaisnava gurus or representatives of the Lord.</p>

              <p>Every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, as 

                stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (<i>mamaivamsah</i>). Every 

                living entity is originally a son of God, yet to execute His pastimes 

                the Lord selects certain highly qualified living entities whom 

                He allows to take birth as His personal relatives. But those living 

                entities who appear as descendants of the Lord's personal family 

                may undoubtedly become proud of such a position and thus abuse 

                the great adulation they receive from ordinary people. In this 

                way such persons may artificially get undue attention and divert 

                people from the actual principle of spiritual advancement, which 

                is to surrender to the pure devotee who represents the Lord. The 

                last eight verses of the Twelfth Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>give 

                a description of the pure devotees the Lord permits to act as 

                <i>acaryas</i>, or spiritual leaders of mankind. In other words, 

                simply to take birth in the personal family of Krsna is not the 

                qualification for being a spiritual master, since according to 

                <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, <i>pitaham asya</i> <i>jagatah:</i> every 

                living entity is eternally a member of the Lord's family. Krsna 

                says in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, <i>samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu na me 

                dvesyo 'sti na priyah:</i> 'I am equal to everyone. No one is 

                My enemy, and no one is My special friend.' If the Supreme Personality 

                of Godhead appears to have a special family, such as the Yadu 

                dynasty, such a so-called family is a special arrangement of the 

                Lord's pastimes in order to attract the conditioned souls. When 

                Krsna descends, He acts as if He were an ordinary person in order 

                to attract the living entities to His pastimes. Therefore Krsna 

                acted as though the Yadu dynasty was His personal family, although 

                in fact every living entity is a member of His family.</p>

              <p>Ordinary people, however, not understanding the higher principles 

                of spiritual knowledge, easily forget the actual qualifications 

                of a bona fide spiritual master and instead give undue importance 

                to people born in the Lord's so-called family. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, 

                therefore, avoided this impediment on the path of spiritual enlightenment 

                by leaving behind no children. Although Caitanya Mahaprabhu married 

                twice, He was childless. Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the Supreme 

                Personality of Godhead, did not accept any of the natural sons 

                born of His own son, Sri Virabhadra. Similarly, Lord Advaita Acarya 

                divested of His association all of His sons except Acyutananda 

                and two others. Acyutananda, the chief faithful son of Advaita 

                Acarya, had no seminal progeny, and the remaining three of the 

                six sons of Lord Advaita fell from the path of devotion to the 

                Lord and are known as rejected sons. In other words, the appearance 

                of Caitanya Mahaprabhu allowed little facility for continuing 

                a so-called seminal family to create confusion. The respect shown 

                to the conception of seminal lineage in deference to the ideas 

                of the <i>smartas </i>is unfit to be accepted by one who actually 

                understands the supreme truth from Vedic authority.</p>

              <p>Other <i>acaryas</i>, or spiritual masters, have also demonstrated 

                this point in their own families. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta 

                Svami Prabhupada, our own beloved spiritual master, who is the 

                mighty author of this <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> series, was born 

                into a family of pure devotees, and he himself exhibited all the 

                symptoms of pure devotional service from childhood. Srila Prabhupada 

                eventually came to the Western countries and exhibited unprecedented 

                spiritual potency in establishing the Krsna consciousness movement 

                all over the world. In a few short years, he translated more than 

                fifty large volumes of Vedic philosophy. By his practical activities 

                he is certainly understood to be a most empowered representative 

                of the Lord. Nonetheless, his own family members, although devotees 

                of Krsna, did not come up to the proper standard of devotional 

                service and are therefore not given attention by the members of 

                ISKCON. The natural tendency for the members of the International 

                Society for Krsna Consciousness would be to offer all reverence 

                and worship to the members of Srila Prabhupada's immediate family. 

                But since by Krsna's arrangement these family members are not 

                on the platform of pure devotional service, the members of ISKCON 

                give them scant attention, and worship instead those who actually 

                exhibit the qualities of highly advanced Vaisnavas, regardless 

                of their birth. In other words, birth cannot constitute the qualification 

                for a respectable person, even when one is born into the Lord's 

                own family or into the <i>acarya's</i> family, what to speak of 

                an ordinary wealthy or learned family.</p>

              <p>In India there is a class of men known as <i>nityananda-vamsa</i>, 

                who claim to be direct descendants of Lord Nityananda and therefore 

                worthy of the highest respect for their position in devotional 

                service. In this regard, Srila Prabhupada has written in <i>The</i> 

                <i>Nectar of Devotion</i>, 'In the Middle Ages, after the disappearance 

                of Lord Caitanya's great associate Lord Nityananda, a class of 

                priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nityananda, 

                calling themselves the <i>gosvami</i> caste. They further claimed 

                that the practice and spreading of devotional service belonged 

                only to their particular class, which was known as <i>nityananda-vamsa</i>. 

                In this way they exercised their artificial power for some time, 

                until Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, the powerful <i>acarya</i> 

                of the Gaudiya Vaisnava <i>sampradaya</i>, completely smashed 

                their idea. There was a great struggle for some time, but it was 

                successful, and it is now correctly and practically established 

                that devotional service is not restricted to a particular class 

                of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in devotional service 

                is already a high-class <i>brahmana</i>. So Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 

                Sarasvati Thakura's struggle for this movement has been successful. 

                It is on the basis of his position that anyone, from any part 

                of the universe, can become a Gaudiya Vaisnava.</p>

              <p>In other words, the essence of spiritual knowledge is that every 

                living being, regardless of his present status in life, is originally 

                a servant of the Supreme Lord, and it is the mission of the Lord 

                to reclaim all of these fallen living entities. Despite his past 

                situation, any living being who is willing to surrender again 

                at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative 

                can purify himself by strictly adhering to the rules and regulations 

                of <i>bhakti</i>-<i>yoga </i>and thus act as a high-class <i>brahmana</i>. 

                Nonetheless, the seminal descendants of the Lord think themselves 

                to have acquired their ancestor's character and position. Thus 

                the Supreme Lord, who is the well-wisher of the entire universe 

                and especially of His devotees, bewilders the discriminatory power 

                of His own descendants in such a contradictory way that these 

                seminal descendants become recognised as deviant and the actual 

                qualification to be a representative of the Lord, namely unalloyed 

                surrender to the will of Krsna, remains prominent.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Finally, I will address Das's claim that in normal Hindu tradition, 

              the transmission of divine authority 'has nothing to do with the 

              secular Western democratic principles mentioned in the pages quoted'. 

            </p>

            <p>We may first note that ISKCON does not follow the principles of 

              a popular 'Jacksonian' democracy, but rather invests ultimate managing 

              authority in a body of senior leaders. Traditionally, the members 

              of the governing board appoint new members, and thus one might more 

              reasonably accuse this system of being an 'oligarchy', a term that 

              seems to be somewhat infected with negative connotations in contemporary 

              culture. To be fair, there is a growing trend in ISKCON to insist 

              that even GBC members be elected by senior members of the spiritual 

              communities they are to govern. Indeed, the largest ISKCON community 

              in North America, in Alachua, Florida, has recently declared its 

              intention of electing its own GBC representative to whom the international 

              GBC may or may not award voting rights.</p>

            <p>Yet the basic issue remains: can the 'Hindu' or 'Vedic' guru authentically 

              function under the authority of a governing body, however constituted? 

              I will argue that he or she can, to some extent. I base my argument 

              on a rather broad overview of Vedic civilisation, in the traditional, 

              not the academic, sense of the term 'Vedic'.</p>

            <p>The most influential Vaisnava scriptures, such as the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 

              and the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, and foundational texts, such as the 

              <i>Mahabharata</i>, state that the universe is what I call a 'cosmic 

              village'. Important people throughout the cosmos know, and know 

              about, each other, and have regular mutual dealings. Thus, the celestial 

              gods, the semi-divine Gandharvas and Apsaras, the celestial 'bad 

              guys' known as Asuras, Daityas or Danavas, the human beings on earth, 

              the great Naga serpents, etc., are all intimately acquainted with 

              one another and regularly interact. Within this 'cosmic village', 

              there is a universally recognised code of behaviour known as <i>dharma</i>. 

              Of course, the theistic Vaisnavas claim that <i>dharma</i> is the 

              'law of God', but even the decent nontheists, and at times even 

              the demonic, recognise the power of <i>dharma</i> and the dangers 

              of <i>adharma</i>. My point is that the guru, as he appears in ancient 

              scriptures, functions within and for this cosmic village ruled by 

              <i>dharma</i>. </p>

            <p>It is necessary here to make a distinction between a 'mere' guru 

              and the <i>acarya</i>. The Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines 

              <i>acarya </i>as 'knowing or teaching the <i>acara</i> or rules; 

              a spiritual guide or teacher'. In Hindu tradition, one may call 

              one's spiritual preceptor '<i>acarya</i>', but the term has another, 

              larger sense in which it denotes the great teachers who have guided 

              the destiny of Indian religious civilisation. It is in this sense 

              that the mighty Sankara is Sankaracarya; that the great Ramanuja 

              is Ramanujacarya; that Madhva is Madhvacarya; that Vallabha is Vallabhacarya, 

              etc.</p>

            <p>We find a distinction between <i>acarya </i>and guru in Rupa Goswami's 

              <i>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu</i>, as rendered by Srila Prabhupada. 

              There, in the sixth chapter, Rupa Goswami lists as one of the 'basic 

              principles' of <i>bhakti-yoga</i>, 'following in the footsteps of 

              great <i>acaryas</i> (teachers) under the direction of the spiritual 

              master'. Thus the 'great <i>acarya</i>' is distinguished from the 

              'spiritual master' (guru) in the sense that the guru guides the 

              disciple in the programme or discipline of teaching established 

              by the great <i>acarya</i>. Hinduism has actually functioned this 

              way for many centuries.</p>

            <p>Indeed, in the <i>Mahabharata</i>, great <i>acaryas</i> occasionally 

              declare a new <i>dharma</i>, an example being the injunction of 

              Sukracarya that <i>brahmanas </i>were no longer allowed to drink 

              liquor (<i>Mahabharata</i>, 1.71.52-5), or that of Svetaketu that 

              women must be monogamous (<i>Mahabharata</i>, 1.113.15-20). </p>

            <p>Even in these two examples, however, adjustments are made to ethical 

              codes, for even the <i>acarya </i>cannot change the <i>sanatana-dharma 

              </i>(eternal<i> dharma</i>). Thus the same Sukracarya who declared 

              the new drinking law lost his status as <i>acarya</i> when, as described 

              in the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, Canto 8, Chapter 19, he instructed 

              his disciple Bali Maharaja not to obey the Supreme Lord, who had 

              appeared before them as Vamana.</p>

            <p>Returning to our cosmic village, we find that even the great <i>acaryas</i>, 

              what to speak of the 'ordinary' gurus, must obey the law of God. 

              Even a disciple, as in the case of Bali, may detect a discrepancy 

              in the guru. A striking confirmation of this principle is found 

              in a statement by Bhisma to Yudhisthira in the <i>Mahabharata</i> 

              (12.57.7):</p>

            <p align="center"><i>guror apy avaliptasya karyakaryam ajanatah<br>

              </i><i>utpatha-pratipannasya parityago vidhiyate</i></p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>'One is enjoined to renounce even a guru who is contaminated, 

              not knowing what is to be done and what is not to be done, and who 

              has taken to a deviant path.'</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>The phrase <i>guror api</i>, 'even a guru', surely refers to the 

              high status traditionally awarded to a spiritual preceptor.</p>

            <p>There is a further consideration. Srila Prabhupada taught the traditional 

              view that one should confirm spiritual teaching through three authorities: 

              <i>guru, sadhu</i> and <i>sastra -</i> one's own guru, other saintly 

              persons, and sacred scriptures. Thus the guru functions within a 

              cultural economy of checks and balances. </p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada institutionalised these checks and balances by 

              establishing the GBC, and indeed the body of senior Vaisnavas, as 

              a <i>sadhu</i>-force within ISKCON. It is our practical experience 

              that individual gurus may, and sometimes do, deviate from ISKCON's 

              spiritual standards, but the greater body of senior devotees has 

              been able to keep ISKCON basically on track. Of course, a similar 

              function is given to the community of the faithful in Sunni Islam 

              and in various other historical religious traditions.</p>

            <p>Finally, I will state what should be obvious, but often is not: 

              that one may go off on either side of the road. Thus, there is a 

              real danger for ISKCON, in its zeal to avoid the high-profile fall-downs 

              of the recent past, to sanitise and restrain the position of guru 

              to a point where it is no longer recognisable and, indeed, no longer 

              functions as a real spiritual force for good in the Society.</p>

            <p>Last year a desperate father wrote to me explaining that his unmarried 

              daughter had 'moved in' with a young male devotee who was my initiated 

              disciple. He asked that I order my disciple to separate from his 

              daughter. I sadly replied that in today's ISKCON, the guru can do 

              less harm, but less good as well, and that I did not have the authority 

              to so order my disciple.</p>

            <p>I conclude that the guru in Gaudiya Vaisnava culture is ideally 

              a soul surrendered to Krsna and is thereby qualified to lead the 

              community by purely representing the Lord. The guru is also one 

              with Krsna in an ontological sense, as are all other souls, but 

              always as the subordinate servant of the Lord. Within the cosmic 

              village of <i>Bhagavatam</i> culture, the guru, and even the great 

              <i>acarya</i>, functions within a system of constraints established 

              by <i>dharma</i>, <i>sastra</i> (scripture) and the examples and 

              teachings of recognised saints (<i>sadhus</i>). Thus, ISKCON's system 

              of requiring the guru to abide by, and within, a social reality 

              governed by the GBC does not intrinsically violate the tradition 

              in which the Society finds its legitimacy.</p>
