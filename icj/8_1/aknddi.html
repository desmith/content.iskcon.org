                Publisher: Oxford University Press, Oxford 1998<br>

                Hard: ISBN 0-19-825773-2<br>

                </span>One of the more ironic realisations I gained during the 

                many years of the campaign to save Bhaktivedanta Manor from closure, 

                came from articles in the various newspapers and journals covering 

                the story. It was shocking to see so many inaccuracies, major 

                errors and incongruous statements, never mind the off-balance 

                bias, in the press's portrayal of an event or situation that you 

                know intimately. If every article to which you know the background 

                is a distortion of the truth, then, by extrapolation, so might 

                be every other article in every newspaper. </p>

            </div>

            <p>It was also salutary to witness how outsiders viewed the cosy little 

              world we, as devotees, had created around ourselves - especially 

              as ISKCON had seen its specific objective as creating a microcosm 

              based on a philosophy, with related practices, which are foreign, 

              in all senses of the word, to the non-devotee of Middle England. 

              Sometimes, ignorance or prejudice colour the outsider's presentation 

              of the world of ISKCON; sometimes it arises from the devotees' own 

              portrayal of their beliefs and lifestyle; and, sometimes, ISKCON 

              really does daft things and we just don't see it. </p>

            <p>In reading Sebastian Poulter's study of the Manor Campaign (as 

              we affectionately called it), I am confronted with an academic's 

              viewpoint of a history I lived and breathed for over ten years. 

              There is no doubt that Poulter is knowledgeable, sympathetic to 

              ethnic matters and trying hard to understand the issue. Yet, I am 

              not convinced he does full credit to the aspirations of his thesis.</p>

            <p>The purpose of including the Manor study is to illustrate a broader 

              theme of how far English law is able to cope with the specific needs 

              of its ethnic minority communities. It was not my brief to read 

              the whole book and neither am I qualified to comment on Poulter's 

              analysis of the general legal issues that comprise Part I of the 

              book. Part II - 'Case Studies in Relation to Particular Groups' 

              - contains useful examples of many ethnic communities' struggles 

              to have their customs and practices accepted within the framework 

              created for British society by the various governmental authorities. 

              There are the examples of Jews and Sunday trading laws, the right 

              of gypsies to a nomadic lifestyle, Sikhs and crash helmets, the 

              demand for a separate system of personal law by Muslims, and others.</p>

            <p>As Poulter points out in the background to his chapter on Hindu 

              matters, Hindu practices are not openly visible to the wider public, 

              nor are its beliefs easily articulated or understood. (I remember 

              a dreadful explanation I tried to give to an enquiry by John Humphries 

              about whether Hindus believed there was one God or many. Fortunately, 

              he wasn't in rottweiler mode and it was an off-air conversation). 

              Even those issues that the English find so abhorrent, such as caste 

              and sati, are inconspicuous in the UK. However, the one thing that 

              Hindus are seen to do, and which gets them embroiled in trouble 

              throughout the UK, is going to temples and celebrating big festivals. 

              Some local councils have been exemplary in accommodating the Hindu 

              community in their area, but many others have made gestures of concern 

              while maintaining a covert policy to contain the community's aspirations 

              for places of worship and social facilities. The provision of temple 

              facilities has certainly been the main legal problem faced by the 

              Hindu community in the UK.</p>

            <p>The case of Bhaktivedanta Manor was by far the longest running 

              and highest profile of all the temple problems and it deserves its 

              place in Poulter's book. It was the biggest for two reasons. One 

              is that we made it so. The other is that Bhaktivedanta Manor is 

              and has always been a unique facility within the consciousness of 

              British Hindus. Poulter captures this in his description of how 

              the standards of worship and the committed lifestyle of the devotees 

              proved especially attractive to Hindus newly arrived in the UK. 

              I was a member of the executive committee of the National Council 

              of Hindu Temples in the UK from 1980 to 1995. We regularly discussed 

              planning problems for both existing and proposed temples. There 

              was genuine outrage at any attempt to curtail the worship at the 

              Manor and many saw it as a test case for Hinduism in Britain, fearing 

              that if the Manor was not successful other temples might also come 

              under threat.</p>

            <p>There are various subthemes that arise in Poulter's background 

              notes which warrant further and deeper exploration. One of my favourites 

              is how Hinduism has evolved since its arrival in the UK and the 

              role that ISKCON has played in this. Since his intention is to concentrate 

              on the legal wrangling, Sebastian Poulter mentions this only in 

              passing. However, I had always felt that such matters were crucial 

              to the Manor case because the authorities at local or national level 

              needed to be aware of the changing nature of Hinduism and its evolving 

              needs. Hertsmere Borough Council (HBC), the Manor's local government 

              authority, engaged an academic to advise it on Hinduism and the 

              public inquiry inspectors liked to be able to rely on the evidence 

              of such scholars - more so than on the testimony of the adherents 

              themselves. This caused ISKCON difficulties on occasion. One example 

              is revealed in Poulter's description of the role of the temple in 

              Hinduism: 'Visits to the temple (<i>mandir</i>) are peripheral rather 

              than central to the practice of Hinduism and indeed in early Hindu 

              scriptures and epic works there is no mention of temples.' Imagine 

              how a hostile adjudicator would pounce on that tit-bit of authoritative 

              wisdom. </p>

            <p>Whatever the ancient history, Hindus in Britain today rely on both 

              home and temple. In India, temples exist as shrines mainly for regular 

              or occasional pilgrimage. In Britain, the temple is an oasis of 

              Hindu life amidst a less favourable environment and has, therefore, 

              become the centre for community's religious observance, cultural 

              expression and social scene - all vital to the preservation of a 

              religion that is holistic by nature. Whereas temple worship in India 

              often seems an individualistic activity, British Hindus tend to 

              gather at temples for congregational worship during the <i>arati 

              </i>ceremonies. This has some precedent in India, particularly in 

              the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, of which ISKCON is part. There may 

              also be an inadvertent synchronisation with Christian forms of worship 

              as Hindus in Britain learn to adjust the pattern of their observances 

              from the lunar-based Hindu calendar to the strict weekly cycle of 

              Western life. If you are running a small business there is often 

              only Sunday evening available for temple visits.</p>

            <p>However, I would have delighted in calling Mr Poulter as our first 

              witness at the public inquiry to hear him define <i>'matha'</i> 

              as a theological college. We too used this definition, when in1973 

              the Manor was granted permission (under Section 53 of the Planning 

              Act) to be a theological college in connection with the religion 

              of Krsna Consciousness. At that time we requested it be allowed 

              to function as a <i>matha</i> and not be judged in terms of a Christian 

              theological college, which is an entirely different entity. I still 

              regard this as an arguable contention. However, I believe it serves 

              Poulter's theme by illustrating the difficulty English law faces 

              in handling the language, institutions and customs of newly arrived 

              ethnic groups.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it appears that Poulter does not wish to enter into 

              such analysis, preferring instead to précis the legal procedures, 

              debates and decisions. His summary is undoubtedly important, as 

              it documents Britain's legal framework processing a complex ethnic 

              issue. Despite my opening reservations about reporting accuracy, 

              I have little complaint about what Poulter actually writes, but 

              his omission of the simultaneous political and social history of 

              the Manor Campaign leaves us with an incomplete and distorted vision. 

              It thus fails to reveal the most useful lessons of the whole episode. 

              No historian would try to reconstruct the full picture of the past 

              solely from legal documents. Sebastian Poulter is not a historian, 

              he is a reader of law, but his subject here is the law in action; 

              and the law, particularly in the field of planning and especially 

              in relation to ethnic issues, does not operate in a vacuum, cut 

              off from other human concerns and motivations. </p>

            <p>I decided to establish whether his other reports adhered so tightly 

              to the legal machinations, and found they did not. In the section 

              on Sikhs being excluded from wearing helmets, Poulter includes personal 

              case studies, campaign efforts and political developments. Although 

              it is true that the case involved an amendment to an Act of Parliament, 

              those who were privy to the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the 

              Manor case can attest that the whole case was a homogenous blend 

              of politics, NIMBYism, human rights, social action and legal squabbling. 

            </p>

            <p>Many of the legal arguments put forward by ISKCON in the many local 

              public inquiries, court appeals and to the European Commission of 

              Human Rights had questionable merit and were easily dismissed. If 

              anything, that demonstrated our struggle to hang our hat on any 

              legal hook. At no point in the domestic hearings did we feel we 

              were able to address the religious issues adequately. This is the 

              real failing of English law. In the USA, the matter would never 

              have been contested. Zoning laws there are often as onerous as the 

              English ones, but they cannot override the constitutional protection 

              of freedom of religion.</p>

            <p>Only in our appeal to the European Commission were we allowed to 

              raise rights of religious practice as a matter of consideration. 

              Even then, we knew we were on shaky ground with some of our contentions 

              because of the discretion that is afforded to member states in applying 

              their own laws, particularly planning decisions. The Commission 

              found by a majority decision that our appeals were 'manifestly unfounded', 

              which is a term-of-art used by the Commission for any appeal it 

              rejects. This expression is an example of the black-and-white nature 

              of legal decisions in a confrontational system. There is no room 

              for 'maybes'.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, as Poulter explains, each planning inquiry boiled down 

              to weighing two contrary planning considerations, need and damage, 

              against each another. Did the needs of the Hindu community of Britain 

              to worship at Bhaktivedanta Manor outweigh the material damage to 

              the locality as ascertained by consideration of the objectives of 

              planning (particularly Green Belt) policies? The inspector in the 

              first inquiry concluded they did not and pressed for the closure 

              of the Manor within six months. He came to the same judgement, of 

              damage outweighing need, in the appeal for the new temple at Elstree 

              (on a site chosen and negotiated for, and on behalf of, ISKCON by 

              Hertsmere Council). The Secretary of State concurred on both counts, 

              but extended the compliance period for ending public worship at 

              the Manor to two years. The government press release on the day 

              of the decision was a masterpiece of spin doctoring. In effect, 

              it said that with these decisions, the Hindu community had a wonderful 

              opportunity to create an even better temple for themselves somewhere 

              else.</p>

            <p>However, when ISKCON presented a revised case for worship at the 

              Manor based on the creation of a new road access by-passing local 

              residences, the inspector and the Secretary of State now weighed 

              the Hindus' needs as greater than the damage to others' interests 

              and the effect on the Green Belt. I would have liked Poulter to 

              delve into this <i>volte-face </i>and juxtapose the contrary statements 

              in the government's decision letters of 1990 and 1996. If he had, 

              perhaps his conclusions would have been different.</p>

            <p>However, Poulter's rather simplistic view of the resolution of 

              the Manor case leads him to this conclusion: 'In the end, the planning 

              legal system proved capable of settling the dispute through the 

              flexible application of its ordinary planning principles, without 

              any need for a specific provision designed for the exclusive benefit 

              of ISKCON or Hindus.' The big question for me on reviewing this 

              chapter is, 'Do I agree with this statement?' The answer is a big 

              'maybe'. Yes, the Manor situation was resolved within the existing 

              legal framework. But, no, it was not on the basis of specific consideration 

              of religious needs. If anything, the case highlights the arbitrary 

              and discretionary nature of English planning law (which is not news 

              to anyone who has had to confront the system - even for a porch 

              extension). This is my biggest problem with the chapter. Poulter 

              appears to record the legal processes as if they operated like coldly 

              objective computer calculations. At no point does he note any personal 

              consideration or subjectivity on the part of the adjudicators. The 

              inspectors at the 1988-9 and the 1994-5 enquiries were as different 

              as chalk and cheese. We knew before he even sat down at the inquiry 

              that we should petition to have the first inspector removed. In 

              his mind, we were clearly wrong and had to go. In contrast, the 

              Secretary of State's replacement inspector in 1994 was a much warmer 

              personality with an even-minded disposition.</p>

            <p>Although the inspectors had a duty to record and dissect the legal 

              arguments, planning law is distinguished from other legal judgements 

              in that a politician, the Secretary of State for the Environment, 

              makes the final decision. Politicians do not have the objective 

              status of judges and cannot fully divorce themselves from related 

              political considerations. We had our connections in the corridors 

              of power and were well aware of what concerns the politicians were 

              balancing - and it was not the legal arguments. The then Conservative 

              government had no intention of disappointing the Home Counties voter, 

              but still hoped to salvage some credibility among Hindus who had 

              always been natural Tory supporters. They were also keeping an eye 

              on the ongoing Manor Campaign and, especially, its transformation 

              into the Defence Movement. </p>

            <p>One government advisor on ethnic matters told me that in 1990 he 

              was asked by the Department of the Environment whether the Hindus 

              would riot if a negative decision on the Manor was released. The 

              answer was, 'No, Muslims might, but not the Hindus.' Chris Patten 

              went ahead with the decision. Sure enough, there were no serious 

              demonstrations at that time - much to the shame of many Manor devotees. 

              I always felt it unfair that the Hindu community's needs were mostly 

              neglected by the government. Hindus saw mosques popping up everywhere, 

              but they couldn't get permission for temples. There was not just 

              disparity between the ethnic and the majority religions; it existed 

              in the treatment of individual ethnic groups. At one point, I petitioned 

              the Archbishop of Canterbury that the needs of a community that 

              played the game and acted impeccably should be given prime consideration 

              as an encouragement towards better social behaviour. That message 

              was unheeded during the life of the Campaign, and the Hindu community 

              turned to Gandhi-style civil disobedience. The biggest events in 

              the Campaign calendar came in 1994 - the first on 16 March, the 

              day the enforcement notice to close the Manor for public worship 

              took effect. Thirty-six thousand Hindus marched through London and 

              held a short sit-down on the road outside Westminster. I have never 

              seen the Hindu community so jubilant as on that day - they had acted 

              as one community and were proud of having stood up for themselves. 

              They had such fun that two months later ten thousand of them repeated 

              the protest with a prolonged sit-down that stopped all traffic in 

              front of Westminster for ninety minutes.</p>

            <p>While the Campaign was heating up, ISKCON was appearing more conciliatory, 

              with a proposal for a compromise solution that was easily appreciated 

              by anyone with a mind for resolving the conflict. This was a stick-and-carrot 

              approach to the politicians. Frankly, the recital of legal arguments 

              for worship at the Manor on the basis of new access was a charade, 

              necessary only to assist the politicians in justifying the grant 

              of permission - if they so desired. Another government advisor informed 

              me how in 1996 the Secretary of State showed him two decision letters 

              on the Manor case - one approving and the other dismissing the appeal. 

              The advisor was asked which of them should be handed down.</p>

            <p>Sebastian Poulter calls it 'flexible application', but planning 

              decisions are largely discretionary, arbitrary and prone to political 

              considerations. The Manor case does not demonstrate that the English 

              planning laws enshrine religious considerations, but they are malleable 

              enough to allow the authorities scope to make any decision that 

              suits them. All that is required is one sentence: 'I have considered 

              the religious and cultural needs of such-and-such a community and 

              I attach very great importance to them and I conclude that they 

              do/do not* (*delete as applicable) outweigh the needs of whoever 

              and the relevant planning policies.'</p>

            <p>The voting at HBC meetings had always been strictly along party 

              lines (except for one Tory councillor who confided that he was voting 

              for the temple because he could not support the racism of his own 

              group). The timing of the release of the final decision to approve 

              the new access road for the Manor was significant. The week before, 

              Hertsmere had been lost from Conservative control to Labour, the 

              latter having always pledged to approve the Manor application. It 

              was subsequently announced on local television that representatives 

              of the Manor and the Labour group were to meet. That afternoon, 

              the government stole Labour's thunder by faxing through their green-light 

              decision.</p>

            <p>In presenting the legal history of the Manor case, Sebastian Poulter 

              has told the truth, and practically nothing but the truth. But, 

              the whole truth? That is much more revealing - and is yet to be 

              told.</p>
