            <p><i>The status of women in ISKCON has long been a contentious issue. 

              Is ISKCON's attitude to women a reflection of Vaisnava values or 

              is it perversion of them? Are ISKCON members following Srila Prabhupada's 

              instructions or manipulating them to support their own agendas? 

              This year, for the first time, ISKCON's Governing Body Commission 

              (GBC) heard presentations by representatives of the ISKCON Women's 

              Ministry. We present here a brief history of women in ISKCON, the 

              presentations made at the GBC meetings and the resolutions that 

              they prompted. Future reports will be made on the effectiveness 

              of these meetings and the resolutions.</i></p>

            <p>In New York, in the spring of 1966, shortly after Srila Prabhupada 

              had coined the acronym 'ISKCON' and had laughed playfully with the 

              new word, he initiated the legal work of incorporating the society. 

              Stephen Goldsmith, a young Jewish lawyer, fascinated by the idea 

              of setting up a religious corporation for an Indian <i>svami,</i> 

              began to help. On 11 July 1966, Mr Goldsmith came to Prabhupada's 

              lecture and <i>kirtana</i> at 26 Second Avenue to get signatures 

              from the trustees for the new society. To the surprise of the people 

              gathered, after Srila Prabhupada's lecture, Mr Goldsmith stood up 

              and made a short announcement asking for signers on an incorporation 

              document for the Svami's new religious movement. The first trustees 

              - those sympathisers with enough reverence towards the Svami to 

              want to help him - were Michael Grant, his girlfriend Jan Marie 

              Campanella, and James Greene. </p>

            <p>Two months later, on Srila Prabhupada's Vyasa-puja day - 9 September 

              1966 - Srila Prabhupada held the first initiations in ISKCON. Michael 

              Grant became Mukunda Dasa and Jan became Janaki Dasi, Srila Prabhupada's 

              first woman initiate and one of three ISKCON trustees. Three days 

              later, Prabhupada performed a marriage ceremony for them. In those 

              early years, Prabhupada established a personal, warm rapport with 

              each of his disciples and nurtured them in spiritual life. This 

              was true of both men and women. Excerpts from letters that Srila 

              Prabhupada wrote to Janaki over the years reveal how he spiritually 

              transformed her life: 'I am so much obliged to you for your devotion 

              and affection for me. I thought of you all throughout my journey 

              from San Francisco to New York and I was praying to Lord Krishna 

              for your more and more advancement in Krishna consciousness.'<sup><a href="#1d">1</a><a name="1"></a> 

              </sup>'Every minute I think of you and as you asked me to go to 

              San Francisco while returning from India, I am trying to fulfill 

              my promise.'<sup><a href="#2d">2</a><a name="2"></a> </sup>'With 

              the greatest satisfaction I have just now read over your nicely 

              composed and hand-written letter ... and I thank you so much for 

              the kind sentiments you have expressed therein. I had also been 

              thinking of you because you were thinking of me, but as your letter 

              has arrived first it is for me to answer it. Actually, I always 

              think of you as my naughty daughter and from the start of this movement, 

              you and your very good husband have always shown to be very sincere 

              and important members of our society. So I know that both of your 

              services are most sincere and I will always appreciate this.'<sup><a href="#3d">3</a><a name="3"></a> 

              </sup>'I was thinking of you since about a week why you are silent, 

              and all of a sudden I got your letter with a golden ring enclosed. 

              It was so much ecstatic. I thank you very much for your kind presentation 

              which you have given ... immediately upon receipt of this ring I 

              pushed it on my finger, and it is very nice.'<sup><a href="#4d">4</a><a name="4"></a> 

              </sup>'I lost my mother when I was only fourteen years old. So I 

              didn't get much of my mother's affection in my childhood. But in 

              my old age, Krsna has given me so many young mothers to take care 

              of me.'<sup><a href="#5d">5</a><a name="5"></a> </sup>'... even 

              I am far away, as you say you are remembering me, so also I am remembering 

              you, and in that sense we are never separated.'<sup><a href="#6d">6</a><a name="6"></a><a name="6"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p>As Srila Prabhupada expressed fatherly emotions towards his disciples, 

              sometimes addressing them as 'my dear sons and daughters', so the 

              early temples that he established had a family spirit. Women served 

              side by side with their male counterparts, opening centres, giving 

              class, singing and chanting, performing varieties of other service, 

              and personally caring for their elderly spiritual father. However, 

              as the movement grew, the camaraderie of the early years dwindled. 

              A growing number of Srila Prabhupada's male disciples accepted the 

              renounced order of <i>sannyasa;</i> and subsequently devotee women 

              were no longer viewed as partners in a spiritual renaissance, rather 

              they were categorised as personifications of the illusory energy, 

              Mayadevi, who threatened to cause men to deviate from their noble 

              spiritual quest. Women were tolerated more than welcomed. In some 

              temples they were relegated to the back of the temple room where 

              they would not distract the men (rather than the side, where they 

              could see the Deities without peering over the heads of their male 

              counterparts). Generally, women were no longer asked to give classes, 

              to lead <i>kirtanas </i>or to manage. They had to sit through many 

              discouraging and disparaging lectures in which the intelligence, 

              motives and capabilities of womankind were criticised or scorned.</p>

            <p>Women's <i>asramas</i> began to close. Those who were provided 

              <i>asrama</i> facility were often expected to perform disproportionate 

              service or sell paraphernalia on the streets for the Society's income 

              (thus the evolution of the infamous women's parties). Women's role 

              as mother was also called into question, and patience lacked with 

              women who refused to take up temple service rather than care for 

              their children. These conditions were exacerbated by the complete 

              social and financial dependence each temple resident had on the 

              management.</p>

            <p>By 1974, this mood reached a zenith: women were now unwelcome. 

              Tamala Krsna Goswami writes of the Radha-Damodara Travelling Sankirtana 

              Party (RDTSKP), which he led: </p>

            <p>The [male] visitors felt strengthened by the atmosphere of renunciation, 

              not so easily available in the temples, where there were so many 

              women. Visnujana strictly maintained a principle of not preaching 

              to women. Seeing that I was bent on making new devotees, men or 

              women, he had sagaciously directed, 'Whenever you make a woman a 

              devotee, you lose one man.' [Referring to the fact that women had 

              to be married eventually, and there was the possibility that the 

              men would become absorbed in household life and thus be diverted 

              from preaching activities.] At least for our party of <i>sannyasis</i> 

              and <i>brahmacaris</i> living on a bus, it was sober and practical 

              advice. (Tamala Krsna Goswami, ch. 13)</p>

            <p>Several years of this kind of preaching created a major controversy 

              between <i>grhasthas </i>(householders) and <i>sannyasis</i>. In 

              Sridhama Mayapura on 14 March 1976 it was reported to Srila Prabhupada 

              that: '<i>Brahmacaris</i> were being told that if they remained 

              in the temples they would end up married, entangled in family affairs, 

              and therefore useless. On the other hand, they could accept the 

              alternative of a carefree life, travelling and preaching with the 

              RDTSKP buses.' However, 'Tamala Krsna Maharaja was adamant, defending 

              his party and their record-breaking book distribution. He proclaimed 

              the accusations as outright lies.' Srila Prabhupada settled the 

              issue by 'wonderfully preaching to everyone that it does not matter 

              what one is, one can do anything and go anywhere for Krsna. We are 

              not to discriminate against anyone on the basis of external dress. 

              One is to be judged on the basis of one's advancement in Krsna consciousness.' 

              (Hari Sauri Dasa, Vol. 1, Ch. 9) </p>

            <p>Although Srila Prabhupada's words were unequivocal and from that 

              day the Radha- Damodara Party never again had the same mood or influence, 

              the attitude towards women in the Krsna conscious movement was never 

              restored to the original, family-like warmth that Srila Prabhupada 

              had instituted in the early days. While the standards and expectations 

              regarding women varied from place to place, in general women were 

              not considered for any managerial positions, their counsel was not 

              sought in any decision-making, they were still obliged to stand 

              in the back of the temple, they were not asked to lecture in the 

              temples, and women as a class were still denigrated in lectures. 

              There was no system of grievance resolution or channel for communication 

              when difficulties and exploitation arose. </p>

            <p>Then, in 1977, the Society's spiritual leader, father, solution 

              provider and counsellor passed away from this world.</p>

            <p>Times were difficult. 'As a single woman living in the temples 

              in the late 70's and 80's I witnessed a social demoralisation of 

              women and families,' recounts one female devotee. 'Women acted more 

              and more as men. Men lost touch with their feminine qualities. Children 

              felt isolated. Growing numbers of families left behind their temple 

              services and moved out of the temples, sometimes forced, to seek 

              stability and financial independence elsewhere. Domestic violence 

              was on the rise. Conditions for women living in the temples became 

              abysmal, and the terms "protection" and "exploitation" seemed practically 

              interchangeable.'</p>

            <p>Yet, through the difficulties, rays of hope began to emerge. When 

              an elderly woman of 70 travelled from the United States to Mayapura 

              for the yearly festival there, she was told to stay on the roof 

              of one of the buildings. That night brought a downpour. Many were 

              outraged. A letter was written to the Mayapura authorities decrying 

              this travesty. Women galvanized their efforts and thinking and began 

              to seek support, which they found in the Communications arm of the 

              Society. Discussions ensued, papers were written, and <i>Priti Laksanam</i>, 

              a publication of uncensored presentation, was established by Pranada 

              Dasi.</p>

            <p>Other developments were afoot. In 1992 a conference was held by 

              ISKCON Communications on the subject of women in ISKCON at the German 

              farm (Nava-jiyada-nrsimha-ksetra), then widely viewed as a bastion 

              of male dominance. Ravindra Svarupa Dasa gave an influential address 

              at this conference. Within a year the German National Council decided 

              to reserve a third of its seats for women and by 1994 three German 

              temples had women serving as temple presidents.</p>

            <p>In 1995 Harikesa Svami, at that time GBC for Germany, declared 

              that 'where there is discrimination, it should be abolished.'<sup><a href="#7d">7</a><a name="7"></a> 

              </sup>He stressed that women be given equal facility in temple life 

              and be respected according to their position. This statement cleared 

              the way for abolition of such practices as women being left to stand 

              at the back of the temple room during <i>aratis</i>, being ignored 

              for any management position or not being invited to give <i>Bhagavatam 

              </i>class in major European temples such as Radhadesh (Belgium), 

              Bhaktivedanta Manor (UK) and Heidelberg. </p>

            <p>In the US, women were attending the North American GBC and temple 

              presidents' meetings. After a moving presentation on the women's 

              issues by a mixed panel of men and women, Sudharma Dasi was elected 

              an executive officer for ISKCON North America. That position entitled 

              her to be a guest of the international GBC body (Governing Body 

              Commission, the highest managerial arm of ISKCON) in Mayapura. There, 

              with the help of several male GBC members, she formed the International 

              Women's Ministry, which was officially approved as an ISKCON ministry 

              in 1996. Later, Malati Dasi, with the help of the Women's Ministry 

              and the support of her local GBC, was recommended as a regional 

              GBC candidate. Together the two began attending the International 

              GBC meetings in Mayapura.</p>

            <p>The Women's Ministry began holding conferences in the United States 

              and Europe. These conferences afforded women the opportunity for 

              training, uplifting positive association within ISKCON, and dialectic 

              experience. Women's Ministry conferences are held annually in the 

              US with an average of more than 150 attendees. Many attended these 

              conferences, including male and female leaders of ISKCON, professional 

              counsellors and professors of religious study.</p>

            <p>Sudharma's repeated requests for the GBC to examine the situation 

              of women in ISKCON was postponed year after year until, in September 

              1999, a crisis brought the topic to the forefront. One morning, 

              just before <i>mangala-arati</i> (the first ceremony of the day, 

              at 4:30 a.m.), in ISKCON's International Krsna-Balarama Temple in 

              Vrndavana, the <i>brahmacaris</i> formed a human chain, linking 

              arm-and-arm, to prevent the women from taking close <i>darsana</i> 

              (view) of the Deities. Some women tried to break through this chain 

              and were physically rebuffed. When news of this went out on the 

              Internet, devotees throughout the world were alarmed. Dozens of 

              versions and hundreds of opinions about what happened were exchanged. 

              Using this incident as a catalyst, the Women's Ministry was able 

              to put the women's topic on the table at the annual international 

              GBC meeting in Mayapura. On 1 March 2000, nine women spoke to the 

              assembled GBC representatives. It was the first time in the movement's 

              30-year history that such a testimony was be heard.</p>

            <p>The presentations that follow will lend insight into the struggle 

              of the women of the Krsna consciousness movement - a struggle that 

              has encountered and helped synthesise the apparent contradictions 

              between Eastern and Western lifestyle and culture.</p>
