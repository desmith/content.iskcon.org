            <h4 align="left"><b class="maintextsubhead">Prabhupada's Ladies and 

              Soul Concern<br>
              </b><b><span class="maintextsubhead">Presentation by</span> <a href="biodata.html#vd" class="maintextsubhead">Visakha 
              Dasi</a></b></h4>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada left us with clear directives for women: in every 

              stage of her life a woman must be protected, either by her father, 

              her husband or her grown son. A woman is dependent and chaste; she 

              is an expert cook and a faithful wife.</p>

            <p>Are Prabhupada's female followers changing these clear guidelines?</p>

            <p>The women who today are examining the mood and restrictions that 

              some male members of ISKCON have imposed or would impose on them, 

              are doing so on the strength of Prabhupada's teachings and personal 

              example. Whatever contradictions we may find in his teachings and 

              example are only apparent. Closer examination and realisation will 

              reveal that Prabhupada's legacy is harmonious in all its aspects, 

              including the role of women. It is only in the mature reconciliation 

              of apparent contradictions that Srila Prabhupada's priceless legacy 

              will be left balanced and complete for future generations of his 

              followers.</p>

            <p>Apparent contradictions repeatedly originate from statements concerning 

              the principles of <i>bhakti-yoga </i>on one side and <i>varnasrama 

              </i>on the other.</p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada describes <i>bhakti </i>in this way: '<i>Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam</i>. 

              You have to understand that "I am not this body. I am neither Indian, 

              nor American, nor Russian. I am part and parcel of God. Therefore 

              my business is to serve God." This is called <i>bhakti</i>. That 

              is the definition of <i>bhakti</i>. <i>Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam </i>... 

              . The dirty things are within my heart, so if we cleanse our heart, 

              then we become free from this designation.'<sup><a href="#1d">1</a><a name="1"></a><a name="1"></a> 

              </sup></p>

            <p>Prabhupada's personal <i>lila </i>exemplifies his own pristine 

              heart. For example: </p>

            <p>Jadurani helped Govinda Dasi gather flowers and the two girls talked 

              together. Both had heard the men say that women were less intelligent, 

              and they felt discouraged. Later Govinda Dasi told Prabhupada about 

              the problem. 'Is it true,' she asked, 'that because we are women 

              we won't make advancement as quickly as the <i>brahmacaris</i>?'</p>

            <p>'Yes,' Prabhupada answered. 'If you think of yourselves as women, 

              how will you make any advancement? You must see yourself as spirit 

              soul, eternal servant of Krsna.' (Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, 1993, 

              Vol. 3, p. 150)</p>

            <p>Prabhupada was smiling and looking directly from one devotee to 

              another. 'I want each of you to go and start a center. What is the 

              difficulty? Take one <i>mrdanga</i>. Then another person will come 

              and join you - he will take <i>karatalas </i>...' 'The girls also?' 

              Rukmini asked. 'There is no harm,' Prabhupada said. 'Krsna does 

              not make distinction - female dress or male dress. I mean to say, 

              the female body is weaker, but spiritually the body does not matter. 

              In the absence of Lord Nityananda, His wife, Jahnava Devi, was preaching. 

              First you must understand the philosophy. You must be prepared to 

              answer questions. Krsna will give you intelligence. Just like I 

              was not prepared to answer all these questions, but Krsna gives 

              intelligence.' (Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, 1991, pp. 146-7)</p>

            <p>And, in his purport to <i>Adi-lila</i> 7.31-2, Srila Prabhupada 

              emphasises the same principle: '... those girls are not ordinary 

              girls but are as good as their brothers who are preaching Krsna 

              consciousness.' (Prabhupada, 1987, p. 24)</p>

            <p>Referring to <i>varnasrama</i>, on a morning walk in Chicago in 

              1975, Srila Prabhupada said:</p>

            <p>'Our policy should be that at Dallas <i>gurukula </i>we shall create 

              first-class men. And we shall teach the girls two things: how to 

              become chaste and faithful to their husband and how to cook nicely.' 

              While Prabhupada and the group of devotees returned to the car, 

              the topic changed to the political troubles in India. Prabhupada 

              commented, 'If Indira Gandhi takes my advice, then I can keep her 

              on the post, and she can do greater service to India. Immediately 

              the whole public will give her support ... . But to remain the leader 

              she requires spiritual knowledge, otherwise it will be another disaster. 

              If she wants to remain leader then she must be a spiritual person. 

              She must become a Vaisnavi.' (Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, 1993, Vol. 

              6, p. 67)</p>

            <p>Here, Prabhupada first explains the traditional, home-centred role 

              for women in the <i>varnasrama </i>system, and then explains how 

              a female leader can best remain in power - through her development 

              in <i>bhakti-yoga</i>. So, as conservative as one may consider Prabhupada's 

              stance regarding women in the <i>varnasrama </i>system, one will 

              find Prabhupada's stance equally liberal regarding women in <i>bhakti-yoga</i>.</p>

            <p>From a letter: 'The actual system is that the husband is the spiritual 

              master to his wife, but if the wife can bring her husband into practicing 

              this process [of Krsna consciousness], then it is all right that 

              the husband accepts the wife as the spiritual master. Caitanya Mahaprabhu 

              has said that anyone who knows the science of Krsna should be accepted 

              as spiritual master, regardless of any material so-called qualifications, 

              such as rich or poor, man or woman, or <i>brahmana </i>or <i>sudra</i>.'<sup><a href="#2d">2</a><a name="2"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p>From a conversation: 'In the material world, is there any prohibition 

              that a woman cannot become a professor? If she is qualified, she 

              can become a professor. What is the wrong there? She must be qualified. 

              That is the position. So similarly, if the woman understands Krsna 

              consciousness perfectly, she can become <i>guru.</i>'<sup><a href="#3d">3</a><a name="3"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p>Our duty, as the custodians of Srila Prabhupada's legacy, is to 

              synthesise the principles of <i>bhakti-yoga </i>on one side, with 

              the principles of <i>varnasrama </i>on the other. If we are presently 

              forbidding certain services to qualified Vaisnavis, we may be quickly 

              gliding towards the caste system, the convoluted and stultifying 

              misapplication of Lord Krsna's divine social arrangement - <i>daiva-varnasrama</i>.</p>

            <p>Due to this perversion of Krsna's plan, in India today we may find 

              a child born to simple labouring parents who would make an able 

              leader, but is forbidden, or a child born of priests who wants to 

              farm but cannot, or a farmer's child who is a natural scholar but 

              is obliged to raise okra. These are travesties. Do we want ISKCON 

              to go in this direction? By not protecting the right of a woman 

              to serve according to her capacities and by squeezing her into a 

              box that all women are obliged to fit in, we follow this direction 

              by default, unless we take definite steps to change. The rigid society 

              that refuses to accept individual proclivities - whether in women 

              or in men - harms itself and those it suppresses. In Krsna's divine 

              arrangement one's duties are determined by one's activities (<i>karma</i>) 

              and qualities (<i>guna</i>), not by one's birth (<i>janma</i>).</p>

            <p>In November 1972, when Srila Prabhupada returned to Vrndavana with 

              his Western disciples, he enjoined the caste conscious <i>brahmanas 

              </i>and <i>gosvamis</i>, 'Our purpose should be to serve Krsna with 

              our senses purified of false designations. This is the transcendental 

              stage. A Vaisnava should not be considered European or American. 

              No. ... We have to become designation-less. We should forget all 

              these false identities. ... So many nonsense things are going on 

              for want of actual spiritual education. ... This Krsna consciousness 

              movement proposes that nobody should think of himself as belonging 

              to a certain family, sect or nation. All these designations have 

              created havoc in the world.'<sup><a href="#4d">4</a><a name="4"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p>Similarly, discriminatory attitudes towards women have created, 

              and will continue to create, havoc in ISKCON. As, in 1971, Srila 

              Prabhupada requested the Brijbasis<sup><a href="#5d">5</a><a name="5"></a><a name="5"></a> 

              </sup>not to see his disciples in terms of their birth, so today 

              - 29 years later - Prabhupada's ladies request the gentlemen in 

              his Society not to see them in terms of their birth. Please do not 

              offer us sexism in the name of Krsna consciousness.</p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada offered qualified women, like qualified men, services 

              commensurate with their abilities, and part of these women's qualifications 

              was that they were protected, dependent, faithful and chaste. Thus 

              Prabhupada's instructions about women and his practical example 

              in relation to women have always been in harmony.</p>

            <p>Women who are encouraged rather than suppressed will, by the grace 

              of Krsna, develop a keen sense of propriety and act in such a way 

              that pushes on Krsna's mission. Srila Prabhupada often quoted the 

              aphorism that 'Men are like butter and women are like fire. In the 

              presence of fire, butter melts.' As far as is practical, women and 

              men should remain separate and make gradual advancement in Krsna 

              consciousness. In this way, the woman's fire becomes not a fire 

              to melt butter but, due to the purity of her intent, a fire of knowledge, 

              a fire that burns ignorance to ashes. The flames of such a fire 

              can consume the fire of lust that threatens to burn every unmindful 

              conditioned soul. And the man's butter becomes the butter that is 

              stolen away by a naughty, young bluish-hued boy.</p>

            <p>Julius Lipner, a British scholar of Hindu studies at Cambridge 

              University, writes: 'ISKCON needs all the help it can get in the 

              years ahead. Unless it succeeds in convincing the female devotees 

              that they have an equally important role to play - not only physically, 

              but also intellectually and spiritually if they so desire - an immense 

              resource will be wasted; more important, ISKCON's prospects for 

              the future will be seriously undermined. It seems to me ... that 

              the role of women must be reconstructed in ISKCON.' (Lipner, p. 

              24)</p>

            <p>In his purport to <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>9.32, Srila Prabhupada emphatically 

              states, ' ... in devotional service there is no discrimination between 

              lower and higher classes of people. In the material conception of 

              life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in the transcendental 

              service of the Lord, there are not.' (Prabhupada, 1989, p. 498) 

              Similarly, in a letter he writes, 'So far your question regarding 

              women, I have always accepted the service of women without discrimination.'<sup><a href="#6d">6</a><a name="6"></a>&nbsp;</sup></p>

            <p>Our basic point is one of common sense: that within the Krsna consciousness 

              movement, individuals, whether male or female, accept duties according 

              to their qualities and activities and do those duties as an offering 

              to the Lord. This is a fundamental principle of a peaceful, co-operative, 

              spiritual society of fulfilled individuals, and as it manifests 

              in our Society, dignity and respect for all women will manifest 

              with it. ISKCON will have begun to heal its heart.</p>
