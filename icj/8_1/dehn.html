            <p>For some years now, having been in contact with the International 

              Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), particularly with its 

              Berlin chapter, it has been of interest to me to observe and experience 

              a process of opening to honest communication. ISKCON, in sharp contrast 

              to some other movements, has been ready to dig into its own past 

              and identify dark points, expose them to the greater public and 

              bear the consequences in legal and personal regards. On top of that, 

              the departure of Harikesa Swami in 1998 threw ISKCON into unprecedented 

              dynamics close to the danger of a major split. This certainly must 

              have been a painful process. </p>

            <p>ISKCON has advanced into a new stage of opening itself up with 

              this paper by Saunaka Rsi Dasa. The paper clarifies ISKCON's relation 

              to people of faith in God, including a concise 'Statement on Relating 

              with People of Faith in God', and supplies theological arguments, 

              mostly from the writings of Srila Prabhupada. My comments shall 

              focus on a couple of points.</p>

            <p>When ISKCON expresses that other approaches to God, other ways 

              of faith, need to be recognised and respected as bearing spiritual 

              worth, ongoing encounters are encouraged. This is emphasised in 

              Part One of the Statement regarding a broad range of potential partners 

              in dialogue, not necessarily religious movements. When, in Part 

              Three, it is stated that no one religion holds a monopoly on the 

              truth, this is an insight that could well be written into the diary 

              of some Christians. Anyway, we will have to see the concrete encounters 

              and have verified statements in daily life!</p>

            <p>The respect towards people of other faiths (mentioned in Part Four) 

              also includes the recognition that other faiths are such and not 

              just shades of Krsna consciousness, as was suggested by the Rettershof 

              talks (Christ, Krischto, Krsna). Identifications of Christ with 

              Krsna, or other forms of embracement, will not be accepted by (most) 

              Christian counterparts (certainly not by the author of this article), 

              and will have to give way to realistic dialogues and exchanges on 

              various theological issues, which will result in fruitful revelations 

              of differences and commonalities. Exchanges like these are possible, 

              as the Wiesbaden conference of January 1994 has shown. The decisive 

              differences of the various religious traditions need to be named 

              and affirmed. I see the preparedness to this attitude in the following 

              (from the 'Guidelines for Approaching Members of Other Faiths'): 

              'Give members of other faiths the opportunity to freely express 

              their sincerely held beliefs and convictions. Allow members of other 

              faiths to define themselves in their own language and own culture 

              without imposing definitions upon them, thus avoiding comparing 

              their practice with our ideals.' This, in my understanding, expresses 

              a clear progress from former positions. Moreover, there is a need 

              to clarify ISKCON's position within Vedic and Hindu culture. The 

              paper stresses the Gaudiya Vaisnava <i>sampradaya </i>tradition, 

              a monotheistic one, and will have to update its arguments towards 

              the Advaita Vedanta. It needs to clarify whether the previous polemic 

              by Srila Prabhupada regarding Vedanta monism is still valid or not. 

              In case there is still a critical line, the first partner for 'interreligious 

              dialogue' might be a Vedantic theologian. What kind of God do we 

              encounter in ISKCON? Isn't Krsna consciousness very close to Advaitic 

              <i>atman-brahman</i> ideas? These are questions that I will be looking 

              for in future encounters offered by Saunaka Rsi Dasa.</p>

            <p>ISKCON stresses in its 'Seven Purposes' as well as in the Statement 

              'the aim to co-operate to the benefit of society at large'. This 

              aim can only be welcomed. Yet there are quite a few steps to be 

              taken towards that purpose. The compatibility of social visions 

              needs to be clarified, the degree to which ISKCON is prepared to 

              leave behind Indian social concepts such as <i>varnasrama</i> ideas 

              of a stratified society will have to be the subject of dialogue. 

              Christian ethics basically accept the equal rights of all human 

              beings and the right to self-determination that are laid down in 

              the German constitution. Dialogue with ISKCON in the context of 

              a Western society will ask for an affirmation of these values (as 

              a matter of fact, the Indian constitution offers basically the same 

              ethical standards as Western nations do!).</p>

            <p>In the encounter, it will always be a moving element to question 

              each other as to how far transparency, democratic structures, the 

              individual freedom of every single devotee, the right to come and 

              leave again etc. are respected. This is a vice-versa demand, a challenge 

              to the Christian partner as well.</p>

            <p>It is part of every religious identity to affirm its respective 

              faith and creed, often to the extent of claiming absoluteness (not 

              to be confused with monopoly). In encounters we will be challenged 

              to recognise our respective absoluteness claims. Some may consider 

              this a contradiction in itself. It is not. It is the way, perhaps 

              the only reasonable way, religious people meet. In Saunaka Rsi's 

              paper I see a step towards acceptance of this way.</p>

            <p>The encounter shall be open for many clarifications. Still there 

              are sceptical voices claiming that ISKCON, like the famous Janus, 

              has two faces - the smiling face in dialogues with their external 

              partners, and the strange, repressive face towards its own members 

              - preaching wine to the dialoguing world and water to their devotees.</p>

            <p>Those who support a constructive encounter with ISKCON - I am one 

              of them - are longing for an honest dialogue and honest partners. 

              The paper in question gives me hope that this is what ISKCON wants 

              too.</p>
