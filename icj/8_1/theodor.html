            <p><i>In this paper Ithamar Theodor proposes a model based on Bhagavad-gita 

              and aimed at developing a philosophical basis for social development 

              in ISKCON. Referring to previous studies of ISKCON, he argues that 

              devotees' self-understanding is often not consistent with the values 

              and principles of Vaisnava culture. In this paper he points out 

              that a moral-religious foundation is the default position for a 

              sustainable spiritual life for the individual and the community. 

              </i></p>

            <p>It is sometimes said that Srila Prabhupada built a house in which 

              the whole world can live. Inspired by this idea, I would like to 

              suggest a three-storey house model as a reflection of the nature 

              of ISKCON. The idea is grounded in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and 

              is designed to offer a supporting framework for the <i>sankirtana</i> 

              movement, as well as to further the ongoing discussions of implementing 

              <i>varnasrama</i> within ISKCON. The house described here has three 

              storeys, each having fundamental distinctions that can best be demonstrated 

              by the differences in ontology and ethics characterising each level. 

              The idea presented here favours an individual-centred, as opposed 

              to an organisation-centred, paradigm. Before addressing the issue, 

              let us acknowledge the two-dimensional realm in which ISKCON exists. 

              Ravindra Svarupa Dasa writes:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>... one needs to become acquainted with two contrasting 

              social ideals, or models, transmitted to us by Srila Prabhupada. 

              The first is that of a society of Vaisnavas, of transcendental, 

              liberated devotees who conduct themselves spontaneously in accord 

              with the principles called <i>sanatana-dharma</i>. The second is 

              that of a society of materially conditioned human beings who strictly 

              conduct themselves in obedience to the injunctions of the Vedas 

              under the system called <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>. (Ravindra Svarupa 

              Dasa, pp. 35-6)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>This presentation lays a firm foundation for distinguishing the 

              conditioned human realm from the higher spiritual realm and their 

              corresponding ethical systems. In describing the three-storey house, 

              the first floor corresponds to the human level, and the second and 

              third floors correspond to the transcendental level.</p>

            <p><b>First floor: Living in the world</b></p>

            <p>The first floor is worldly, representing proper human life governed 

              by <i>dharma</i>. Within this world, the human being lives a healthy 

              life characterised by morality, law and justice, personal and social 

              order, religion, adherence to duty, etiquette and social stability. 

              The basic social structure derived from <i>dharma </i>is <i>varnasrama</i>, 

              which is inherent in every individual's nature or state of existence 

              within the three <i>gunas</i>. It stabilises one's personality and 

              character by providing a supporting framework of duties. Thus, the 

              individual is designated according to two basic parameters: his 

              or her attitude towards renunciation, and his or her professional 

              ability, with every <i>varna</i> and <i>asrama </i>having its own 

              etiquette. </p>

            <p>Many individuals living on this floor have a positive view of the 

              world. It is seen as a place where a <i>varnasrama </i>society can 

              and should prosper, its members living moral, productive and happy 

              lives. Such a society is naturally inclined to protect its weaker 

              members, including animals, and foster as well as educate its future 

              generation, encouraging the development of various branches of knowledge, 

              such as architecture, medicine and the arts. </p>

            <p><b>Second floor: The struggle to get free from the world</b></p>

            <p>This floor is fundamentally different from the first floor, and 

              its residents are those who are struggling to free themselves from 

              the cycle of birth and death. The world is no longer viewed as positive, 

              but as a place of misery, wherein repeated birth and death take 

              place. Thus the residents concentrate on two main goals: developing 

              detachment from the world, and establishing a hold in the spiritual 

              realm.</p>

            <p>These residents are not obliged to follow <i>dharma</i>, as they 

              have no interest in establishing proper worldly life, although they 

              sometimes do follow the injunctions of <i>dharma</i> as an example 

              to the first-floor residents. Their goal is higher, and the branches 

              of knowledge cultivated by them are such that they see themselves 

              as spirit souls rather than human beings bound by the three modes 

              of nature. Their ethics are different from those of the first- floor 

              residents.</p>

            <p>Rather than trying to achieve prosperity in the world, they cultivate 

              indifference towards success and failure. Instead of attempting 

              to protect their society, they aspire to develop indifference to 

              their enemies and their friends. They do not attempt to situate 

              the mind in the mode of goodness, through art, beauty and culture, 

              but seek to detach it from everything material and fix it on the 

              spiritual realm. They perceive the world as dualistic and comprised 

              of two elements that can never blend: matter and spirit. Their aim 

              is to free themselves from matter and reach a plane of pure spiritual 

              existence. They are absorbed in different forms of yoga that have 

              a common aim: to detach the practitioner from the material and connect 

              him to the spiritual.</p>

            <p><b>Third floor: Full spiritual realisation</b></p>

            <p>Here reside those whose struggle is over. They are completely established 

              in the spiritual realm. The material world holds no attraction for 

              them. The nature of their existence is of full spiritual consciousness, 

              spiritual existence and spiritual bliss. Their absorption in love 

              of God is so deep that they see no difference between residing in 

              this world or in the spiritual realm. The pure emotional waves, 

              or <i>rasas,</i> experienced by them have no comparison in the material 

              world. From their point of view, only Lord Krsna, His expansions, 

              His devotees and His service exist. The whole question of matter 

              and spirit, worldly culture and renunciation, seems irrelevant to 

              them. Material knowledge, such as that found in sophisticated cultural 

              pursuits or high philosophy, may be perceived by them as an obstruction 

              to their absorption in ecstasy, and may thus be rejected.</p>

            <p><b>The staircase</b></p>

            <p>So the question now is where do we go from here? We have found 

              three groups of people living in completely different realms, so 

              much so that there may be no common language with which they can 

              communicate, and no common grounds on which they can agree. </p>

            <p>Fortunately, this house has a staircase or a ladder connecting 

              the first floor to the second, and the second floor to the third. 

              This idea is best presented by Bhurijana Dasa as the 'yoga ladder'. 

              (Bhurijana Dasa, pp. 59-68) These steps are an intrinsic part of 

              the house, and they encourage all residents to continuously progress 

              upwards towards the third floor. The stage on which one is situated 

              is determined by the motive underlying his or her actions. For example, 

              one motivated by the fruits of action can aspire to work without 

              attachment for these fruits, or learn to offer them to Krsna. Likewise, 

              one who performs his devotional service while maintaining a strong 

              bodily identification through the performance of <i>karma-yoga</i>, 

              may gradually elevate himself to a more spontaneous platform where 

              he does not need to rely so much on a bodily designation to perform 

              his service. In any case, the principle of constant progress underlies 

              the whole system and may be its most important factor.</p>

            <p>As soon as a sincere person is properly situated on a particular 

              stage or floor and follows the proper etiquette, rules and regulations 

              for that stage, he will feel happy in his progress and will strengthen 

              and encourage the other residents, no matter where they are situated. 

              Thus a sincere first-floor, or <i>kanistha</i>, resident would happily 

              associate with a sincere second-floor, or <i>madhyama</i>, renunciate, 

              their common ground being that they both accept the house, its rules 

              and goals, and are trying to make progress from their present position 

              to become third-floor <i>uttama-adhikaris</i>. </p>

            <p>The common principle, therefore, is to be properly situated somewhere 

              in the house, to thrive there and endeavour to make constant internal 

              progress towards a higher stage. As soon as these conditions are 

              established, the house could support unlimited residents, all living 

              in harmony with each other. A member of ISKCON could thus be designated 

              a resident of that house, irrespective of whether he lived within 

              or outside the temple, whether he is an advanced devotee or a neophyte. 

              The only qualifications for residence are his acceptance of the 

              ethical obligations and duties appropriate to his position and a 

              sincere endeavour to make progress.</p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada, who was situated on the highest level of love 

              of God, or the third floor, raised, by his personal association, 

              all those who came into contact with him. Indeed, ISKCON was established 

              on the second and third floors. In other words, devotees could experience 

              the deep renunciation and transcendental emotions of love of God 

              during Prabhupada's presence, and also after his departure. </p>

            <p>Endeavouring to implement Krsna consciousness in the Western world, 

              Srila Prabhupada began by establishing the third floor, i.e. chanting 

              of the Hare Krsna <i>maha-mantra</i>, and later introduced the second 

              floor, through preaching that the material world is a miserable 

              place which is to be renounced. Although his books contain ample 

              instructions on laying the foundations of the first floor, it seems 

              this part of his mission remained unfulfilled. (See Ravindra Svarupa 

              Dasa, 1999)</p>

            <p>After Prabhupada's departure, ISKCON perceived itself as a society 

              of second- and third-floor residents, considering the first floor 

              a compromise for those souls who were unable to be fully Krsna conscious. 

              These individuals were considered second-class devotees, known by 

              various titles such as 'Friends of Krsna' or 'congregation members'. 

              The common view of a second- and third-floor devotee was someone 

              who was living within a temple, chanting sixteen rounds, following 

              the four regulative principles, and who was situated on the transcendental 

              plane, beyond the three modes of nature. With such prevailing ideas 

              it was no surprise that organised missionary activities were at 

              their peak, whereas community projects such as education, culture, 

              social development and professional devotee businesses (as opposed 

              to unprofessional missionary activities designed to raise funds) 

              were neglected. ISKCON continued to function with these assumptions 

              long after Prabhupada's disappearance, and although there have been 

              significant accomplishments in many areas, there is a growing feeling 

              of dissatisfaction among many members due to shortcomings in social 

              and educational development; or, according to our model, due to 

              the first floor not being properly or sufficiently maintained. Thus 

              writes Dr E. Burke Rochford:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>There is a striking lack of trust between ISKCON members 

              and the movement's leadership, as well as between devotees themselves. 

              ... there is a lack of honest and open communication between devotees. 

              ... ISKCON has generally failed to integrate families and family 

              life into its communities. Until recent discussions of 'social development', 

              ISKCON has done little towards building an internal domestic culture 

              capable of supporting householders and their children. ... A lack 

              of employment opportunities within ISKCON ... . Inadequate educational 

              alternatives within ISKCON ... . (Rochford, p. 17)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>I would thus suggest that ISKCON urgently needs to heal itself 

              and to firmly establish its first floor, thus allowing each and 

              every member to make the best use of his energy and qualifications.</p>

            <p>How can this structure be practically applied? Should we gather 

              all ISKCON members and divide the assembly into three groups, saying: 

              'All those who belong to the first floor, please assemble over here.' 

              This is obviously not desirable, helpful or possible, as the constant 

              interaction between the three groups is beneficial for all. Moreover, 

              the personality of most devotees may reflect all three floors to 

              various degrees. For example, a person may take care of his health 

              (first floor), contemplate how he is not the body (second floor) 

              and on visiting the Deities, may experience ecstasy and love of 

              God (third floor). It is not the members that should be separated 

              from each other, but the floors.</p>

            <p>Each floor has its own distinct ethos, finding its expression in 

              different ideas, modes of behaviour, underlying assumptions, language, 

              and so on. In other words, this three-storey model is a theoretical 

              structure, similar to a grammatical paradigm presenting fictional 

              forms such as roots and stems, which although not applied in the 

              daily usage of a language, serve as its foundation. </p>

            <p>It is my conviction that the obscure blending of these floors is 

              preventing ISKCON from realising its true potential, and that by 

              mentally organising and separating the floors, ISKCON as a society 

              would make greater progress towards fulfilling the role designed 

              for it by Srila Prabhupada, which is to become a 'cultural movement 

              for the benefit of all'. (Prabhupada, p. 24) </p>

            <p>I have a practical example of a person who has developed all three 

              floors in his life; a devotee friend who exemplifies a perfect balance 

              of all three storeys. His <i>asrama</i> is organised and clear; 

              he is steadily married and living happily with his wife and children. 

              His <i>varna </i>is well-organised; he is a professional, greatly 

              respected at the firm where he works, and receives adequate remuneration. 

              Being inspired in his Krsna consciousness, he manages a flourishing 

              temple with high standards of Deity worship, and ample preaching 

              programmes. His <i>sannyasi </i>guru is very pleased with him and 

              relies on his considerable efforts. Being fully engaged, he is already 

              contemplating the next <i>asrama</i>, hoping, in due course, to 

              delegate his temple responsibilities and devote time to travelling 

              and preaching. Belonging to all three floors, he understands the 

              difference between them and is thus able to constantly move between 

              them. </p>

            <p><b>The organisation and the individual</b></p>

            <p>Let us examine the issue in terms of the organisation (ISKCON) 

              and the individual. ISKCON was established by Srila Prabhupada as 

              an army of preachers whose main objective was to spread Krsna consciousness 

              and fight <i>maya </i>(illusion). The heart of that concept is undoubtedly 

              the spreading of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's <i>sankirtana </i>movement, 

              which required considerable organisation. The mission was inherited 

              by Srila Prabhupada, who delegated the responsibility to ISKCON's 

              Governing Body Commission (GBC), who in turn passed it down to the 

              temple presidents, and so on. Krsna Dharma Dasa writes: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Srila Prabhupada also gave some directions as to how the 

              GBC should function. 'To map out a global preaching strategy for 

              the worldwide society, while leaving details of local preaching 

              to the local management'. (Krsna Dharma Dasa, p. 71)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Within that structure, as in the regular army, everyone's attention 

              is directed upward to the generals, waiting for them to define the 

              tasks. Once this has been done, responsibility is delegated to a 

              lower executive level to devise a plan and perform the task. This 

              was certainly the best paradigm for establishing a new movement, 

              engaging divisions of young and inspired men and women, and may 

              remain so for many highly motivated devotees. However, it tends 

              to sacrifice individual needs to the higher cause, justifying the 

              sacrifice of the individual as the price of participating in the 

              sacred mission. Thus, 'Preaching is the essence, books are the basis, 

              purity is the force and utility is the principle.' No doubt, this 

              idea is firmly grounded in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, where Krsna 

              says, 'For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, 

              pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come 

              back to Me.' (<i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 18.68) However, the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              is also unique in its emphasis on individual development and, in 

              fact, the whole <i>Gita</i> is spoken for Arjuna's benefit, showing 

              him how, from every point of view, serving Krsna (through fighting 

              the war) is in his own best interests. </p>

            <p>The three-storey house is 'individual-centred', in that its point 

              of departure is not the greater mission but the individual. In other 

              words, for someone to define himself in that paradigm, he would 

              have to start by examining, deeply and honestly, his own nature 

              and his own state of spiritual advancement. Having done so, he could 

              find his best situation or position in the model, stick to the rules 

              of that position and make gradual progress at his own pace. For 

              example, if a person defines himself as a <i>grhastha</i>, he would 

              follow the principle of taking care of his wife and children. It 

              appears then, that the definition of <i>asrama </i>is quite clear. 

              However, the question of <i>varna</i> needs further clarification, 

              as Urmila Dasi explains:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>If we understand personality through the models presented 

              in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, the corresponding vocational direction 

              becomes easier, as in that model personal qualities and work are 

              closely entwined. In loose terms, those with brahminical qualities 

              work as priests, in the teaching professions and as government advisors. 

              <i>Ksatriyas </i>work in government administration and serve in 

              the military. <i>Vaisyas </i>have work related to farming, business 

              and trade. And <i>sudras</i> work in manual labour, entertainment, 

              crafts and as general assistants to the other three types in society. 

              (Urmila Dasi, p. 24)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>It seems that one can define his nature, more or less, in terms 

              of <i>varna</i>, and then project this according to present time 

              and circumstance. In other words, if one is inclined towards business, 

              he or she could be defined as having a <i>vaisya</i> nature, even 

              though they would not necessarily exemplify the traditional <i>vaisya</i> 

              characteristics, such as farming. Similarly, if one is inclined 

              towards studying and teaching, he or she could be considered as 

              having a brahminical nature, even though they may find themselves 

              in a Western university and not in a hut on the banks of the Sarasvati 

              River. Having said that, it follows that a different ethical code 

              would be appropriate for each <i>varna</i>. For example, <i>brahmanas 

              </i>should be austere, honest and learned, whereas <i>ksatriyas 

              </i>should be courageous and generous.</p>

            <p>The discussion of <i>varnasrama </i>has been taking place in ISKCON 

              for many years now. A major objection to implementing this system 

              is that 'ISKCON is meant for more than good marriages.' The argument 

              is that ISKCON is a great spiritual movement, whose aim is to liberate 

              its members from the world of <i>samsara</i>, not to arrange a comfortable 

              material situation for them. However, the three-storey house paradigm 

              uses <i>varnasrama </i>as a point of departure for spiritual life 

              and as a supporting framework for the <i>sankirtana </i>mission, 

              as opposed to perverted <i>varnasrama </i>forms, which promote different 

              types of caste consciousness while ignoring the true spiritual goal. 

            </p>

            <p>The basic assumption of the three-storey-house model is that when 

              one's psycho-physical nature is properly regarded, then one's energy 

              for material and spiritual life is revived. A well-organised first 

              floor creates the right atmosphere for developing the second and 

              third floors. Conversely, a poorly developed first floor is a fertile 

              ground for social unrest and even <i>vaisnava-aparadha</i>.</p>

            <p>Where does the GBC fit into this framework? Are we proposing a 

              'do-it-yourself' system, where each individual can ascertain his 

              own situation? To a small extent, yes, but in a way that will bring 

              the members together willingly, as opposed to being forcibly controlled.</p>

            <p>What is gained by applying such a structure? The graduates of a 

              healthy first floor become steady residents of the second, who are 

              then gradually established on the third. The first floor connects 

              and holds society to the ground, providing the residents of the 

              higher floors a medium through which to face the world. To paraphrase 

              a common example used by Srila Prabhupada, although in a different 

              connotation: We have to water the root, without which the whole 

              tree will wither. The residents of the first floor need the residents 

              of the higher floors, and vice versa, as the complete structure 

              is a single holistic unit.</p>

            <p>Although all three floors are important, it seems that at this 

              point there need to be special efforts aimed at establishing the 

              first floor, something that has not been sufficiently developed 

              so far. I would urge the Society to undertake this mission for the 

              benefit of all.</p>
