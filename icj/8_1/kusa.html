            <p>These past few days I have relished participating in the application 

              of <i>vaisnava-siddhanta</i> to management. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Burke Rochford's report, submitted to the GBC last year, states: 

              'I recommend that ISKCON leaders immediately move to restore the 

              rights and responsibilities afforded women by Srila Prabhupada. 

              Men should be educated accordingly. Guru and non-guru leaders should 

              teach respect for women; women should again be viewed as capable 

              devotees in the service of Prabhupada's movement rather than as 

              temptresses or other such derogatory characterisations. To do so 

              would immediately increase the self-esteem of women and make them 

              more productive members of ISKCON. This will also make the movement 

              more attractive to potential members who view ISKCON's position 

              on women as antiquated and morally objectionable.'</p>

            <p>Calling women temptresses and using other such derogatory characterisations 

              is, in part, due to our failure to practise austerity of speech. 

              In <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>17.15, Lord Krsna states: 'Austerity of 

              speech consists in speaking words that are truthful, pleasing, beneficial 

              and not agitating to others, and also in regularly reciting Vedic 

              literature.' Profound speech invigorates receptivity and trust within 

              our Gaudiya Vaisnava family. So, why do we sometimes utilise denigrating 

              speech in relation to women? Perhaps it is because when a man is 

              improperly trained, rather than taking responsibility for his own 

              sex desire, he blames women and thus speaks harshly about them and 

              to them. This harshness towards women, and along with it, harshness 

              towards the householder <i>asrama</i>, intimidates, alienates and 

              lessens the esteem and dignity of women and <i>grhasthas</i>. Gender-biased 

              speech wounds our Society; spoken from the <i>vyasasana</i>, it 

              strikes a thorn in our hearts.</p>

            <p>The <i>Bhagavatam's</i> wisdom is not gender-exclusive. A small 

              adjustment in the speaker's elaboration of a s<i>loka </i>could 

              make the instruction applicable to the whole audience. For example, 

              if the text<i> </i>reads, 'regarding associating with women for 

              illicit sex', the speaker could purport that one should guard against 

              associating with anyone for illicit sex. While reflecting guru, 

              <i>sadhu </i>and <i>sastra </i>it behooves us to consider our audience 

              and practise austerity of speech.</p>

            <p>Pleasing and beneficial speech comes naturally with proper training. 

              A <i>brahmacari</i> who has been properly trained honours rather 

              than denigrates women. When such a <i>brahmacari</i> enters the 

              <i>grhastha-asrama</i>, his dominating male ego is tempered by his 

              wife's precious qualities. His realisations and humility increase 

              during his decades as a householder, while his sensuality decreases 

              until it becomes nil and he enters the <i>vanaprastha</i> stage.</p>

            <p>Finally, having fully developed his own inner, gentle life - of 

              forgiveness, softness, nurturing and relatedness - the satisfied 

              gentleman accepts the renounced order. Such a secure renunciate 

              is not threatened by a woman's power; on the contrary, he evokes 

              it.</p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada set the example of this mature stage of <i>sannyasa</i>. 

              He was as hard as a thunderbolt, kicking with boots on the heads 

              of materialistic scientists, Mayavadis, pseudo-religionists and 

              <i>sahajiyas</i> when time, place and circumstance warranted it. 

              He was also as soft as a rose, having nurturing, loving exchanges 

              with his followers - women, children and men.</p>

            <p>Overemphasis on qualities such as rational analysis, authority, 

              control, competition and power causes us, men and women, to demean 

              softness, simplicity and gentility. By neglecting and denying these 

              kind and humbling aspects in each of us, by making the feminine 

              seem trivial, our lives become progressively more sterile, inert 

              and empty. The feminine qualities of nurturing and compassion perish 

              when pitted against the masculine lust for power. Our most noble 

              spiritual path, when denied feminine values, degenerates to prideful 

              hypocrisy rather than devotion.</p>

            <p>It is time to bravely and without sensuality affirm the feminine, 

              to heal the wounds and at the same time contribute to the healing 

              of our children and our Society. Let us move from a place of arrogant 

              weakness to one of humble strength.</p>

            <p>In his purport to text 1.9.27 of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, Srila 

              Prabhupada writes: 'As far as the women class are concerned, they 

              are accepted as a power of inspiration for men. As such, women are 

              more powerful than men.'</p>

            <p>Due to Devahuti's feminine power, Kardama Muni was inspired to 

              create an incredibly magnificent palace in the sky; due to Gandhari's 

              feminine power, her eldest son, Duryodhana, received a body that 

              was impervious to weapons. Due to Savitri's feminine power, her 

              husband Satyavan was rescued from death. Due to Cintamani's inspiration, 

              Bilvamangala Thakura gave up material life and completely devoted 

              himself to Krsna.</p>

            <p>Honour all Vaisnavas. Failing to do so inspires edicts instead 

              of dialogues, resolutions instead of relationships, indifference 

              instead of spiritual intimacy. Vaisnavis are agents of Laksmi, not 

              Mayadevi. They summon the presence of Narayana, for Laksmi is always 

              in her Lord's company.</p>

            <p>We may also note with caution that Krsna conscious feminine power 

              can create havoc in the lives of those who don't respect Vaisnavis: 

              the unscrupulous Kauravas perished due to dishonouring Draupadi. 

              If those of us who are not on the level of Draupadi are disrespected, 

              we may live down to those expectations and become representatives 

              of Mayadevi. Respecting a woman as an agent of Laksmi will do much 

              to encourage her most precious devotion to the Lord. Expectation, 

              especially from those we respect, has an extraordinary influence 

              on us.</p>

            <p>We have experienced Sri Caitanya's, Srila Bhaktivinoda's, Srila 

              Bhaktisiddhanta's and Srila Prabhupada's mercy. We now request the 

              mercy of the assembled Vaisnavas. Our ISKCON social body needs a 

              change of heart!</p>
