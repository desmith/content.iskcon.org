            <p>The ISKCON Communications Europe Leadership Team (ICELT), headed 

              by Saunaka Rsi Dasa, held its annual meeting in the scenic surroundings 

              of Hill End Residential &amp; Field Study Centre, near Oxford, from 

              19-23 April. Attending were devotees from several European countries; 

              Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, the present Chairman of the GBC; and Anuttama 

              Dasa, the GBC for Communications. </p>

            <p>The meeting began with reports on the activities undertaken by 

              ISKCON Communications (IC) in Europe and what are seen as the main 

              challenges. In most countries, these difficulties do not come from 

              outside ISKCON - where important and valuable interfaith and academic 

              relationships have been forged - but from within the Society itself. 

              Several reports emphasised a lack of trust, vision and unity amongst 

              devotees, with concern and disappointment being voiced about ISKCON's 

              leadership and organisation, all of which could be contributing 

              factors to devotees' present lack of commitment to the movement 

              and its principles. The presence of this year's GBC Chairman, Ravindra 

              Svarupa Dasa, at the meetings was therefore seen as very important.</p>

            <p>Lyall Ward described his work on the production of the <i>ISKCON 

              Communications Journal</i> (ICJ) as well as his extensive work setting 

              up ISKCON's official website (to be found at www.iskcon.com), an 

              excellent resource for devotees, academics, governments, students, 

              etc. </p>

            <p>Anuttama Dasa related the positive interreligious and academic 

              relationships developing in the USA, and also gave his analysis 

              of what he sees as ISKCON's present challenges, reiterating the 

              seeming lack of vision and identity. In his eyes the Society appears 

              to be stuck in the old paradigms of the 1960s and 1970s, not realising 

              that the world has changed, and therefore has difficulty in being 

              relevant in people's lives. It doesn't value the <i>grhastha-asrama</i> 

              and still bases its economy on one-time contacts rather than creating 

              a climate where committed, cared-for members support the movement. 

            </p>

            <p>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa talked about his vision for the GBC and what 

              he would try to do this year to foster a positive change. He was 

              inspired by the idea of creating an environment where GBC members 

              would get spiritual inspiration in their work. One suggestion he 

              made was the introduction of retreat days between the GBC meetings, 

              allowing reflection on deeper issues. He believed a climate of Pentecostal 

              revelation was needed as well as strengthening the parliamentary 

              procedure favoured by Srila Prabhupada. He also thought that education 

              and regular retreats for ISKCON gurus would be helpful. His talk 

              provoked a long and stimulating question and answer session, many 

              of the questions revolving around the GBC's failure to listen to 

              their constituents. </p>

            <p>On the second day, Saunaka Rsi Dasa described the development and 

              future vision of the Oxford Centre for Vaisnava and Hindu Studies 

              (OCVHS), an independent academic institution focusing on the study 

              of Hindu and Vaisnava culture. Of the four students presently studying 

              at the Centre, three are working towards a Ph.D., and all are full 

              members of Oxford University. Prof. Joseph O'Connell, from the University 

              of Toronto, is the Centre's acting Dean of Studies for the present 

              term.</p>

            <p>After a brief tour of Oxford, we visited the New Bodleian Library, 

              where Dr Gillian Evison, Head of the Indian Institute Library, kindly 

              gave a tour of its vast wealth of Indian literature. The library 

              has the largest Sanskrit collection outside of India, and it is 

              planned that in the future the OCVHS library will be affiliated 

              with it.</p>

            <p>In the afternoon Richard Gombrich, Boden Professor of Sanskrit 

              at Oxford University, delivered a speech on the importance and challenges 

              of Sanskrit studies. He expressed concern at present developments, 

              where the government is interested in funding more profitable skills 

              such as computer engineering, leaving those engaged in purely academic 

              studies having to spend a considerable amount of time in raising 

              funds from the private sector.</p>

            <p>Days three and four were facilitated by Anuradha Dasi, who assisted 

              in the in-depth exploration of some important subject matters. Day 

              three - entitled 'ISKCON: I Love You, I Hate You' - looked at the 

              IC members' own relationship with ISKCON and how the Society embodies 

              its seven purposes. The session began with a quote from Carlo Carretto, 

              rewritten for ISKCON:</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote><i>How much I must criticise you, my ISKCON, and yet how 

              much I love you!<br>

              You have made me suffer more than anyone and yet I owe more to you 

              than to anyone.<br>

              I should like to see you destroyed and yet I need your presence.<br>

              You have given me much scandal and yet you alone have made me understand 

              holiness.<br>

              Never in this world have I seen anything more compromised, more 

              false, <br>

              yet never have I touched anything more pure, more generous, or more 

              beautiful.<br>

              Countless times I have felt like slamming the door of my soul in 

              your face, <br>

              and yet, every night I have prayed that I might die in your sure 

              arms!<br>

              No, I cannot be free of you, for I am one with you, even if not 

              completely you.<br>

              Then to where would I go? To build another ISKCON?<br>

              But I could not build one without the same defects, for they are 

              my defects. <br>

              And again, if I were to build another ISKCON, it would be my ISKCON, 

              <br>

              not Prabhupada's ISKCON. No, I am old enough. I know better.</i></blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>After exploring the topic, each person gave their personal definition 

              of how they saw today's ISKCON. Responses such as: 'I have no idea 

              of what ISKCON is'; 'one society within the Hare Krsna movement'; 

              'a blobby, invertebrate creature looking for a skeleton'; 'a mess, 

              a miracle, a miraculous mess', raised the thought that this may 

              indicate an identity crisis within the movement. The question was 

              also asked as to whether ISKCON is just an organisation of which 

              those present are members or is it purely a product of its membership? 

              Should the organisation be held responsible for an individual's 

              mistake, or should the individual alone be held culpable? Although 

              the individual must take responsibility for his/her actions, we 

              can see from the history of ISKCON that the same mistakes have been 

              made, repeatedly, by the organisation itself. It was therefore felt 

              that there exists a specific culture spread throughout the organisation, 

              perhaps by its leaders, that facilitates the recurrence of the same 

              mistakes. This could indicate that, to a certain extent, an organisation 

              must accept responsibility for failure to properly educate members.</p>

            <p>It was also agreed that ISKCON had changed since Srila Prabhupada's 

              departure, both in positive and negative ways. The question arose 

              whether the organisation itself was leading that change or had it 

              merely been influenced by the passage of time. If the Society was 

              not at the forefront of proactive change, then why not? This was 

              perhaps the most controversial, yet stimulating, part of the discussion. 

              In trying to preserve Srila Prabhupada's legacy, while at the same 

              time expanding his movement, ISKCON appears to be stuck in certain 

              patterns that don't foster creativity. One could say, therefore, 

              that while there is a drive for change, there is also a leaning 

              towards preservation. Although there is no need for these two forces 

              to conflict, they sometimes do when there is a lack of clarity, 

              and the organisation is left paralysed.</p>

            <p>The discussion then moved on to whether it was right to change 

              things originally set up by Srila Prabhupada. It was agreed that 

              there were several things that could (or even should) change. Most 

              of them had to do with organisational matters concerned with the 

              Society's need to readjust to reflect the changes in today's world. 

              However, there were other things that couldn't be changed, such 

              as the basic principles upholding ISKCON's tradition, keeping it 

              in line with its original seven purposes. Although no consensus 

              was reached on this matter, since the vast and difficult subject 

              matter obviously needs further exploration, valuable contributions 

              were received from Tamala Krsna Goswami, Krsna Ksetra Dasa and Krpamaya 

              Dasa, all of whom joined the group for this one day.</p>

            <p>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa started the sessions on day four with a talk 

              on his experiences of academic study, and the challenges that faced 

              devotees who were pursuing this path. He commented that, at a certain 

              point, there arose a need to confront one's beliefs with the 'scientific' 

              Western empirical worldview, but said devotees should understand 

              that faith in authority is also an intrinsic part of academia. Therefore, 

              any worldview accepted is based upon faith; an opinion reflected 

              by Anselm, a follower of St Augustin, who stated that all forms 

              of knowledge begin with an act of faith. Ravindra Svarupa also felt 

              that ISKCON could learn some useful skills from academia such as 

              critical self-awareness and thoroughness in pursuing arguments.</p>

            <p>After discussing the problems with ISKCON and what we might like 

              to change in the organisation, the attendees then looked inside 

              their own hearts. It was understood that any external reform has 

              to start from within the individual. Inspiration was found in a 

              poem by T. S. Eliot: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote><i>They constantly try to escape<br>

              from the darkness within and without<br>

              By dreaming of systems so perfect<br>

              that no one will need to be good<br>

              But the man that is will shadow<br>

              the man that pretends to be</i></blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Each of those present envisioned how they would like to be seen 

              by themselves and others, considered the sometimes painful reality 

              and the challenges to be faced in achieving the desired goals. Each 

              person wrote a letter to Krsna expressing their struggles and hopes, 

              and also penned an answer from Krsna to themselves. It was a very 

              interesting and touching experience, especially when the letters 

              were shared within the group. We were looking at what could be done 

              to bring about a positive change in our lives so that we can move 

              forward.</p>

            <p>During the last part of day four, the group perceived a need to 

              make a thorough analysis and evaluation of the Society, especially 

              the performance of the GBC. It was felt that without such analysis 

              it would be very difficult to plan a strategy. On this point, some 

              members of the group expressed surprise that a previous and thorough 

              attempt at analysing and evaluating ISKCON, Burke Rochford's 'Prabhupada 

              Centennial Survey', hadn't been taken very seriously by ISKCON's 

              leadership. It was hoped that they would take a closer look.</p>

            <p>On the final day Saunaka Rsi Dasa summarised the discussions that 

              had taken place and emphasised the importance of these meetings, 

              saying that this year's had been particularly special since it was 

              the first time that a GBC chairman had so openly and frankly discussed 

              the problems of ISKCON to its ordinary members. Indeed, all those 

              present had expressed pleasure at Ravindra Svarupa's openness and 

              receptiveness to their feedback. </p>

            <p>Saunaka Rsi also highlighted that the ICELT team was responsible 

              for initiating many valuable projects such as the Radhadesh seminars, 

              Vaisnava Training and Education (VTE), the Oxford Centre for Vaishnava 

              and Hindu Studies, the Child Protection Team and the <i>ISKCON Communications 

              Journal</i>. The ICELT also introduced the philosophy and culture 

              of education in ISKCON in Europe; initiated a frank, yet conservative, 

              process of analysis of ISKCON and its problems; developed an international 

              strategy for interfaith dialogue and dialogue with anti-cult organisations; 

              and directed various national missionary campaigns in Europe. </p>

            <p>The focus for the next year is to consolidate and strengthen these 

              areas. Nevertheless, one particular area to concentrate on will 

              be to formulate a statement of identity for ISKCON (what it is, 

              what it does, where it is going and its membership criteria), put 

              together a moral code for the Society and produce pamphlets on different 

              issues for internal and external communications.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, it was felt that as long as there was a forum for 

              such open and sincere discussion, there is a hope for ISKCON. Such 

              discussions can eventually lead to a positive and visible change 

              within the Society.</p>
