            <p><i>In April this year, at an ISKCON Communications meeting in Oxford, 

              England, Ravindra Svarupa Dasa presented his personal vision of 

              how GBC authority could be restored. This was a landmark event in 

              the history of GBC communications. It is the first time that a GBC 

              chairman presented his views and plans to a forum of general ISKCON 

              members while leaving the floor open for frank discussion. The model 

              proposed for ISKCON's development assumes that integrity and accountability 

              will form the real basis of authority in the movement and should 

              become the foundation of all levels of ISKCON leadership.</i></p>

            <p>I have heard many people say they feel there is no leadership, 

              vision or guidance in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. 

              What I took to be my mission, at first with regard to the Governing 

              Body Commission (GBC) and then the rest of ISKCON, was the restoration 

              of authority. By authority I mean spiritual authority, moral authority, 

              managerial authority, even legal authority. In all of these areas 

              there is a lack of confidence and trust.</p>

            <p>Although I say my goal is to restore the authority of the GBC, 

              in one sense perhaps it never really had that authority to begin 

              with. Until the mid-1980s, the ability of ISKCON's leaders to control 

              people within the Society was partly based on the fact that devotees 

              were financially dependent. When you want to exercise control over 

              financially independent people, those people have to willingly surrender; 

              it is their own choice. It is true that if you live in a temple, 

              you have some freedom to leave, but it can be difficult. So I think 

              this could be a new understanding for the GBC - that it is not a 

              question of power, but rather of the exercise of real authority. 

            </p>

            <p>I am very much dedicated to the principle of the GBC; its establishment 

              and the implementation of the principle behind it was a major achievement 

              of Prabhupada's. In my opinion, the GBC is a good model of leadership. 

              In its formation, Prabhupada took some ideas from Western corporate 

              structure, the GBC being the name of the Board of Directors of the 

              Indian Railroad, a British corporate institution. But Prabhupada 

              also talks of how the idea of co-operation, cohesiveness and working 

              together is fundamental to the notion of <i>sankirtana</i>; this 

              idea of basing leadership on the notion of <i>sankirtana </i>is 

              in contrast with the older, more traditional, hierarchical Indian 

              model of a single, self-effulgent <i>acarya</i> who heads an institution. 

              This <i>sankirtana </i>style of leadership and management is what 

              Prabhupada wanted. </p>

            <p>I think that you can become Krsna conscious and go back to Godhead 

              in institutions that do not follow this <i>sankirtana </i>model. 

              There are devotees outside of ISKCON -Vaisnavas in the Gaudiya Matha 

              for example - who have not been able to follow this model of co-operation 

              and cohesiveness. It is not a question of whether these people are 

              going back to Godhead; the question is, what do we have to do to 

              propagate Lord Caitanya's movement? That is the mission that we 

              owe to Srila Prabhupada. </p>

            <p>I have heard lectures in which Prabhupada says, 'Here is the proof 

              that you love Krsna - if you do, then you'll follow His order.' 

              This is not sentimental; it is the test of love. Prabhupada said 

              the same thing regarding ISKCON: 'Your love for me will be shown 

              by how much you co-operate to keep this institution together after 

              I am gone.' This is a quotation from the <i>Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta,</i> 

              and it is often quoted.</p>

            <p> In Tamala Krsna Goswami's diary entry of 23 May 1977, this statement 

              is recorded in a slightly different form: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Srila Prabhupada emphasised, 'Your love for me will be 

              tested how after my departure you maintain this institution. We 

              have glamour, and people are feeling our weight. This should be 

              maintained. Not like Gaudiya Math. After Guru Maharaja's departure 

              so many <i>acaryas</i> came up.' (<i>TKG's Diary: Prabhupada's Final 

              Days</i>)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>So I think this GBC is Prabhupada's achievement, and therefore 

              I am convinced of the importance of trying to make it work.</p>

            <p>It is a difficult thing to do. Having been on the GBC for a long 

              time, I am aware of the problems. Devotees gather from all over 

              the world; they come from different backgrounds and different cultures, 

              and cultural misreadings between Westerners and Indians do take 

              place. And now the GBC has become very, very weak. The principal 

              reason for this has been the fall-down of spiritual masters and 

              the decay of spiritual authority in general. This applies to <i>sannyasis,</i> 

              gurus and the GBC. There has been a big overlap of these three categories, 

              and they are all in disrepute. The renounced order of life has come 

              to be called the denounced order of life - we hear that all the 

              time. People are very dubious about gurus - everyone is wondering 

              when the next one is going to fall. And the GBC seems to be floundering 

              and cannot do anything about it. There is a feeling that we do not 

              know where our vision is going to come from.</p>

            <p>We need to have vision; illumination, light, should come from the 

              GBC. The conditions under which vision, illumination or enlightenment 

              takes place come from Krsna.</p>

            <p align="center"><i>sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto<br>

              </i><i>mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca</i></p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>'I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, 

              knowledge and forgetfulness.' (<i>Bhagavad-gita </i>15.15)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>The people who lead this movement are supposed to be those who 

              are actually directed and guided in their intelligence by Krsna. 

              If that direction and guidance is not there, then we have to think, 

              'What is wrong, and how do I create the conditions under which they 

              can take place?' </p>

            <p>The <i>sankirtana</i> movement is not an individual matter; it 

              has to be a group event. What I would like to do, to the extent 

              that I have some influence on things, is to create the conditions 

              under which illumination, enlightenment and vision do take place. 

              What I'm asking for, you could say, is Pentecost - a sense of the 

              holy spirit - when the GBC meets. This was certainly Prabhupada's 

              purpose for the GBC meetings. That is why he wanted them in Mayapura, 

              a holy place. Prabhupada expected this to happen. At the same time, 

              Prabhupada really wanted us to work by a parliamentary procedure. 

              So there is parliamentary procedure and Pentecost. How do these 

              two things go together?</p>

            <p>Prabhupada appreciated parliamentary procedure so much that when 

              he instituted the GBC in 1975, he sat there and raised his hand 

              with everyone else. Over the past five or six years, parliamentary 

              procedure has been more and more disregarded by the GBC. When I 

              did some research on parliamentary procedure, I found it was designed 

              to achieve the desire of the deliberative majority. Now, 'deliberative 

              majority' is not the same thing as 'unanimous'. There will be decisions 

              that some will disagree with. But the people who are in disagreement 

              will be heard, and their opinion will have been stated fully before 

              the decision is made. That is the principle of co-operation - once 

              you have gone through the procedure, you accept its outcome. If 

              you wish to challenge a decision, there are lawful ways of doing 

              so. That is the basis of parliamentary procedure, and it's actually 

              quite impressive. Prabhupada wanted the GBC to be run on this basis, 

              but at the same time he wanted it to convene in a holy place; he 

              wanted the devotees to gather together in spiritual association, 

              and he wanted the GBC to be able to receive inspiration and guidance 

              from Krsna, the Supersoul, who in this case has exactly the same 

              function as the holy spirit.</p>

            <p>In <i>The</i> <i>Nectar of Instruction </i>Prabhupada talks about 

              the general condition that we have to be in to receive direction 

              and guidance from Krsna. The first verse reads as follows:</p>

            <p align="center"><i>vaco vegam manasah krodha-vegam<br>

              </i><i>jihva-vegam udaropastha-vegam<br>

              </i><i>etan vegan yo visaheta dhirah<br>

              </i><i>sarvam apimam prthivim sa sisyat</i></p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the 

              mind's demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, 

              belly and genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world. 

              (Prabhupada, 1975, p. 1)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>In the preface, which serves as a commentary on the first verse, 

              Prabhupada says, 'In all spiritual affairs, one's first duty is 

              to control his mind and his senses. Unless one controls his mind 

              and senses, one cannot make any advancement in spiritual life. Everyone 

              in this material life is engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance. 

              One must promote himself to the platform of goodness, <i>sattva-guna,</i> 

              by following the instructions of Rupa Goswami, and then everything 

              concerning how to make future progress will be revealed.' </p>

            <p>Prabhupada uses this word 'revealed.' This is not to say that everyone 

              in the mode of goodness gets revelations, but devotees on this platform 

              will know what to do; there will be reciprocation. If you look at 

              the purport to <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>4.18.5, Prabhupada again 

              talks about how this movement receives guidance: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>At this moment it has become fashionable to disobey the 

              unimpeachable directions given by the <i>acaryas</i> and liberated 

              souls of the past. Presently people are so fallen that they cannot 

              distinguish between a liberated soul and a conditioned soul. A conditioned 

              soul is hampered by four defects: he is sure to commit mistakes, 

              he is sure to become illusioned, he has a tendency to cheat others, 

              and his senses are imperfect. Consequently we have to take direction 

              from liberated persons. (Prabhupada, 1978, Fourth Canto, Vol. 2, 

              p. 387)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Now, at this point in Prabhupada's purport, you might expect Prabhupada 

              to describe how to recognise a liberated person. This is how the 

              purport continues: 'This Krsna consciousness movement directly receives 

              instruction from the Supreme Personality of Godhead via persons 

              who are strictly following His instructions.' So that is the substitution 

              for liberated persons: 'from persons who are strictly following 

              His instructions.' Prabhupada continues: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Although the follower may not be a liberated person, if 

              he follows the supreme, liberated Personality of Godhead his actions 

              are naturally liberated from the contamination of the material nature. 

              Lord Caitanya therefore says: 'By my order, you may become a spiritual 

              master.' One can immediately become a spiritual master by having 

              full faith in the transcendental word of the Supreme Personality 

              of Godhead and by following His instructions.</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>When Prabhupada talks about spiritual master, he means all kinds 

              of <i>siksa</i> guru - anyone who is actually giving spiritual guidance 

              and instruction to anybody else should be qualified in this way. 

              So here Prabhupada emphasises this strict following.</p>

            <p>We find the same instructions in a quotation by Lord Caitanya to 

              the <i>brahmana </i>Kurma. Prabhupada also uses this quotation a 

              lot. Brahmana Kurma is worried that if Lord Caitanya goes away, 

              he will fall into <i>maya </i>again. Lord Caitanya says, </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>If you follow this instruction, your materialistic life 

              at home will not obstruct your spiritual advancement. Indeed, if 

              you follow these regulative principles, we will again meet here, 

              or, rather, you will never lose My company. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, 

              Madhya-lila </i>7.129)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>So this is how to maintain association with the spiritual master 

              by <i>vani-seva</i>; Prabhupada refers to this topic in the <i>Bhagavatam</i> 

              when he explains the allegory of King Puranjana, who becomes the 

              daughter of the King Vidarbha in his next life and is then married 

              to King Malayadhvaja. After her royal consort passes away, she laments. 

              Prabhupada explains that figuratively speaking, the king is the 

              spiritual master and the queen is his disciple. Thus, when the mortal 

              body of the spiritual master expires, his disciples should cry exactly 

              as the queen cries when the king leaves his body. However, the disciple 

              and the spiritual master are never separated because the spiritual 

              master always keeps company with the disciple. As Prabhupada made 

              clear later on, this means he still gives guidance and direction. 

            </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>The spiritual master always keeps company with the disciple 

              as long as his disciple follows strictly the instructions of the 

              spiritual master. This is called association of <i>vani</i> (words). 

              Physical presence is called <i>vapuh</i>. As long as the spiritual 

              master is physically present, the disciple should serve the physical 

              body of the spiritual master. When the spiritual master is no longer 

              physically existing, the disciple should serve the instructions 

              of the spiritual master. (Prabhupada, 1978, Fourth Canto, Vol. 4, 

              p. 228)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Of course, when I say spiritual master, I am thinking principally 

              of Prabhupada, but this is true for everyone's spiritual master, 

              either <i>diksa</i> or <i>siksa.</i></p>

            <p>When Prabhupada left the planet, ISKCON was faced with a crisis 

              of succession. Prabhupada essentially named the GBC as successors 

              in his will, but the GBC is not at the same standard as Prabhupada 

              - the transfer of charisma does not seem to have taken place. So 

              how is this supposed to happen? Well, Prabhupada tells us right 

              here - by following strictly the instructions of the spiritual master. 

            </p>

            <p>As the queen is about to immolate herself on the pyre of her husband, 

              a <i>brahmana</i> appears. He is described as an old friend of King 

              Puranjana. Allegorically speaking, the <i>brahmana</i> represents 

              the Supersoul. Prabhupada says when one becomes serious about following 

              the mission of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount 

              to seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. </p>

            <p align="center"><i>vyavasayatmika buddhir<br>

              </i><i>ekeha kuru-nandana<br>

              </i><i>bahu-sakha hy anantas ca<br>

              </i><i>buddhayo 'vyavasayinam</i></p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and 

              their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence 

              of those who are irresolute is many-branched. (<i>Bhagavad-gita 

              </i>2.41)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>This verse is commented on by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura; it 

              is a theme that runs throughout Prabhupada's writing and expresses 

              his personal realisation about accepting the spiritual master as 

              one's life and soul. Visvanatha Cakravarti says one should serve 

              the words of the spiritual master, and by simply following along 

              that line, he will see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prabhupada 

              elaborates on this: </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>If a disciple is very serious to execute the instructions 

              of the spiritual master, he immediately associates with the Supreme 

              Personality of Godhead by <i>vani </i>or <i>vapuh</i>. That is the 

              only secret of success in seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 

              (Prabhupada, 1978, Fourth Canto, Vol. 4, p. 235)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>In the purport to the next verse, Prabhupada also teaches that 

              seeing the Supersoul seated within everyone's heart is possible 

              only when one is completely free from the contamination of material 

              attachment. </p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote>One who is sincere and pure gets an opportunity to consult 

              with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature 

              sitting within everyone's heart. The Paramatma is always the <i>caitya-guru</i>, 

              the spiritual master within, and He comes before one externally 

              as the instructor and initiator spiritual master. The Lord can reside 

              within the heart, and He can also come out before a person and give 

              him instructions. Thus the spiritual master is not different from 

              the Supersoul sitting within the heart. (Prabhupada, 1978, Fourth 

              Canto, Vol. 4, p. 235)</blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>When the <i>brahmana</i> asked the woman who the man lying on the 

              floor was, she replied he was her spiritual master and that she 

              was perplexed by what to do in his absence. At such a time, the 

              Supersoul immediately appears, provided the devotee has become pure 

              of heart by following the directions of the spiritual master. A 

              sincere devotee who follows the instructions of the spiritual master 

              certainly gets direct instructions from his heart from the Supersoul. 

              Thus the sincere devotee is always helped directly or indirectly 

              by the spiritual master and the Supersoul. </p>

            <p>These are Prabhupada's particular instructions about what to do 

              when the spiritual master is gone. So now we understand what has 

              to happen. People have said that the problem with our movement is 

              we do not have any self-effulgent <i>acaryas.</i> Prabhupada says 

              that is not what is required. We simply need to strictly follow 

              Prabhupada's instructions - that would be adequate. </p>

            <p>Prabhupada set up the annual GBC meetings so that decisions could 

              be made and some enlightenment received. I have given some thought 

              to how these meetings might be conducted. My notion was that there 

              would be one day of spiritual retreat for every three days of parliamentary 

              procedure. As an example of the activities occurring during the 

              days of spiritual retreat, we might take a statement such as, 'the 

              GBC is the custodian of the legacy of Srila Prabhupada', and make 

              it the subject of discussion and meditation. We would not hold these 

              sessions in the meeting room, but rather go and sit down in front 

              of Prabhupada at his <i>samadhi </i>in Mayapura, all perform <i>guru-puja</i> 

              together for Prabhupada, and then discuss the topic in front of 

              the deity of Prabhupada. The questions raised during this discussion 

              might include, What is the legacy of Prabhupada? What does it mean 

              to be the custodian of it? What are we supposed to be doing? What 

              can we do to succeed where we have failed? </p>

            <p>After a day of meditative reflection, there could be a few more 

              days of meetings, followed by another retreat, perhaps this time 

              in front of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's <i>samadhi,</i> then Bhaktivinoda 

              Thakura's <i>samadhi</i> and finally in front of Prabhupada once 

              more. At the end of the meetings, we could engage in a more formally 

              directed process of strategic planning involving resolutions and 

              proposals, through an organised series of reflections. By the end 

              of the meeting we would have an idea of where are we now, where 

              we want to go, the steps to be taken to get there and the obstacles 

              to be overcome. If we organise ourselves in this way, it will make 

              a different kind of impression on the devotees present in Mayapura 

              at that time, who are either participating in the meetings in some 

              way or who merely want to know what is going on. </p>

            <p>In the Bible, John 13, which contains the apostle John's version 

              of the last supper, Jesus puts on the garb of a servant, wraps a 

              cloth around his waist and washes the feet of his disciples. Some 

              devotees believe this is something the GBC should perform. Some 

              devotees believe this is something the GBC should contemplate. Although 

              I think having the GBC wash feet may be too much, there <i>could 

              </i>be a GBC <i>prasadam</i> day, where all the members of the GBC 

              cook a feast, offer it to Prabhupada and serve it to the devotees. 

              It would be good for the GBC because it would force everyone to 

              work together on a practical, goal-directed task. </p>

            <p>These are the kinds of things I am thinking about, at least for 

              the GBC meetings. Things that are done in Mayapura are very powerful, 

              and I think this was Prabhupada's intention with this Mayapura meeting. 

            </p>

            <p>Prabhupada's idea was that after the meetings ended, the GBC members 

              would go to G<i>aura-purnima</i> together. I would like to arrange 

              things so that at the end of meetings, there would be about three 

              or four days of group seminars, in which various members of the 

              GBC would give a presentation on topics relevant to the devotees. 

              We did it this year, and many members of the GBC gave courses on 

              different topics after the meeting. I think it went well, but it 

              was an individual thing, with devotees speaking on topics relating 

              to their own particular interests, whereas I would like to see those 

              presentations linked to what has been discussed at the GBC meetings. 

              There is supposed to be <i>ista-gosthi</i> after these meetings 

              - this would be a more organised <i>ista-gosthi</i>.</p>

            <p>Essentially, I want to set up the conditions under which long-term 

              vision can emerge from the group as a body. For some time the GBC 

              has been in agreement that ISKCON should be seen primarily as an 

              organisation for education and training; in the long term, our idea 

              is to create the culture of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> and the holy 

              name, and to provide the existential conditions under which everyone 

              can have realisation. This means that there really has to be the 

              culture of the holy name and the culture of the <i>Bhagavatam. </i>There 

              are certain things that we have to do to achieve these conditions, 

              however. For example, we need to follow the order of the spiritual 

              master, which first and foremost means to cultivate the holy name 

              while very diligently trying to give up offences. According to the 

              philosophy of the holy name given by Haridasa Thakura, if you perform 

              these actions you are on the platform of <i>namabhasa</i>, which 

              gives liberation and certainly brings you to the <i>brahma-bhuta</i> 

              platform. If you keep on going, very soon you will have <i>krsna-prema.</i> 

              There has not been a scrupulous attempt to avoid offences to the 

              holy name while chanting, at least on the part of many of our leaders, 

              and I believe there would not have been so many people falling down 

              if there had. </p>

            <p>Devotees are really afraid that their gurus <i>will</i> fall down. 

              We have spiritual masters in the movement who do not talk to each 

              other about what they are doing. When I was teaching English at 

              college, every so often all the professors and instructors in the 

              English department would be handed the same student essay and asked 

              to grade it. When everyone gathered together afterwards, you would 

              find that someone had given the essay an 'A', whereas somebody else 

              had given it a 'D', prompting everyone to ask, 'What are our standards?' 

              Something like this should be undertaken within the GBC. Ultimately, 

              as part of our mission, there should be ongoing training, education 

              and evaluation of gurus.</p>

            <p>While spiritual masters are giving initiations and taking on disciples, 

              they also have their own spiritual offences to deal with. I believe 

              there should be a time each year when all spiritual masters go to 

              a place of pilgrimage where for one month they chant rounds, perform 

              austerities and engage in purifying activities so that they will 

              be able to help discharge the accumulated burdens of sinful reactions 

              built up by initiating disciples, especially if the guru has not 

              been perfectly following himself. It is very important to do this, 

              and it would give the disciples a lot more confidence in their gurus. 

              I also believe that so far, ISKCON has been running on<b> </b>the 

              credit of Prabhupada's austerities and that one day we ourselves 

              are going to have to be a little more austere because the bank account 

              will be empty. We are going to have to build up our capital again 

              from people who are coming after Srila Prabhupada. </p>

            <p>I think you will find that if there is vision, management will 

              quickly follow. I do not think that GBC members have to be managers 

              themselves, but they have to ensure that the management is sound. 

              If this happens, I think devotees' lives will improve, they will 

              have more spiritual enlightenment and become happier in the Hare 

              Krsna movement. It is ultimately a spiritual problem, and this is 

              the way to dealing with it. I will be putting these ideas before 

              the other members of the GBC Executive Committee for their input. 

              I am also trying to get myself in the proper position to receive 

              guidance from Krsna so that I can take things in the right direction. 

              I ask for your prayers and blessings that I can serve you in the 

              way that Krsna wants me to.</p>
