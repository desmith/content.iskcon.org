            <p>To understand the seriousness of a disease it is important to recognise 

              its symptoms. Otherwise, by minimising or ignoring the symptoms, 

              the body may be invaded by a terrible, even fatal, illness. </p>

            <p>During the following testimonials, we ask that you keep an open 

              mind, attentive ear, and most importantly, a non-prejudiced heart. 

              These histories are important because they exemplify the severity 

              of disregard for women in our society during the middle to late 

              1970s. At this time, as documented in Jyotirmayi's paper,<sup><a href="#1d">1</a><a name="1"></a> 

              </sup>many women were relieved of their services, had to stand in 

              the back of the temple rooms during <i>aratis</i> and were sent 

              out of the temple rooms for <i>japa</i>. There was even talk of 

              asking all the women to leave the temples, and moving to Australia. 

            </p>

            <p>In total, there were at least five women's parties operating just 

              before Srila Prabhupada's disappearance. Each party had approximately 

              twenty-five or more members. More than sixty women were asked to 

              serve on Jiva's party. Of these, at least twenty were approached 

              by Jiva for illicit sex. Five of these women were 'legally' married 

              to Jiva. There have been reports of at least three abortions. </p>

            <p>These women had little or no shelter because the women's parties 

              were apparently supported by both temple leaders and Governing Body 

              Commissioners. When women went to temple authorities they were sent 

              back to the party where they were publicly admonished and punished. 

              Three GBCs were sent to investigate Jiva's party more than a year 

              before its final demise but no action was taken, perhaps because 

              the cash collections were very high. </p>

            <p>Many of you have probably wondered why we felt it was so important 

              to establish the Women's Ministry. Perhaps I can shed some light 

              on this by sharing a few personal experiences and thoughts. Perhaps 

              also, through my testimony and what you have heard from my Godsisters, 

              you will understand that this is not feminism, but rather a sincere 

              attempt to create an environment conducive to devotional service 

              for Vaisnavis. I hope that you will also recognise that the seeds 

              of injustice towards, and prejudice against, women still bear fruit 

              today. </p>

            <p>Within two weeks of my joining the Hare Krsna movement, Jiva's 

              party was formed. I became one of its initial three members and 

              remained a member from the day it was formed until the day it ended. 

              By Krsna's grace and kindness, I was naïve and thus unaware of Jiva's 

              sexual intimations towards me or my Godsisters. Looking back, the 

              significance of many experiences have become apparent and are shocking, 

              but worse was bearing witness to the suffering of my devoted Godsisters. 

              Even though unaware of the details, the pain was evident, immeasurable 

              and unbearable to watch. Clearly, these experiences reflected a 

              perversion of the edicts of protection for women. </p>

            <p>After Jiva's party broke apart, I was given the opportunity to 

              increase my preaching role. Thus I moved overseas and began preaching 

              in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. By Krsna's 

              mercy, despite many difficulties, I was able to meet dignitaries 

              and hold large preaching engagements as I travelled alone, or with 

              a small team of <i>brahmacarinis</i>,<i> </i>from town to town. 

            </p>

            <p>At one point, I and four other ladies maintained a centre in Bagio, 

              Philippines, which prospered until we were told to leave. Next, 

              through our own efforts, we were able to open a beautiful restaurant 

              in Manila. When the restaurant became successful, I was told it 

              was now time to put someone serious in charge; that a woman's nature 

              did not allow her to bear the managerial responsibility of such 

              a project. Unfortunately, the restaurant closed within weeks of 

              my departure. </p>

            <p>After a pilgrimage to Vrndavana I returned to the USA. Because 

              I was recovering from malaria, I was not able to go out and collect, 

              so I was given a van and a younger <i>bramacarini</i>, and told 

              to go out and do something. Again through Krsna's grace, we were 

              able in one month to sell many books, including two full sets of 

              <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>and a complete set of <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. 

              We had made six new devotees and were offered the opportunity for 

              radio and television spots, as well as a gift of 100 acres of land. 

              Upon returning to the Portland temple happy and exuberant, I was 

              physically assaulted by the Temple President (who had warmly received 

              us only a few weeks earlier) and told to never come back. After 

              returning to my home centre, I was told not to mention a word of 

              my preaching programme to anyone, or I would be asked to leave the 

              temple. </p>

            <p>I do not know if the opposition to my efforts was due to a fear 

              of losing collectors - who may prefer to preach - or to being a 

              successful woman preacher, or both. I can only tell you that these 

              were the most empowered days of my Krsna consciousness, and that 

              every night I went to sleep with a smile on my face; every day having 

              had a mystical experience in preaching.</p>

            <p>In New Vrindaban, I was able to open a bookstore in the basement 

              of the Palace of Gold. From there, with very little support from 

              the management, and with my young baby girl in tow, by Srila Prabhupada's 

              mercy I was able to distribute a sizeable quantity of Srila Prabhupada's 

              books. This effort was easy because of the grandeur of the Palace 

              and the sincerity of the devotees. Unfortunately, like so many previous 

              efforts, it was not to last. I had just completed a Labor Day weekend 

              of book sales that totalled $10,000 when I was once again informed 

              that it was now time to bring in a more qualified individual. I 

              will not dwell here on the demoralising manner in which the transition 

              took place, but I will say that after my departure from the New 

              Vrindaban book store, the sales immediately decreased to less than 

              a tenth of what they had been when it was under my care. </p>

            <p>More detrimental to me than the ill fate of being on a women's 

              party was my arranged marriage. It was determined that the solution 

              to the numerous fall-downs of New Vrindaban's residing spiritual 

              leader would be to give many of the men <i>sannyasa</i> and to marry 

              off all of the women. Upon hearing of this decision, I approached 

              one of the leading household couples in our community to inquire 

              about one Godbrother I thought might be interested in marrying me. 

              Unfortunately he was one of the candidates for <i>sannyasa</i> and 

              thus I was kicked out of the <i>asrama</i> and forced to live outside, 

              alone in the <i>sankirtana</i> van. </p>

            <p>After returning to the <i>asrama</i>, it became apparent that I 

              was earmarked to marry a man of very low character. Understanding 

              the intention, I began fasting and praying to the Lord for understanding. 

              After several days, I had no answer, so I also stopped drinking 

              water. After four days of not drinking water and not eating, I received 

              a phone call. 'Please break your fast, I will not force you to do 

              anything against your will.' You can imagine my surprise and dismay 

              when less then two weeks later, my marriage to this very same man 

              was unexpectedly announced at <i>guru-puja</i>. </p>

            <p>I was tired and weak from the fast and had no fight left in me. 

              I felt that for some unknown reason, Krsna wanted me to surrender. 

              Thus, after years of ardent service and unflinching dedication to 

              the regulative principles, book distribution and preaching, I found 

              myself married to a low-class, disturbed individual who smoked, 

              drank, stayed out nights roaming the streets of the gay sections 

              of San Francisco, regularly forced himself upon me sexually, beat 

              me and tore up everything I owned. He even gave me a disease that 

              is a known link to cervical cancer, a disease for which I have recently 

              undergone extensive surgery in what then appeared to be a life-threatening 

              circumstance. </p>

            <p>Finally, I moved to Philadelphia, were I was blessed with mature 

              and rational Krsna conscious association. Our Temple President never 

              infringed on my devotional service, in fact he encouraged me and 

              provided facility in numerous ways. </p>

            <p>More importantly, for the first time in my Krsna consciousness, 

              I had the association of my older Godsisters: Vaisnavis who knew 

              Srila Prabhupada, who had travelled with him and been given personal 

              instruction. I felt a sense of belonging. These ladies endeared 

              themselves to me, reinstated my trust in Srila Prabhupada's movement 

              and reinvigorated my heart. I was indebted to them in the deepest 

              sense possible. I came to understand that the unpleasant experiences 

              of my past were not isolated incidents. In fact, a seeming majority 

              of my Godsisters had undergone similar experiences, and as I listened 

              I found each story more unbelievable than the last. It was at this 

              time that I resolved to do everything I could to help my Godsisters, 

              whatever the cost. </p>

            <p>The stories I've mentioned represent a minute segment of the misfortune 

              I and others experienced. If you believe these are tales of ISKCON's 

              distant past, my present service to the Women's Ministry has taught 

              me otherwise. </p>

            <p>One vivid and unforgettable impression I have received while in 

              the service of Women's Minister came from a note scrawled at the 

              end of a confidential survey which read, 'in dedication to ... Dasi, 

              a dear friend who has been killed at the hands of her husband'. 

              I have also been told several heartbreaking stories of forced marriages 

              that resulted in molestation and physical and sexual assault of 

              wives and children. </p>

            <p>We sit before you now, a ragtag remnant of Srila Prabhupada's female 

              disciple army. Each one of us had considerable reservations about 

              making this journey and each of us came at substantial personal 

              sacrifice. One of the ladies here has even lost her means of livelihood 

              as a result of taking extended time off work. But we came out of 

              a sense of duty and concern; concern that extends, in truth, beyond 

              our compassion for other female devotees. </p>

            <p>It is our perception that our movement is becoming more and more 

              fragmented due to a lack of empathy, understanding, honesty, and 

              trust amongst our Society's members, and thus our Society's heart 

              is being torn apart. Perhaps the desire to renounce the object of 

              sense gratification has led to a denouncement of women devotees, 

              which in turn results in a denial of the more feminine Vaisnava 

              qualities that each one of us holds within the core of our hearts 

              - qualities that may now be needed to re-instil the trust and faith 

              of our Society's members. </p>

            <p>Despite the sufferings of the past, our concern is not for ourselves, 

              but rather for the health and well-being of our Society. Please 

              give us the opportunity to serve co-operatively and respectfully 

              together, so that we may all fully contribute our talents and abilities 

              in the service of our spiritual master.</p>
