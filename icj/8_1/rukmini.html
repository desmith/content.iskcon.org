            <p>We have been enriched in ISKCON by the <i>sannyasa</i> culture 

              many of the GBC represent. Perhaps no other spiritual organisation 

              has this strength of austerity. But in our efforts to follow Srila 

              Prabhupada in his austerity and carefulness in dealings between 

              men and women, the women of ISKCON have been denigrated. We are 

              becoming more impoverished by not honouring our diversity.</p>

            <p>One example of how a culture is enriched by diverse voices is given 

              in the <i>Bhagavatam</i> story of the Pandavas' judgement against 

              Asvatthama for killing the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Bhima wanted 

              an eye for an eye. Draupadi, the bereaved mother of the slain children, 

              thought compassionately of the mother of Asvatthama, their family 

              relationship and the honour owed Asvatthama as a <i>brahmana</i>, 

              and urged that Asvatthama's life be spared. Arjuna, by his keen 

              intelligence, sought the counsel of all and, balancing all, made 

              the decision that pleased Lord Krsna.</p>

            <p>In our Society, unscrupulous men, often in managerial positions, 

              have abused and neglected women. Under these conditions, women lose 

              their sense of worth as beloved daughters of Srila Prabhupada and 

              lose their voice within the assembly of devotees. With no standing 

              in the devotional community, women, especially those abandoned by 

              their husbands, become degraded and cannot protect their children. 

              Children become like orphans, 'unwanted progeny', as Arjuna says 

              in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, not recognised as the 'Vaikuntha children' 

              they are by birthright. Instead of the 'future saviours of the world', 

              as one <i>gurukula </i>promotional piece states, second-generation 

              devotees become angry, frustrated and want to sue ISKCON because 

              of their pain. </p>

            <p>Our Society is being judged by how we treat our most vulnerable 

              members. As Jesus Christ said: 'As you do unto the least of these, 

              you do unto me.' Similarly, what we do to the least of these, we 

              do to Srila Prabhupada. The abuses and neglect of women and children 

              must be corrected immediately, as our sexist and inhumane behaviour 

              reflects badly on Srila Prabhupada and taints his movement in the 

              eyes of the world.</p>

            <p>Instead of Vaisnava etiquette we have elitism - a culture of those 

              who have and those who have not - and women occupy the lower rungs. 

              Many gurus and <i>sannyasis</i>, as they grow elderly or infirm, 

              will have the finest medical care in the homes of wealthy disciples 

              and admirers. Women, especially women without husbands, children, 

              second-generation devotees, and soon-to-be elderly persons, are 

              treated as second- and third-class citizens in our society. What 

              will happen to these devotees as they grow older? Where are the 

              systems for their protection?</p>

            <p>We are hearing the call for accountability from all sides. In the 

              1996 survey requested by the GBC, sociologist Burke Rochford, after 

              interviewing hundreds of devotees, concluded that the community 

              of devotees has little trust in ISKCON's leadership.</p>

            <p>About two years ago my husband (Anuttama Dasa), Ravindra Svarupa 

              Prabhu and I met with the leaders of the anti-cult movement in North 

              America. In a private meeting, we requested that they no longer 

              refer to us as a cult. They said that for them to refrain from calling 

              us a cult they would have to see evidence of accountability. They 

              requested a position statement enumerating point-by-point how we 

              are caring for our devotees. Krsna is speaking to us through our 

              so-called enemies.</p>

            <p>How can we expect our devotees to offer love and surrender if their 

              human needs are not met and if our leaders do not love them? It 

              is the responsibility of the GBC to maintain the quality of life 

              of the devotees. Each devotee should feel enveloped in a loving 

              network. If devotees felt supported spiritually, emotionally and 

              practically, there would be little danger of being vulnerable to 

              <i>rtvik </i>or other aberrant philosophies. Philosophical deviations 

              are a symptom of the vacancy that devotees feel in their hearts 

              when they are seen only as a means to fill a service or collect 

              money. As leaders, you meet women in the course of your preaching. 

              Often you give more deference to these women than to your Godsisters, 

              whom Srila Prabhupada considered Vaisnavis and more intelligent 

              than ordinary women.</p>

            <p>We all hope to remember Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet at the time 

              of death. But if we fall short of our goal because of offences or 

              sins remaining in our hearts, some of us may take our next birth 

              as women in this Society. The GBC decisions you make now will determine 

              whether or not some of us will walk in fear of abuse in the future 

              ISKCON.</p>

            <p>We need each other - <i>sannyasis</i>, <i>grhasthas</i>, women 

              - all have diverse and enriching roles to play. Jayadvaita Svami 

              says that what ISKCON needs is grandmothers. In a culture where 

              we feel safe to give and receive love - <i>dadati pratigrhnati</i><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>- 

              devotees who have some difficulty will not fear being ostracised 

              and will not leave ISKCON to seek community or compassion elsewhere.</p>

            <p>I recently spent two days at the Chowpatty temple in Mumbai. It 

              is a striking example of an ISKCON community that works. The resident 

              <i>sannyasi</i> is not micro-managing - he is not managing at all. 

              Instead, he is inspiring the <i>grhasthas</i>, who are fathering 

              and mothering the <i>brahmacaris </i>and enthusiastically financing 

              the community projects. The <i>brahmacaris </i>are not hustling 

              for money but are engaged in preaching, study, and worship of the 

              Deity. We should study this and other examples of successful communities 

              within our movement and try to replicate that success. </p>

            <p>When I see the beautiful <i>puspa-samadhi</i> of Srila Prabhupada 

              with all the male figures in <i>kirtana</i>, I feel excluded. Half 

              of Srila Prabhupada's disciples are not represented. My Godsisters 

              and I are also part of that <i>kirtana</i>. Srila Prabhupada's glory 

              is that he brought so many diverse people to worship Lord Caitanya 

              here at Sridhama Mayapura and fulfilled the prediction of Srila 

              Bhaktivinoda Thakura. Chinese, Africans, Europeans, Americans - 

              and women - all should be represented. Whose movement is this? Is 

              it your movement, or does it belong to all of us? As Srila Prabhupada 

              wrote to Atreya Rsi, 'You must learn to get along with your Godbrothers 

              because in the spiritual world Brahmananda will be there, Syamasundara 

              will be there.' So in the spiritual sky, Yamuna will be there, Kausalya 

              will be there, Visakha will be there, all joining in the <i>kirtana</i>.</p>

            <p>If ISKCON is to be considered relevant, the voices of our women 

              need to be heard. Yamuna, Visakha, Sitala, and other women are highly 

              intelligent, glued to Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet, and their <i>sadhana</i> 

              is impeccable. How enriched this GBC body would be to regularly 

              receive their wise perspectives.</p>

            <p>Before I conclude I'd like to quote Radha Devi Dasi, a Harvard 

              law graduate:</p>

            <p>I have been asked to express some thoughts on the roles and treatment 

              of women in our ISKCON society. There are a number of viewpoints 

              on this issue, but I would like to raise two points that I believe 

              are at the heart of the apparent dilemma we face. First, we misunderstand 

              our own philosophy and misrepresent our founder-<i>acarya, </i>Srila 

              Prabhupada, if we develop institutional structures that operate 

              as barriers to the integration of women into our ISKCON society. 

              Second, if we truly wish to build a Vaisnava community as well as 

              a religious institution, then it is imperative that we permit women's 

              voices to be heard in our public discourse.</p>

            <p>Our own Vaisnava traditions and heritage are the best possible 

              evidence that women have a valuable voice in our society. It is 

              a mistake to contend that Vaisnava philosophy requires that women 

              fill one, and only one, social role. In the first place, Srila Prabhupada 

              made clear that our Vaisnava heritage is one of flexibility and 

              adaptation with the goal of bringing as many people as possible 

              to the practice of Krsna consciousness. It is essential that we 

              remember words spoken by Srila Prabhupada in the purport to text 

              1, chapter 4 in the First Canto of the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>:</p>

            <p>Personal realization does not mean that one should, out of vanity, 

              attempt to show one's own learning by trying to surpass the previous 

              <i>acarya</i>. He must have full confidence in the previous <i>acarya</i>, 

              and at the same time he must realize the subject matter so nicely 

              that he can present the matter for the particular circumstances 

              in a suitable manner. The original purpose of the text must be maintained. 

              No obscure meaning should be screwed out of it, yet it should be 

              presented in an interesting manner for the understanding of the 

              audience. This is called realization.</p>

            <p>Our Vaisnava history is not intended as a set of chains which will 

              bind modern persons to an historic lifestyle which has not existed 

              anywhere on this earth in a pure form for thousands of years. Used 

              in such a way, our Vaisnava history becomes a bar - prohibiting 

              others from approaching Krsna - and we fail to fulfill the injunction 

              laid upon us by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to become spiritual masters 

              and free the entire world. Our preaching, no matter how emphatic, 

              is flawed if we cannot convince others to take up the practice of 

              serving Krsna.</p>

            <p>This discussion of the uses and place of our history and tradition 

              has a profound impact on the actual operations and effectiveness 

              of our institution. By arguing that women must keep to traditional 

              roles for which they may not be suited, by preventing them from 

              participating in services where they could excel, and by forcing 

              them to 'stand in the back' both literally and figuratively, we 

              diminish our ability to function as Srila Prabhupada desired.</p>

            <p>It is no secret that ISKCON's treatment of women and children has 

              drawn criticism from anti-cult groups, rights organisations and 

              even governmental bodies. It is easy, but foolish, to dismiss such 

              criticism as envy or the uninformed opinion of materialists. In 

              taking such a position we force ourselves to defend the indefensible. 

              Our own history includes women who served as spiritual masters and 

              engaged in public <i>kirtana </i>and preaching. Srila Prabhupada 

              himself engaged women in management, public preaching, his personal 

              service, in fact, in virtually every aspect of his newly formed 

              ISKCON organisation. Why should we offend half the world's population 

              in order to uphold a 'tradition' with which even Srila Prabhupada 

              was willing to dispense?</p>

            <p>Most women in ISKCON are engaged in traditional roles. We are mothers, 

              wives, cooks, housekeepers and caretakers. We cook, we clean, we 

              care for the children and the men in our Society, as well as caring 

              for each other. But these tasks are not the whole of our abilities 

              or of the contribution we have to make to Srila Prabhupada's movement.</p>

            <p>In fact, it is our very participation in the 'private sphere' that 

              gives us a unique contribution to the public discourse. There are 

              important gender differences that cannot be ignored. This fact, 

              often used as an argument for silencing women, is actually a reason 

              why they should be involved in ISKCON's public discourse.</p>

            <p>Psychologists and others who have studied gender differences have 

              concluded that women are, either through biology or socialisation, 

              more invested in personal relationships than men are. They are more 

              concerned with the welfare of others and more likely to be forgiving, 

              insofar as they are more concerned with the facts of the case than 

              the letter of the law. These findings are no different in their 

              essentials from traditional Vaisnava thinking about the nature of 

              women. As a consequence of these differences, women have a unique 

              contribution to make to our Society.</p>

            <p>Our Vaisnava society suffers when women are excluded from its public 

              life, from decision-making, management and formation of policy. 

              Our institution is then off balance, with too much weight given 

              to legalistic concerns and not enough to human ones, just as a family 

              without a mother may lack a warm and nurturing centre.</p>

            <p>The viewpoints and contributions of both men and women are needed 

              if ISKCON is to grow and flourish in the future.</p>

            <p>In conclusion I have three requests for you to consider:</p>

            <p>1. Lend credibility to the Women's Ministry by increasing the representation 

              of women on the GBC on some level and inviting senior women to your 

              zones and temples to associate with your women devotees.</p>

            <p>2. Issue an apology to women for lack of protection and exploitation 

              under your management and the management of those who came before 

              you.</p>

            <p>3. Return to your respective zones and hold <i>ista-gosthis </i>in 

              each temple. As you travel, establish the priority of providing 

              equal facilities, full encouragement and genuine care and protection 

              to the women members of our society. Hold meetings with leaders 

              and women to openly address their needs and problems.</p>

            <p>You are the leaders of our Society. If you make the correction 

              of these abuses a priority, the position of women could be turned 

              around within one year. As I mentioned earlier, the 1996 GBC-authorised 

              survey of devotees told you that the devotional community has very 

              little faith and trust in you as leaders. These steps would be very 

              significant in re-establishing the community's faith in your leadership.</p>
