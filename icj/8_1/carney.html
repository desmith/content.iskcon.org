            <p>This meeting, which took place on April 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>, 

              was the third in a continuing series of dialogues held in the Washington 

              D.C. area. Participants included Christians from the Catholic, Episcopalian 

              and Anglican traditions and Vaisnavas from the Gaudiya tradition. 

              Because many of the participants have become friends as well as 

              dialogue partners during the three years of these meetings, we began 

              with a substantial common ground of trust and mutual understanding. 

              Returning to Rockwood Manor for the dialogue was like a homecoming. 

              We gathered on Friday afternoon to continue the theme of the previous 

              year, one that we had agreed we had only begun to explore. We listened 

              to two talks on the call to transform life and service in the Christian 

              and Vaisnava traditions, and we reflected on the implications of 

              this. The texts that served as the basis for these talks were taken 

              from the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and the Gospel of John, and had been 

              distributed to the participants in advance. The evening was a time 

              for sharing songs and memories. Saturday morning was an opportunity 

              to share in worship together - an experience that fosters growth 

              of the religious life in these traditions. As friends and companions 

              on a journey, we then took the more daring step of looking at documents 

              from the Vaisnava and Catholic traditions that give direction to 

              the process of dialogue. I say 'daring' because we moved beyond 

              mutual understanding and shared experience to look at the way our 

              traditions encourage and discourage a life of dialogue, 'an opportunity 

              to examine different perspectives in understanding how God interacts 

              with people of other faiths'. </p>

            <p>We were warmly welcomed by Anuttama Dasa, who introduced the participants. 

              It is amazing how short the introductions can be when many participants 

              are already trusted friends, and how focused the participants' self-descriptions 

              can be when they share a religious journey. We then turned to the 

              theme of how our religious traditions lead us both to withdraw from 

              attachment to the world and also to encounter the world in loving 

              service. </p>

            <p>Radha Dasi reflected on the transformation of renunciation in the 

              <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> looking especially at <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              18.49, 12.12, 5.2 and 2.47. She pointed to the 'domestication of 

              renunciation' through the change of consciousness called for in 

              the <i>Gita,</i> the renunciation of the fruits of action in devotional 

              service to the Lord. The transformation of action through the renunciation 

              of its fruits means that surrender to the Absolute includes the 

              carrying out of personal and social responsibilities. Since everything 

              belongs to the Lord, we are called to renounce material attachments 

              and, thus liberated from bondage, to place all our resources at 

              the service of the Lord, in selfless surrender without material 

              desire. She used the analogy of legal agency to describe the devotee 

              as one who acts completely for the Lord. From the perspective of 

              the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> liberation from material attachment seems 

              incomplete without the surrender of the self to the Lord in lived 

              service. She illustrated this devotional attitude by the example 

              of Druva Maharaja in <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> and with the devotional 

              poetry of Narottama Dasa Thakura and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura. 

              She concluded, 'The tension between renouncing worldly ties and 

              seeking a closer relationship with God is resolved not by rejecting 

              the world but by understanding its true relationship to God. As 

              we progress in spiritual life, we integrate the disparate parts 

              of ourselves and our world into a coherent whole which resonates 

              with the love of God.'</p>

            <p>Margo Stevenson turned our attention to one of the most dramatic 

              incidents in the Gospel of John: Jesus' washing of the feet of his 

              disciples at the Last Supper. She placed this narrative within the 

              very intimate context of Jesus' farewell to his disciples, in which 

              he gave them an example of what they also should do. She explored 

              two interpretations of the foot washing. The first interpretation 

              views the foot washing as a symbol of the sacrificial love of Jesus, 

              a love that was only fully understood by the disciples later, for 

              he as teacher and master washes the feet of his students - a dramatic 

              role reversal of the usual relationship of student-teacher and servant-master. 

              The second interpretation points beyond symbol to the actual living 

              of the disciples, to the attitudes of loving service and humility 

              that they were to show in ordinary life. It is clear from the placement 

              and development of this narrative that it reflects an essential 

              part of the Christian message as setting a model of behaviour for 

              the disciples of Jesus. </p>

            <p>Our discussion allowed for considerable latitude in learning from 

              each other how we each interpret scripture as a rule of life. The 

              Christian participants were asked many questions about the practical 

              significance of the foot washing narrative, the implied criticism 

              of social relationships, and the example of servant leadership that 

              Jesus embodied. The Vaisnava participants spoke of the transformative 

              quality of practical devotional renunciation. All shared insights 

              on the spiritual power of ordinary life, for example, the special 

              moments of divine grace experienced in marriage and the deep meditation 

              found in preparing food ('a cooking spirituality') that empties 

              the mind. Through this sharing of our rootedness in our traditions, 

              we learned a deeper understanding of devotional service and of a 

              life of loving care. After a delicious Ekadasi meal, we joined in 

              singing traditional Christian hymns and Vaisnava <i>bhajanas</i>.</p>

            <p>It has become tradition in this dialogue group that we start the 

              second day by sharing in an experience of prayer together. Father 

              Paul Lee led the group in a prayer that celebrated the 'gifts of 

              the Holy Spirit', the divine gifts of wisdom, understanding, counsel, 

              fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. This prayer ended 

              with a symbol we hold in common, the offering of incense. Anuttama 

              Dasa and Rukmini Dasi then led us in Vaisnava mantras and <i>bhajanas</i>, 

              and Bhaktitirtha Swami taught us from the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i> 

              There are so many ways in which differing traditions can exclude 

              others in worship, but this group has found a way to promote understanding 

              through sharing an accessible mode of prayer together.</p>

            <p>In the context of prayer, dialogue becomes easier - a simple, natural 

              thing to do. John Borelli and Anuttama Dasa had provided documents 

              on interreligious understanding from the Roman Catholic tradition 

              and from ISKCON. These are 'tough texts' because they manifest irreconcilable 

              differences between traditions as much as they speak of dialogue. 

              The Catholic documents included texts from the Second Vatican Council 

              (1965) as well as excerpts from the more recent <i>Ecclesia in Asia 

              </i>(1999). While many of these texts highlighted the distinctive 

              beliefs that set Christians apart, they also highlighted Christian 

              beliefs about the unity of the human race, the links between communion 

              (or solidarity) with others and dialogue, and the mission of Christians 

              to be a witness of God's presence in the world.</p>

            <p>Dialogue is 'not simply a strategy for peaceful coexistence between 

              peoples; it is an essential part of the Church's mission' (<i>Ecclesia 

              in Asia,</i> p. 29). The need to enter into lived dialogue with 

              others thus emerges out of the logic of Christian faith itself. 

              We then turned to the ISKCON document 'ISKCON in Relation to People 

              of Faith in God' (<i>ISKCON Communications Journal, </i>June 1999). 

              We had the luxury of some first-hand knowledge of the development 

              of this document among the conference participants. We spent some 

              time discussing the relation between ISKCON and other Hindus, as 

              well as the differences and similarities between ISKCON's beliefs 

              and those of other Hindus. Although the occasion for this text was 

              quite different from that of the Catholic statement, there were 

              similarities between them with regard to the need to understand 

              the convictions that practitioners of both traditions hold with 

              firm faith, and the need to make that understanding the basis for 

              dialogue. Dialogue, openness to others, and a disposition to learn 

              from others - all are impossible without a firm grounding in one's 

              own faith tradition. The terms 'dialogue and mission' are found 

              in the ISKCON document as well; this document reflects a deep awareness 

              of the creative tension between these two aspects of ISKCON's Vaisnava 

              faith. This awareness on the part of Vaisnavas and Christians was 

              present in our dialogue as well. Although we had to break for lunch 

              long before we wanted, we all received a deeper sense of the seriousness 

              of our conversation because it was grounded in candid statements 

              of our differing beliefs.</p>

            <p>We promised to meet 'same time, same place, next year' with a focus 

              on texts of 'applied spiritual practice' which show the stages of 

              spiritual development in our respective traditions. It is clear 

              that, as long as Anuttama Dasa and John Borelli call us together, 

              we Christians and Vaisnavas will find a way to celebrate further 

              steps of understanding together. Many thanks are due to Anuttama 

              and John for their leadership and to those ISKCON devotees who provided 

              the food. For the company and the beautiful location and the springtime 

              weather, we have to praise the Lord.</p>
