              Dasi<br>

            <p>I met Mahamaya Dasi in 1974, six months before she went to India 

              and began the adventures she describes in the second half of this, 

              her new book. We both worked at ISKCON Press, the publishing house 

              of the Hare Krsna movement, in Brooklyn, New York. Twenty-five years 

              later she asked me to be her literary 'back-seat driver' - to edit 

              two books she had written about her inspiring experiences in India: 

              a short diary called <i>Ganga Safari</i> and her new book, <i>Srila</i> 

              <i>Prabhupada Is Coming!</i></p>

            <p>Mahamaya lived in India more or less full-time from early 1975 

              to mid-1977. In those years, Srila Prabhupada, the founder-<i>acarya</i> 

              of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (and a world 

              traveller from 1965 to 1977), often stayed in India, especially 

              Mayapura, West Bengal - the upcoming world headquarters of the Hare 

              Krsna movement. Whenever he stayed in Mayapura, his sister visited 

              him for long periods. Mahamaya usually took care of 'Pisima' (meaning 

              'auntie' or 'the father's sister'), as she was known to the devotees 

              there. Mahamaya and Pisima often attended Srila Prabhupada's evening 

              meetings with devotees and guests. Mahamaya later travelled with 

              Srila Prabhupada and his disciples to Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Vrndavana 

              and Bombay. </p>

            <p>Mahamaya describes those two intense yet satisfying years in India 

              through more than a hundred detailed anecdotes. Readers familiar 

              with any books written by ladies of the British Raj in India will 

              probably find similarities between their stories of acculturation 

              and Mahamaya's.</p>

            <p><i>Srila Prabhupada Is Coming!</i> is the first memoir about Srila 

              Prabhupada published by one of his female disciples. (According 

              to Mahamaya, who manages the database of Srila Prabhupada's disciples, 

              only twenty-eight percent of these were women) Previously, biographies 

              about Srila Prabhupada were histories not 'her stories'. We now 

              have a rewarding book about him from the viewpoint of a woman in 

              the Hare Krsna movement, and Mahamaya's authentic accounts of the 

              early days of ISKCON will certainly have historical value.</p>

            <p>Women's issues in the Hare Krsna movement were less pronounced 

              in the 1970s than they are today; and Mahamaya provides a low-key 

              treatment of this subject, limiting her voice to that earlier time. 

              She also outlines some of the decisions and factors that defined 

              the Western devotee women's transformation into conservative Vedic 

              ladies and reveals how she personally aspired for cultured relationships, 

              becoming tired of 'being used by non-devotee men'.</p>

            <p>Mahamaya's book opens with a description of her early life - how 

              she grew up in a Jewish family in a New York suburb, did well in 

              school, started college, got married, became a hippie, and finally 

              left her husband in 1971 to join the Hare Krsna movement in Boston. 

              She writes this section as a regular narrative, not through anecdotes. 

              The pictures she presents of mundane American life can amuse.</p>

            <p>Once Mahamaya became a devotee, she encountered Srila Prabhupada. 

              She gained experience by serving in nine American temples and going 

              out on the Transcendental Road Show. After a failed marriage to 

              another devotee, she returned to New York (where I met her) and 

              from there went to India.</p>

            <p>Mahamaya's husband of twenty-two years, Jnanagamya Dasa, has written 

              the introduction to this book, and Nitya-trpta Dasi, a talented 

              photographer and graphic artist, has designed the covers, endpapers 

              and colour photo section, which includes two dozen pictures. </p>
