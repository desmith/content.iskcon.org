              at Fordham University (Ph.D., 1979) was a theological study of Kavikarnapura's 

              <i>Caitanya-candrodaya-natakam</i>, a ten-act drama devoted to the 

              life of Caitanya. Subsequent research treated the Gaudiya Vaisnava

              contemporary <i>rasa-lila </i>dramas in Vrndavana. Since 1983, Jerry 

              has been doing bibliographical research on Baba Premananda Bharati,

              a Krsna temple in Los Angeles in 1906. An article comparing the 

              arrival of Baba Bharati in the West with that of A.C. Bhaktivedanta 

              Swami Prabhupada was published in the Journal of Vaisnava Studies
