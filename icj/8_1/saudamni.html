            <h4><span class="maintextsubhead"><b>P</b></span><b><span class="maintextsubhead">resentation 
              by</span> <a href="biodata.html#saud" class="maintextsubhead">Saudamani 
              Dasi</a></b></h4>

            <p>There was a rumour going around that we ladies were in Mayapura 

              to present some feminist agenda. The idea was that, under the influence 

              of the modern women's rights movement or the theology which denies 

              the hierarchical nature of existence, we would plead with the GBC 

              to change the philosophy or adjust Srila Prabhupada's teachings 

              in order to fit in with the times. You can feel reassured that the 

              ladies here before you are among the most philosophically conservative 

              in our movement. Confronted with serious questions about the philosophy 

              Srila Prabhupada has given us, any one of them could give a very 

              satisfactory and strictly bona-fide explanation. The difficulty 

              is not in defending or explaining the philosophy, but rather in 

              trying to defend or explain our behaviour and, even more so, trying 

              to defend our policies, unofficial and official.</p>

            <p>Some of these ladies were among Srila Prabhupada's very first disciples. 

              They experienced Srila Prabhupada's personal interaction with women 

              first-hand, so you can be sure they were paying attention and asking 

              him pertinent questions. There is speculation that Srila Prabhupada 

              dealt with the ladies very liberally in the early days because he 

              was very kind and could see that they weren't up to a very high 

              standard; that the early examples of what Srila Prabhupada did or 

              said are irrelevant to his actual desire. The speculation is that 

              because of his kindness and mercy and out of necessity, Prabhupada 

              allowed ladies to do things he really didn't want them to do. </p>

            <p>As we know, Srila Prabhupada went to America to preach Krsna Consciousness 

              on the order of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. Srila Prabhupada 

              had the idea that he would present the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>to 

              the intellectual and political leaders of America and then eventually 

              the common people would follow. Srila Prabhupada was surprised to 

              find that the people who came forward and took an interest were 

              mostly from the counter-culture. He was perhaps even more surprised 

              to see that it wasn't just boys that were coming forward but girls 

              too. Rupanuga's wife, Kalindi, told me that Srila Prabhupada was 

              amazed to see that we drove cars. We should appreciate how naturally 

              Srila Prabhupada saw everything and everyone as coming from Krsna 

              and how as a pure devotee, he was able to engage everything and 

              everyone in Krsna's service. </p>

            <p>Srila Prabhupada was not ungrateful to Krsna for what he provided; 

              nor was he an atheist who saw who and what came as a matter of chance. 

              Because of Srila Prabhupada's purity and full surrender to executing 

              his spiritual master's order, he received instructions and guidance 

              directly from Krsna. Bhaktivinoda Thakura gave us the vision, Srila 

              Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati gave the order and Srila Prabhupada executed 

              that order. The early instructions and examples establishing principles 

              and strategies for spreading Krsna consciousness all over the world 

              are extremely important because they were coming directly from Lord 

              Caitanya to his pure devotee. As time went on, more and more was 

              left to his disciples. </p>

            <p>It is my contention that we should not portray Srila Prabhupada's 

              early personal mood, his preaching strategy, example and instructions 

              as some sort of compromise to necessity, while arrogantly thinking 

              that after a few years we became so advanced that we were able to 

              understand and improve upon the foundational instructions. When 

              Srila Prabhupada first came to Mayapura and asked Malati to give 

              class in front of his own Gaudiya Matha Godbrothers ('... and in 

              front of our Godbrothers with their big sticks, too,' as Malati 

              puts it.) Srila Prabhupada knew exactly what he was doing. Should 

              we think he was just being provocative for no purpose? It is a testament 

              to Srila Prabhupada's intense faith in the chanting of the holy 

              name that he left the awesome responsibility of spreading Krsna 

              consciousness in our incompetent hands. His faith was that the holy 

              name would purify us so that we would eventually follow his instructions 

              and example and that we too would receive instructions from Krsna. 

              It would be such a blessing to be united by the Supersoul, rather 

              than by e-mail.</p>

            <p> 

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Prajapati: In the early days of this movement, Srila Prabhupada, 

                in New York, devotees said they did not know how to treat Your 

                Divine Grace. They did not know your exalted position. I think 

                we are still very much offensive.</p>

              <p>Prabhupada: No, I am servant. I have no exalted position. Servant. 

                Caitanya Mahaprabhu sat down in a place where people were washing 

                their feet. Yes ... a representative of Krsna. I came to preach 

                Krsna consciousness, and Krsna has sent so many representatives 

                to help me. I consider like that. Without your help I could not 

                do. So I wanted Krsna's help, so Krsna has sent you. Therefore 

                you are representative of Krsna. That is my conception.<sup><a href="#1d">1</a></sup><a name="1"></a>
