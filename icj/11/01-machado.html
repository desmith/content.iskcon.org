<p><I>This paper is
based on a talk given by Monsignor Felix Machado of the Pontifical
Council for Interreligious Dialogue, the Vatican&rsquo;s central
office for the promotion of inter-religious dialogue, in
April 2004 at the annual ISKCON Communications Europe Leadership Team
meetings near Bergamo, Italy. In this paper Mons. Machado argues that
interfaith dialogue does not require difference be ignored for fear
of offending. Quite the opposite: he argues that difference must be
acknowledged and respected before proper inter-religious
understanding can take place, and that ignoring difference is more
likely to lead to a breakdown of relations between people of
different faiths. Here he examines some of the unique difficulties
and opportunities presented by Christian theology in interfaith
dialogue and how Christian doctrine regards the diversity of faith
that now pervades almost all societies. This paper and the talk it is
based on mark a significant development in ISKCON dialogue with other
faith traditions, a dialogue that was begun in earnest with the 1999
statement: ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in God.</I></p>

<p>The commitment of
the Catholic Church to interreligious dialogue is firm and
irreversible. Through the practice of interreligious dialogue the
Catholic Church wishes to cultivate sincere respect for other
religious traditions, their followers, and their beliefs. The
Catholic Church attempts to approach other religious traditions with
honesty and frankness. It also has its own understanding about what
precisely is meant by interreligious dialogue.</p>
<p>The call to dialogue
entails inherent limits. It is not an uncritical and ambiguous
engagement on the part of Catholic Christians, especially not in the
field of theology. In other words, the Catholic Church exhorts her<I>
</I>faithful to engage in dialogue with people of other religious
traditions while at the same time obliging them to adhere
uncompromisingly to the essential truths of Christian faith. The
Catholic Church has been trying, especially in these past forty
years, to incorporate the practice of interreligious dialogue in its
overall teaching.</p>
<p>The Catholic
faithful do not consider themselves to be on a higher level or better
than the believers of other religious traditions, such as Hindu
Vaisnavas.
I think hardly anyone in the Catholic Church today would really have
this attitude of superiority. The text of <I>Dominus Jesus</I>,<I> </I>an
important document from the Central Authority of the Catholic Church,
clearly states: &lsquo;Equality, which is a presupposition of
interreligious dialogue, refers to the equal personal dignity of the
parties in dialogue, not to<I> </I>doctrinal content, nor even less
to the position of Jesus Christ &mdash; who is God himself made man &mdash;
in relation to the founders of the other religions&rsquo; (<I>Dominus
Jesus, </I>n. 22).</p>
<p>I would like to
introduce here, with frankness and honesty, the fundamental faith of
the Catholic Church concerning the uniqueness of God. The respect I
have for the Vaisnava
religious tradition has brought me to write this. I write, in my
official capacity, with the knowledge of my colleagues in the
Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.</p>
<p>I would like here to
present the fundamental difference between the Catholic and Vaisnava
traditions. I am convinced that once we accept each other, and the
basic difference between our respective religious traditions, we will
see many paths open up to allow us to affirm our unity, which is
radical, fundamental, and decisive. &ldquo;There is only one divine
plan for every human being who comes into this world [cf. John 1:9],
one single origin and goal, whatever may be the colour of his skin,
the historical and geographical framework within which he happens to
live and act, or the culture in which he grows up and expresses
himself&rdquo; (John Paul II, n. 3). It is important to understand
the<I> </I>essential faith of the Catholic<I> </I>Church in order to
deepen our friendship.</p>
<p>The human being is the crown of God&rsquo;s
creation</p>
<p>A theology course I
teach, entitled &lsquo;Christian Anthropology&rsquo;, deals with the
basic question: &lsquo;Why does the Catholic Church value human life,
even to the point of clearly distinguishing the incomparable dignity
of human being life from the rest of creatures?&rsquo; The doctrine
of the Catholic Church begins by affirming that every human, male and
female, is created in the likeness and image of God. We as Catholic
Christians believe that the human being is the crown of God&rsquo;s
creation; that God did not create humans simply as one creature among
many other creatures. According to Gregory of Nyssa (<I>commentarius
in Canticum Canticorum</I>), the human person is all but the equal of
God (Dani&eacute;lou, pp. 162&ndash;3).</p>
<p>God is the creator
of everyone and everything. He did appoint the human person as
steward of His creation; but this<I> </I>can hardly be interpreted to
mean that the human being received absolute power to dominate and
rule indiscriminately over other creatures. That would mean the human
could replace God, the creator of heaven and earth. The Christian
tradition upholds the truth that God is always the creator of all
people and of every creature. This truth is reflected in the life of
St Francis of Assisi who, in his well-known &lsquo;Canticle to the
Sun&rsquo;, called the water<I> </I>his sister, the sun<I> </I>his
brother, and so forth. He treated everyone and everything as God&rsquo;s
creation. However, according to the Catholic faith, we must still
affirm that the human person is the crown of God&rsquo;s creation.
The human enjoys a singular place within the whole creation of God.</p>
<p><B>From faith in God
the Saviour...</B></p>
<p>The general method
in teaching theology is that we should first turn to the scriptures,
the divine revelation, the Bible. Meditating on the<I> </I>sacred
scriptures, and particularly the Old Testament, I am struck by the
fact that the first realisation of the people of Israel was: &lsquo;God
is with us and He saves us; even when beset by danger He never
abandons us&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;saving&rsquo;
for the Israelites did not mean some philosophical, dry, abstract
concept. Being &lsquo;saved&rsquo; by God<I> </I>was a concrete
experience for the people of God. They saw in that experience the
trans-historical act of God. This is why, to prove that<I> </I>God
exists, the Israelites narrated history in which God was revealed to
them as saviour-God. For example, the crossing of the Red Sea as
narrated in the Book of Exodus is not a myth, if we understand by
that word something a-historical or something that simply never took
place. Fundamental truth is conveyed through various episodes<I> </I>that
narrate the life of the ancient Israelites, namely, that the living
God was their unique saviour.</p>
<p>The Lord God saves
people who put their trust in Him. That is the conviction of the
Hebrew people. This<I> </I>conviction is based<I> </I>on<I> </I>the
revelation of God in history. When speaking of God they do not give
conceptual philosophical proofs for His existence; they simply
narrate their history<I>. </I>That is also how they transmit belief
in God to the new generations.</p>
<p>
	<p><B>4</B></p>
...to faith in God the Creator
</p>
<p>The first revealed
truth that the Israelites learnt about God was that He saved them.
But linked to that revealed truth was another question: &lsquo;Who is
this God who<I> </I>saves us?&rsquo; The Israelites are pushed to
deepen this question. They came to realise gradually that the God who
revealed Himself to them as their saviour was also their creator.</p>
<p>In the first book of
the Bible, the Book of Genesis, we learn that God created us and
everything that exists. There are two creation stories side-by-side
with the same message. On the first day, God creates light,
separating it from darkness, dividing day from night. On the second
day He creates heaven; on the third day He creates vegetation; on the
fourth day He creates the sun, moon and the stars; on the fifth day
God creates living creatures. On the sixth day God creates the human
being, male and female, in His own image and likeness. And on the
seventh day God had completed the work He had been doing. He rested
on the seventh day (Genesis<I> </I>1&ndash;2). The Book of Genesis
notes that at the end of each day of the creation &lsquo;God was
happy, He saw that it was good&rsquo;. But on the sixth day, when He
created the human person, Genesis<I> </I>distinctly records that not
only &lsquo;God saw it was good&rsquo;, but &lsquo;<I>indeed</I> it
was <I>very</I> good&rsquo; (Genesis 1:31, emphasis mine).</p>
<p>Although this story of the creation is
placed at the beginning of the first book of the Bible, it was not
necessarily how believers first became historically aware of this
truth. Chronologically, the people first learned from God&rsquo;s
revelation to them that He was their saviour, their liberator, the
one who set them free from the bondage of all their enemies. Later
when they were taken as captives to Babylon they learnt that the God
who saved them was also the God who created them.</p>
<p>As captives in the strange land of
Babylon the people of God felt cut off from their roots and out of
place. They hoped to return to the Promised Land that God had given
them. During the period of exile in Babylon they learnt a deeper
truth: The saviour of Israel is not only the creator of the
Israelites but He is also the creator of all the people around them
who belonged to the various religions of the time, and also of
everything that exists. The Book of Genesis teaches this fundamental
truth. I would like to draw attention to the point that God was
revealing Himself to the people He chose in order to make Himself
known among the nations of the world; He revealed Himself the unique
creator God as well as the saviour God of all people.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference: Jesus
Christ as the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s revelation</p>
<p>The third chapter of
the Book of<I> </I>Genesis speaks about the fall, the sin of the
human person. In spite of their sinfulness, God does not abandon His
people to the power of death. He has a plan to save them. The Bible
narrates the unfolding of this divine plan, which is finally
fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the
Virgin Mary, who suffered under Pontius Pilate, died, and on the
third day was raised from the dead. God saved the fallen human race
in, with, and through Jesus Christ who is the unique, complete, and
final revelation of God, not only of the Israelites but also of all
people upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p>This is the
fundamental difference between Christianity and all other religious
traditions: According to the faith of the Church, God&rsquo;s
revelation in history as the liberator of the Israelites and creator
of all is finally, completely, and fully concluded in Jesus Christ,
the incarnate Son of God. We observe that there is continuity in the
revelation of God in Jesus Christ but there is also a radical
(rupture) newness. Jesus Christ is seen to satisfy the hunger and
thirst for God, not only of the Israelites, but also of every person.</p>
<p>This revelation must be respected in
its integrity as it is the essential identity of the Church&rsquo;s
faith, which can also become the foundation, starting point, and
guiding principle for the Catholic Church&rsquo;s dialogue with
people of other religious traditions.</p>
<p>I am aware that
Vaisnavas
also aim to be devotees of God. The Church surely respects this.
However, in fidelity to the unique divine revelation that it has
received, and abiding in faith in a consistent and coherent manner,
the Church asks: &lsquo;Is the God you claim the same God whom Jesus
Christ revealed?&rsquo; Christianity is going to stay with this
question and this is going to define the fundamental and decisive
difference with other religions.</p>
<p>The faith of the
Church claims to know no other God than the one who is revealed
completely, definitively, and perfectly in Jesus Christ, who is the
unique saviour of all people. The Church admits that &mdash; without
any intention of being superior &mdash; her claim is, in a certain
sense, a judgement about the belief in God by people of other
religions. Jesus Christ is the complete and final truth of God; He is
the objective truth whom all people are obliged to seek and accept;
all other truth claims become relative to this unique and objective
truth, the mystery of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Relation of other religious traditions
to Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Christians cannot simply think: &lsquo;Just
as God is revealed in Jesus of Nazareth so also He is revealed
elsewhere&rsquo;. A Christian may speak of God&rsquo;s revelation
elsewhere, though not to the same degree as in Christ, the final and
complete revelation of God. Rooted in his faith, a Christian is
certain of the one true God who is the unique creator and saviour of
all people. However, the Church emphatically points out that the God
worshipped by people of other religions is understood differently and
worshipped differently by them. This, I would say, is the
fundamental, perhaps provocative, difference between Christianity and
other religious traditions. It is important to understand how
Christians hold firmly to this difference without renouncing their
commitment to engage and promote dialogue with other religious
traditions, because this God of Christian revelation is also the
merciful father of all; and in this all people can be necessarily
seen as related to Him and therefore related among themselves.</p>
<p>Ignored differences often result in
religious conflicts</p>
<p>How do people in various religions
appropriate difference? How do they deal with essential religious
differences? Does one&rsquo;s religious difference become a threat to
the other? These are the basic questions we need to ask. We can best
do this in dialogue.</p>
<p>The purpose of dialogue is not to
change or compromise the basic tenets of our respective religions,
but to arrive at a better and fair understanding of each other&rsquo;s
religions. We must accept that our religions are different from each
other. To ignore, forget, cancel, or compromise differences between
our religions would be irresponsible and may lead to false irenicism.
It would also be incoherent, inconsistent, and unfaithful to our
respective religious traditions.</p>
<p>Should difference
necessarily become a threat? Is it viewed as a threat by our partner
in dialogue? Further, is difference (ab)used by way of manipulation
of the other? Is difference something we can integrate into
understanding our own religion and that of the other? This last
relates somewhat to the approach of the Church, namely, to integrate
into its theology of religions this fundamental and decisive
difference with other religions so that it does not become a pretext
for an attitude of superiority, or an excuse to be closed in on
itself, or a reason to reject dialogue with people of other
religions. In presenting difference with other religions in dialogue
the Church sees an occasion for the possibility of a deeper
encounter.</p>
<p>Holding firmly to
its fundamental identity when in dialogue with other religious
traditions, and not searching for the lowest common denominator in
order to try and please others, the present-day Catholic theology of
religions is<I> </I>trying to help Christians attain a spirit of
respect and friendship towards people of all religions.</p>
<p>When differences are
ignored they can and do raise their heads in violent forms. A strong
image that comes to mind is 6 December 1992, when the Babri Masjid in
Ayodhya, North India, was torn down by Hindu fundamentalists, and
after that when Hindu temples were destroyed by Muslim extremists in
Bangladesh and Pakistan. In dialogue we need to talk about
differences. Differences must not be ignored, forgotten, hidden,
masked, or suspended as they will always raise their head after
hiding for a while.</p>
<p>With a very naive
understanding some people think that difference automatically creates
disharmony in society or blocks the path to peace. They then prefer
to close their eyes to the basic differences between religions. That
is not good. The<I> </I>ignorance of essential differences between
religions by their respective followers in the name of harmony and
peace can be identified as one<I> </I>of the main causes of religious
conflicts. Ignored differences raise their heads in violent forms. It
is necessary to acknowledge differences and deal with them.</p>
<p>Hinduism has always
had an accommodating and absorbing mentality. It accommodates and
absorbs different perspectives. For example, in the <I>&not;g-veda </I>we
read<I> </I>&lsquo;<I>ekam sat viparah bahuda vandanti</I>&rsquo;<I>
&mdash; </I>&lsquo;the Absolute is unity, which is seen in its
diversity by sages&rsquo; (<I>Rg-veda, </I>I.164,46). This view
seems to suggest the multi-faceted nature of truth; it suggests that
truth is one but it is seen in different ways by different wise
people. Based on this interpretation, the Hindu worldview
accommodates/assimilates differences between religions. For example,
Buddha is seen as an <I>avatara </I>of Visnu and Jesus Christ is
sometimes placed in the same shrine with others in the Hindu
pantheon.</p>
<p>Until now, in our
dialogues, we have not paid sufficient and careful attention to
essential differences between religions. Anxious to bring people of
various religions together we have rather preferred<I> </I>to ignore
or hide these basic differences. The result has often been a sudden
eruption of inexplicable and shocking violence. To ignore the
essential identity of a religion is to fail to know that religion.
This failure can lead to an attitude of compromise on the part<I> </I>of
the adherent, and can breed fear on the part of the partner in
dialogue. This fear, in turn, creates hatred, which finally shows up
in<I> </I>violent forms. In the absence of dialogue, frustrated
extremists use violence even in an organised manner. This is why I
strongly recommend a closer look at differences between religions
through dialogue in order to acknowledge them and respect them. It is
important that Hindus try to understand Christians in the integrity
of the Church&rsquo;s faith just as Christians should try to
understand Hindus and respect them in the integrity of their
religious beliefs.</p>
<p>I would propose four interpretations of
violence that are directly linked to religions:</p>
<OL>
	<LI><p>Violence erupts
	when relationships are avoided with the excuse of the other being
	different from me. We need to be in relationships with one another.
	We avoid relating to the other because we are afraid of each other,
	because the other is different from me. (Violence also breaks out
	when religious believers choose to live in ignorance of their own
	religion as well as that of the other.)</p>
	<LI><p>In many parts of the world
	violence is the result of the politicisation of religion for vested
	interests.</p>
</OL>
<OL START=3>
	<LI><p>Violence can explode because of
	different understandings of secularism. Religious believers are
	grappling with the question of how to deal with increasing
	secularism that often encourages marginalisation of religion in
	society or induces an attitude of indifference towards religions.</p>
	<LI><p>Violence may flare up due to the
	changing/evolving understanding of the role of religion in society.</p>
</OL>
<p>Is religious pluralism a problem to
Christianity?</p>
<p>For Christianity,
religious pluralism does pose a problem in a certain sense. Why?
Because no other religion proclaims itself so absolutely as &lsquo;the&rsquo;<I>
</I>religion, the one and only valid revelation of the one living
God. Thus Christianity obviously considers its basic identity in
relation to other religions as being&nbsp;of significant importance.
Christianity gives serious attention to the difference between
religions lest people begin to think that one religion is as good as
another.</p>
<p>This is the
fundamental question that Christians pose: &lsquo;If we believe in
one God who perfectly, finally, and completely revealed Himself in
Jesus Christ, then how can there be others who can claim to worship
God other than the one whom Jesus Christ<I> </I>revealed?&rsquo;
Thus, in a certain sense, religious pluralism does become the
greatest<I> </I>scandal when seen from the point of view of the
Church&rsquo;s faith. This perceived problem can be intensified for
individual Christians in today&rsquo;s world as we are surrounded
also by relativistic ideas from within as well as from outside of
Christianity.</p>
<p>It could be roughly
stated that, in the past, it was understood that Europe had its
religion, Christianity; India had its religion, Hinduism; Thailand
had its religion, Buddhism; and so on. Culture and religion were
uncritically linked. An individual Christian in Europe thus felt
safe, for he thought: &lsquo;Hindus live in India, far away&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;Buddhists live in Thailand, also far away&rsquo;. Hindus in
India would do the same: &lsquo;Christians live over there in
Europe&rsquo;. However, our societies are becoming increasingly
multi-religious. Very little attention has been paid by respective
religious traditions to teach their followers to deal with the new
situations created by religious pluralism. Individual believers often
feel threatened by the presence of the followers of other religions.
An exclusively Christian Europe, for example, does not exist today.
Men and women with their different religious beliefs are becoming
neighbours. Modern Catholic theology is grappling with questions
posed by this religious pluralism. When fundamental differences are
not integrated into the coherent theological visions and systems of
different religious traditions there obviously come about many
misunderstandings that give rise to prejudices, hatred, and finally
end in violence and killing in the name of religion.</p>
<p>Attempts by Christians to understand
others</p>
<p>Catholic theologians
have been reflecting on the fact of religious pluralism in order to
integrate the spirit of respect and friendship towards other
religious traditions while remaining coherent with the integrity of
the Church&rsquo;s faith. One of them, for example, noted in rather
categorical language: &lsquo;Religious pluralism poses for
Christianity a greater threat and grounds for greater anxiety than
for all other religions. For no other religion, not even Islam,
proclaims itself so absolutely as <I>the </I>religion; Christianity
is the one and only valid revelation of the one living God&rsquo;. He
further observed: &lsquo;Christianity conceives of itself as the
absolute religion determined for all humankind, as a religion that
can recognise no other as having equal rights alongside itself&rsquo;
(Rahner, 1962).</p>
<p>An urgent need is
being felt today to re-articulate, with the help of the positive
experiences of dialogue among religions, the basic difference between
Christianity and other religions in order to arrive at a more exact
understanding of the identity of a Christian in a religiously
pluralistic world. The Church&rsquo;s faith in the revealed mystery
of God, on the one hand, and a genuine search for the mystery of God
by the people of other religions<a name="1b"></a><SUP><a href="#1">1</a></SUP>, on the other hand, can
be seen to be related. This possible relation can become the basis
for Christians to enter deeper into dialogue with people of other
religions. Christianity identifies itself with the revealed mystery
of God in Jesus Christ, the unique mediator between God and the human
person. Can we then say that the authentic search for God in other
religious traditions is ultimately related to Jesus Christ as He
alone can satisfy the hunger and thirst of every person for God?</p>
<p>The fundamental question remains: Are
we Christians and people of various religions really talking of the
same God? Obviously we would all agree that there cannot be more than
one God. But who is the true God? The Christians firmly believe that
He is revealed as the Trinitarian God. Logically then there should
have been only one religion. The fact is that there are many
religions. Christianity is struggling to come to terms with this
enigma, not by abandoning or compromising the Church&rsquo;s faith,
but by trying to integrate into its coherent theological vision the
religious search for God by people of other religious traditions,
pointing out to them that their search can be fulfilled in Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s offer of
salvation extends to all humanity. This means that God makes His
grace available to all people so that all people come to know Him in
His fullness. God&rsquo;s grace cannot be reserved only for a few.
Since God wants to save all people, all must also find access to Him.
It cannot be the privilege of a few. I would summarise this
reflection in three points: (1) all people are called to salvation,
(2) all salvation is in Christ as there is no salvation outside
Christ. Therefore, (3) all people who seek God sincerely can be
related to the mystery of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Why does the Church,
especially the Catholic Church, promote dialogue among religions? How
do Catholics remain open to the followers of other religious
traditions while at the same time holding firm to their essential
identity, the faith of the Church? By holding firmly to her essential
faith, namely, that there is no God outside the one revealed in Jesus
Christ, the Catholic Church wishes to be respected for its faith.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church can never impose
her faith on others; the Canon Law of the Catholic Church stipulates
that &lsquo;It is never lawful to induce men by force to embrace the
Catholic faith against their conscience&rsquo; (Canon 74.8 &sect;2),
although she must always propose it to all.</p>
<p>Every religion has
its own way of understanding itself. The reason people of different
religions must come together in dialogue is primarily to have every
religious tradition mutually respected in its integrity. Just as I am
not going to tell devotees of Krsna
how or what to believe, so I expect that they also will not tell me,
a Christian, how or what to believe. Of course,<I> </I>I do not mean
to reduce the entire<I> </I>exercise of interreligious dialogue to
just allowing me to live my faith and letting you live yours.
Interreligious dialogue is more than that. However, it is fundamental
to respect essential differences between our religions without making
these differences obstacles in the path of respectful and friendly
relationships.</p>
<p><B>Essential
differences among religions: Recognise, identify, and respect </B></p>
<p>Dialogue among
religions can often take place because of essential differences.
Therefore we should not try to do away with essential differences by
ignoring them or by trying to cancel them and thus engage in facile
compromise. In order for our dialogue to become effective and
fruitful we need to identify essential differences, acknowledge them,
and respect them; and when it comes to respecting other religions let
it be an exercise worthy of its name. That is the conviction of the
Catholic Church, particularly since the Second Vatican Council. Lest
there be an attitude of indifferentism in our respect for
differences, all partners in dialogue should relentlessly seek the
truth that is the common destiny of all.</p>
<p>In the
administration of the Catholic Church, on the universal level, one
office, or department, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of
Peoples, looks after the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; but
there is also an office, or department, the Pontifical Council for
Interreligious Dialogue (PCID), for dialogue with people of other
religions. The respective competences of these two offices are well
defined. The Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples promotes
the spread and deepening of the Christian faith, a duty of every
single Christian as well as of the whole Church. This is carried out,
in principle, without imposing the Church&rsquo;s faith on anyone.
The PCID works to &lsquo;promote adequate studies (on various
religious traditions) and to favour friendly relations of the Church
with the followers of other religions. The Council is linked, for
doctrinal and practical aspects, to the Second Vatican Council&rsquo;s
<I>Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian
Religions, Nostra Aetate</I>. The Apostolic Constitution, <I>Pastor
Bonus</I>, of John Paul II (28 June 1988) on the Roman Curia,
assigned to the Council the competence to favour and regulate
relations with members and groups of other religions which are not
included under any Christian denomination, and also with people who
are, in whatever manner, endowed with a religious sense&rsquo;
(<I>Annuario Pontificio 2004</I>, p. 1722).</p>
<p>A Hindu can say to a
Christian, &lsquo;thank you very much, I have listened to you
proposing to me the Catholic faith; but I am a Hindu and would
happily like to remain a Hindu&rsquo;. This answer is perfectly
legitimate and must be respected. Catholics do not shy away from
relating to Hindus who wish to remain Hindus, knowing well that they
may never become Christians, for Christians must relate with people
of all religions at all times and in every place. Similarly, if a
Muslim says, &lsquo;I want to remain a Muslim&rsquo;, a Catholic does
not turn around and say, &lsquo;Ah, I thought you were going<I> </I>to
become a Christian, that is why I came to propose to you the
Christian faith; but now that you do not wish to<I> </I>become
Christian I will have nothing to do with you&rsquo;. No, I, as a<I>
</I>Catholic, must still relate with that Muslim. Catholics wish to
become friends even of those who declare their firm adherence to
their respective religions. That is why there is, in the Vatican,
besides the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, the
Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. That you are
different does not prevent me, a Christian, in any way from relating
to you, a Hindu, and becoming your friend. I hope it is also true
vice-versa. As Hindus you are different from me and I respect you. As
Hindus you see me different from you and I appeal to you to respect
me in my difference without asking me to change what I must and must
not believe as a Catholic Christian.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church recommends and
encourages its faithful to study other religions, while at the same
time exhorting them to deepen their own faith. Such an exercise
allows Christians to accurately identify differences among religions,
gladly acknowledge them, and humbly respect them in order to grow in
genuine friendship with people across religious boundaries.</p>
<p>The God in whom
Christians believe as the God of all is certainly not the exclusive
God of Christians alone. His revelation in history is for all people;
all seek Him, for only He can satisfy, beyond every expectation, the
hunger and thirst of every human heart. It is interesting to listen
to St Paul who, after coming to know the religion of the Athenians,
declares to them the fundamental difference of Christianity while at
the same time drawing their attention to the relation their search
for God had with Jesus Christ. St Luke, the author of the Acts of the
Apostles,<I> </I>reports St Paul&rsquo;s speech to the Athenians:</p>
<p>Men of Athens, I have seen for myself
how extremely scrupulous you are in all religious matters, because,
as I strolled round looking at your sacred mountains, I noticed among
other things an altar inscribed: To an unknown God. In fact, the
unknown God you revere is the one I proclaim to you.</p>
<p>Since the God who
made the world and everything in it is Himself Lord of heaven<I> </I>and
earth, He does not make His home in shrines made by human hands. Nor
is He in need of anything, that He should be served by human hands;
on the contrary, it is He who gives everything &mdash; including life
and breadth &mdash; to everyone. From one single principle He not
only created the whole human race so that they could occupy the
entire earth, but He decreed the times and limits of their
habitation. And He did this so that they might seek the deity and, by
feeling their way towards Him, succeed in finding Him; and indeed He
is not far from any of us, since it is in Him that we live, and move,
and exist, as indeed some of your own writers have said: We are all
His children.</p>
<p>Since we are the children of God, we
have no excuse for thinking that the deity looks like anything in
gold, silver, or stone that has been carved and designed by a man.</p>
<p>But now, overlooking
the times of ignorance, God is telling everyone everywhere that they
must repent, because He has fixed a day when the whole world will be
judged in uprightness by a man He has appointed. And God has publicly
proved this by raising Him from the dead. (Acts<I> </I>17:23&ndash;31)</p>
<p>Dialogue with religions and the mystery
of the Blessed Trinity</p>
<p>Christians believe
in one God who is Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is
tri-unity, community, family. God is not an isolated monad, He is one
God in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy<I> </I>Spirit.
I find it easier to explain this to Hindus than to people of other
religious traditions. My ancestors were Hindus and part of my distant
family is still practising Hinduism. Although we, of two different
religions, are not speaking of the same thing it is not very<I>
</I>difficult for Hindus to understand me if I speak of the
Trinitarian mystery of God; it is a pluralistic mystery rather than a
mystery of God which is pure monism.</p>
<p>God the Father</p>
<p>Christianity gives
fundamental value to love. God can&rsquo;t be a loving God if He is a
pure monad which, as closed-in upon itself, would be just loving
itself &mdash; a form of pure egoism. Jesus Christ reveals God as the
loving<I> </I>merciful Father: &lsquo;God is love&rsquo; (1 John
4:8). When God is invoked as a loving Father, He is certainly the
Father of all. Here &lsquo;all&rsquo; should mean &lsquo;all without
exclusion&rsquo;. If He is the Father of all, then He is the single
origin and the single destiny of all people. In that then, despite
the difference, He is the authentic and<I> </I>objective goal of
search of<I> </I>all people for God<I>.</I> In your<I> </I>search for
the true God I see you related to Him and therefore, related to me, a
Christian believer. Christians cannot negate this fundamental
relationship. Therefore, dialogue with other religions becomes
indispensable for all Christian believers.</p>
<p>God the Son</p>
<p>When Christians
proclaim God the Son, Jesus Christ, as God made visible, they witness
to the unique mediator between God and the human person. He is true
God and true man, the God-man. He is the eternal Word of the Father.
&lsquo;He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things came
into being, not one thing came into being except through Him&rsquo;
(John l:2&ndash;3). Jesus Christ is the incarnate God. Only in Him is
God fully, perfectly, and finally revealed. Christians thus believe
that Jesus Christ did not assume a body of merely a single individual
belonging to a nation, a<I> </I>race, or a<I> </I>religion, but He
assumed in His incarnation entire humanity. In other words, the
mystery of His incarnation saved every human person and therefore He
cannot be limited to a particular people, race, or religion. In this
He united himself with every human being. Jesus Christ is God
mingling with humanity. In His incarnation Jesus Christ is united
with all; in His person He fulfils all search for true God. Can a
Christian then think: &lsquo;I have nothing to do with people of
other religious traditions?&rsquo; On the contrary, Christians have
everything to do with everybody, without exception, because they
profess their faith in the mystery of Jesus Christ, the Lord and
saviour of all.</p>
<p>As the second person of the Blessed
Trinity, Jesus Christ is also referred to as the &lsquo;Word made
flesh&rsquo;. The creator God has sown the &lsquo;seeds of the Word&rsquo;
in every culture and religion (everything is created through Him,
with Him, and in Him). Consequently, He is the source of all
goodness, truth, and holiness which may be found in every culture and
religion. The Church urges Christians to discover the &lsquo;seeds of
the Word&rsquo;, the hidden treasure, everywhere.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the
unique saviour of all. He redeems all from sin and gives everyone
fullness of life. Christians celebrate the feast of Easter as the
final liberation that Jesus Christ brought to all. Jesus Christ
completed the definitive liberation of every person by shedding His
own blood, by willingly offering His own life. Jesus did this not
only for people of a particular religion or race but He did it for
all. Recognising this truth, Christians are obliged to build deep
relationships with everybody.</p>
<p>God the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>The third person of
the Blessed Trinity is the Holy Spirit. The Heavenly Father sent His
Son into the world out of love. God wants all people to be saved.
Upon accomplishing the mission entrusted to Him, the Son returns to
the Father but without leaving us orphans, as it were. We are
animated from within because we are accompanied by the Holy Spirit.
He has no confines or boundaries. He is God ever present in our
midst. We who are baptised in Him are always to follow God and not
make God follow us, as we often tend to do. The Holy Spirit, it is
clearly said in the sacred scriptures, is like wind; it blows where
it wills. We are to follow wherever He precedes us. The Catholic
bishops in India once wrote: &lsquo;Other religions are not walls to
be brought down; they are temples of the Holy Spirit whom we have
failed to visit&rsquo;<SUP><a name="2b"></a><a href="#2">2</a></SUP>.</p>
<p>Dialogue with other
religions is an obligatory path for Christians because the presence
of God through the Holy Spirit is limitless and without confines. God
is present everywhere through the promise of the Holy Spirit. We
believe that He is present in a special and in particular way in the
Catholic Church because that is the explicit promise of Jesus Christ
before he ascends to the Father; that does not mean the Holy Spirit
is not present in other places and people. He is giver of all gifts,
light of all hearts; He is the perfect consoler; in fatigue and
tiredness He is our rest, in sorrow He is our comfort; without Him
there is nothing authentic in any of us. He is the<I> </I>bond of
unity among us<I>. </I>We like to say that the Holy Spirit is the<I>
</I>patron of our dialogue with other religions.</p>
<p>I would like here to
reiterate the irreversible option of the Catholic Church to dialogue<I>
</I>with people of<I> </I>all religious traditions.</p>
<p>A history of the Church&rsquo;s
dialogue with other religions</p>
<p>We can roughly
divide the history of Christianity and its dialogue with other
religions into four<I> </I>stages.</p>
<p>In its earliest
period,<I> </I>nascent Christianity was influenced by other religious
traditions. In imitation of the mystery of the incarnation, &lsquo;the
young Churches, rooted in Christ and built up on the foundation of
the Apostles, take to themselves in a wonderful exchange all the
riches of the nations which were given to Christ as an inheritance
(cf. Psalms<I> </I>2:8). They borrow from the customs and traditions
of their people, from their wisdom and their learning, from their
arts and disciplines, all those things which can contribute to the
glory of their Creator, or enhance the grace of their Savior, or
dispose Christian life the way it should be&rsquo; (<I>Ad Gentes</I>,
22).<I> </I>The early fathers of the Church, while affirming the
unique, original, and singular character of Christianity, presented
the Christ-event as the fulfilment of the ancient quest for the
absolute.</p>
<p>In the next stage
Christians became more occupied with safeguarding the uniqueness of
the Christian faith in the context of heresies of their time. Other
religions were completely ignored, or their role in the life of their
adherents was underestimated. Christianity is accused of exclusivism
as it is seen to be acting in a way that seemed superior and
triumphalistic. However, one cannot overlook the danger with which
Christianity was threatened in this period. The struggle with inner
heresies that endangered the purity of Christian faith meant that
differences were considered threats.</p>
<p>With the dawn of colonialism, which
brought the Christians of Europe into more direct contact with other
cultures and religions, and following the period of illumination in
Europe, there began the stage of serious study of other religions and
their comparison with Christianity. As a result of this study,
discussion and debate emerged about other religious beliefs and the
place of the followers of other religions in God&rsquo;s plan of
salvation.</p>
<p>Finally, a radical change of attitude
took place. Today the Catholic Church wants to approach other
religious traditions with sensitivity to the spiritual and human
values enshrined in them. Religions command respect because they bear
witness to efforts to find answers to the profound mysteries of the
human condition and give expression to the experience and longings of
millions of their adherents. Other religions are not considered mere
objects of Christian mission but partners in dialogue.</p>
<p>The Church&rsquo;s dialogue is founded
on the content of its faith</p>
<p>Hindus and Christians today must deepen
their mutual respect and friendship, not by ignoring the essential
differences that exist between the two religious traditions, but
rather by understanding, acknowledging, and accepting them, and thus
mutually respecting them. In Hindu-Christian dialogue there is a
tendency to dwell on apparent analogies or similarities, the result
of which is often facile irenicism. Let me share with you three
examples:</p>
<p>The symbol of food:
In the Vedic tradition food is sometimes said to be a sacred symbol.
The <I>&not;g-veda</I> teaches that food is life. I quote from the
<I>Taittiriya Upani</I><I>s</I><I>ad</I>:<I>
</I>&lsquo;From food indeed are creatures born. All living
things that dwell on earth, by food in truth do they live and into it
they finally pass. For truly food is the first of all beings and
therefore it is called the universal remedy. Those who worship
Brahman as food, assuredly obtain all the food they need. From food
are all things born; by food when they are born they grow and
develop. Food is eaten by beings and itself eats beings; because of
that its name is food&rsquo; (III, 1&ndash;2; 6&ndash;10).</p>
<p>For me, as a Christian, this example is
very attractive, and it is a tempting proposition to indulge in a
comparison with a similar symbol and draw a hasty conclusion by
simply putting some verses from the New Testament alongside the above
Hindu texts. But here is where I must firmly hold to the essential
identity. The rest follows from the content, the essential
difference, which I have tried to elaborate in the preceding pages.
The verses from the New Testament of the Bible sometimes placed
alongside the Hindu texts are the following:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the
bread of life. He who comes to me shall not hunger and he who
believes in me shall never thirst. This is the bread which comes down
from heaven that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living
bread that comes down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he
will live forever and the bread which I shall give for the life of
the world is my flesh&rsquo; (John 6:35, 50&ndash;1). Jesus Christ
publicly declared himself the bread of life.</p>
<p>In Hinduism food is
sometimes used&nbsp;as a symbol of absolute reality and in
Christianity Jesus Christ is the bread of life. Although there is a
striking similarity in the expression of symbols, for me as
Christian, Jesus Christ who declares himself food is the unique,
complete, perfect, and final revelation of the one and true God.
There<I> </I>is no God outside Him. Only He is eternal food, the
bread that has come down from<I> </I>heaven. This is the fundamental
difference between our two religions. Since we do not begin from the
same premise we cannot draw one conclusion that is valid for both
religions as if they were parallel ways of salvation.</p>
<p>The same things may
be spoken of in various religions in different ways. But that cannot
become a pretext<I> </I>for Christians to ignore or to relativise the
essential faith of the Church. There is a fundamental identity in the
very content of the Christian faith that should always remain the
norm and the criterion, especially for Christians, in all comparison.</p>

<p>Let us take another
example. The <I>Bhagavad-gita </I>in chapter four (vv. 7&ndash;8)
speaks about <I>avatara. </I>It is said: &lsquo;For whenever the law
of righteousness withers away and lawlessness arises then I generate
myself on earth for the protection of the good, for the destruction
of evildoers, for the setting up of the law of righteousness, I come
into being age after age&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The mystery of the &lsquo;Word of God
becoming flesh&rsquo; in Christianity is of paramount importance. St
John the evangelist introduces the mystery of the incarnation of
Jesus with these words: &lsquo;In the beginning was the word and the
word was with God and the word was God. He was in the beginning with
God; all things were made through Him and without Him was not
anything made that was made. In Him was life and the life was the
light of man. The true light that enlightens every man was coming
into the world. He was in the world and the world was made through
Him and yet the world knew Him not&rsquo; (John 1:1&ndash;5, 9&ndash;12,
14).</p>
<p>Again, the tempting proposition is to
put the two quotations alongside and indulge in drawing hasty
conclusions. I repeat, the premise is not the same, therefore the
conclusion cannot be the same. The content, namely Jesus Christ who
&lsquo;becomes man&rsquo; is the unique, complete, and decisive
revelation of one and true God.</p>
<p>My third example is
about the respective call to conversion according to our two
religions. I would stand by the distinction which is made in India
between <I>dharma-parivartan </I>(conversion to God) and
<I>dharma-antara </I>(change from one religion to another).
<I>Dharma-parivartan </I>is understood as the ongoing conversion that
each person is called on to undergo, no matter which religion,
including Christianity. God forbid that any of us think that we have
arrived at our final destiny, namely, union with God. All of us have
a long way to go to achieve our union with God. Therefore there is a
constant need, daily, at every moment, for everyone for conversion.
This is <I>dharma-parivartan.</I></p>
<p>The whole <I>sadhana</I>
(practice) of the Hindu way of life is considered an ongoing
conversion. A Hindu may try to gradually become aware of the
<I>satyasa-satyam</I> (the truth of truth) by abandoning all illusion
(<I>maya</I>)<I> </I>and thus finally attain liberation.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi
coined another word, with a new meaning, namely, <I>dharma-antara,
</I>change from one religion to another. In Christianity,
<I>dharma-parivartan </I>and <I>dharma-antara </I>are considered
distinct but related to each other. One&rsquo;s real conversion is to
God, who has revealed Himself in Jesus Christ who cannot be separated
from the Church, which is His body. One&rsquo;s daily conversion to
God and consequently the conversion from another religion to Jesus
Christ are seen as intrinsically related.</p>
<p>Obviously,
Christianity builds its teaching on the faith of the Church.<I> </I>One
cannot pretend to be a Christian when one ignores or attempts to
relativise the faith of the Church on which the whole edifice of
Catholic religion stands. The Church&rsquo;s faith is the content,
the basic identity, of every Christian who must uncompromisingly
adhere to it and live it in this religiously pluralistic world.
Christians can certainly<I> </I>not impose their faith on others
although they must always propose it to everyone. But Christians must
also respect others in their religious otherness.</p>
<p>What kind of relationship is the
Catholic Church looking for?</p>
<p>Theological
relationship between religions can be quite problematic. However, our
common spiritual sensitivities can become the basis for our
relationships. The relationship that Christianity is looking for is a
deep friendship among religious believers. We must build trust and
confidence in each other. The first duty of the human being is to
respond to God who loves us; God is the supreme value in life (<I>summum
bonum</I>). Christians are motivated to go to others in<I> </I>response
to God who loves us. This response may take the concrete forms of
service such as dialogue or inculturation. The God of Christians is
the God of all. In Him we are all related. The comprehensive Hindu
tradition has sought God relentlessly. Jesus Christ, we believe,
fulfils that search. Because of the openness of Hindus to the mystery
of God, Hindu-Christian dialogue can become a model of dialogue also
for other<I> </I>religious traditions.</p>
