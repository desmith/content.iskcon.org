<p>I write this review from two
perspectives. First, I am an insider to the movement that is the
subject of this book: I grew up in the Hare Krsna movement, and three
generations of my family are committed members of ISKCON, or the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Together we have
participated in ISKCON&rsquo;s activities in both India and the
United States, from the early 1970s to the present day. Second, I
write as an academic who specialises in the study of Hinduism.</p>
<p><I>The
Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious
Transplant</I> is a collection of 25 articles on ISKCON and its
institutional offshoots as they have developed since the passing away
of ISKCON&rsquo;s founder, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The
book is divided into six coherent sections, addressing the movement&rsquo;s
theological background, history, controversies about lineage,
heresies, social issues, and members&rsquo; reevaluations.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noticeable feature of
the book&rsquo;s composition is its authorship. Nearly all the
authors (and the editors of the volume) hold or have held a personal
commitment to the movement. Many are forthcoming about their
associations, while others are not. The selection of pieces is
generally balanced between current and ex-members of the movement.
The contributions of so many insiders make the book an interesting
study of the insider/outsider issues that have elicited much recent
interest in academia. Can a religious practitioner also be a scholar
of his tradition? On the other hand, does a non-practicing scholar
truly have access to the tradition he studies? Several of the authors
explicitly raise these issues (e.g., Vishnu), while others provide
good examples of insider scholarship (e.g., W. Deadwyler).</p>
<p>While it is convenient for readers to
find a diverse range of perspectives within a single volume, little
of this scholarship is fresh or original. Much of the material,
information, and analysis has been around for years, and it will be
quite familiar to anyone who has followed the movement&rsquo;s course
over the past decade. This will be especially true for readers who
are insiders to the movement&mdash;the essays on each topic,
excluding the purely historical essays, are written by the usual
proponents of a particular viewpoint, using material that has
repeatedly surfaced in the recent past. (A few articles stand out as
noteworthy or even brilliant exceptions, such as those by Kenneth
Valpey and Thomas Herzig.) A direct consequence of this lack of
originality is that the volume offers a very narrow window on the
Hare Krsna movement.</p>
<p>This limitation is recognisable in
several areas:</p>
<p>(1) Geography. Some of the most
significant recent developments in ISKCON, and certainly much of its
expansion, have taken place in Eastern Europe, Russia, and India.
These areas have been loci for social change, doctrinal debates, and
institutional controversies of the type discussed in the book. Even
for the movement in the United States, these regions have become
sources of influence that are no longer easy to ignore, as does this
volume.</p>
<p>(2)
Demographics. One of the most important catalysts for change in the
Hare Krsna movement in the last two decades has been its shifting
demographics. Devotees have moved from communes to congregations and
have shifted from being single to supporting households. Temples
themselves are often populated by priests imported from distant parts
of the world. Congregational families increasingly find spiritual
support in small gatherings and worship-groups, rather than large,
centralised temples. The movement is experiencing the ageing of its
membership, accompanied by a shift in pastoral care priorities. The
movement has now seen the arrival of two generations of devotees for
whom Hare Krsna is their family religion. This has led to attempts at
creating viable educational alternatives, including home-schooling,
Sunday schools, and institutions of higher education such as
Bhaktivedanta College, in Belgium. Perhaps the single most powerful
element that has kept ISKCON afloat in its post-charismatic phase has
been the consistent support of the Indian community in the diaspora.
Many temples in the USA are now populated, managed, and funded by
local Indian communities. <I>The Hare Krishna Movement</I> takes only
passing notice of some of these demographic changes, succumbing
instead to a &lsquo;catalogue of controversies&rsquo; approach to
historical documentation.</p>
<p>(3) Time frame. As a consequence of
ignoring recent demographic changes, the book has a relatively
limited time frame. Despite its stated aim of addressing the &lsquo;fate&rsquo;
of the Hare Krsna movement, the volume has very little to say about
the movement&rsquo;s present or future. It focuses primarily on a
series of debates from a decade ago, privileging the concerns of a
specific generation of members. I found in the book little
description of the ISKCON I have known as a second-generation Indian
in America. My experience of the movement is far from unique; indeed,
it is the experience of a significant section of the membership in
countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and India. This
limited time frame, one could argue, is embedded in the title of the
book. &lsquo;Fate&rsquo; is a forward-looking word applied to an
entity with no future. It suggests a future that is doomed or, at
best, predestined to decline. Indeed, in their concluding words, the
editors consider the possibility of writing &lsquo;ISKCON&rsquo;s
epitaph&rsquo;, but fortunately dismiss the idea as &lsquo;premature&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Despite
<I>The</I> <I>Hare Krishna Movement&rsquo;s</I> virtues as an honest
appraisal of institutional turmoil after 1977, and the presence of
passionate articles from a diversity of viewpoints, the book is
unlikely to be widely appreciated in ISKCON or its institutional
offshoots for a simple reason: Two articles, written by the same
author, attack the movement&rsquo;s founder&sbquo; Prabhupada,  in a
manner that many members may find to be uninformed and offensive.
Even persons disaffected by ISKCON&mdash;this includes some advocates
of every viewpoint voiced in the volume&mdash;maintain an attachment
to the movement&rsquo;s founder and some conviction in his integrity
as an individual and a spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Ekkehard
Lorenz&rsquo;s essays on Prabhupada attempt to depict him as racist,
sexist, intellectually dishonest, ungrateful, unethical,
unsophisticated, and unaware of the norms of the societies in which
he lived. His teachings are blamed for condoning abuse of children,
abuse of women, and abuse by leadership, while promoting
dictatorship, intolerance, and autocratic rule by the guru. Lorenz&rsquo;s
articles betray a lack of scholarly method and analysis. To make his
points, Lorenz simply quotes Prabhupada out of context and then
interprets his statements with no regard to Caitanya Vaisnava
theology, the social contexts in which Prabhupada lived, or
Prabhupada&rsquo;s own application of his teachings. A
straightforward example: Lorenz produces a selection of statements by
Prabhupada on the role and status of women; then he draws his
conclusion without giving thought to traditional Hindu views on
women, the understanding of women in Caitanya Vaisnavism, or
Prabhupada&rsquo;s significant reforms and innovations in this regard
(offering women <I>brahmana</I> initiation, the opportunity to
perform worship on the altar, leadership roles in missionary
activity, and so on). Such contextualised analysis would, of course,
greatly complicate Lorenz&rsquo;s project of portraying Prabhupada as
sexist.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, the editors admit
Lorenz&rsquo;s lack of attention to context, but they sidestep the
difficulty by saying that &lsquo;contextualisation immediately
problematises simplistic notions of the absolute nature of the guru&rsquo;
(p. 439). I see no good reason, however, for an academic volume to
fear such problematisation, especially when the alternative is
simplistic criticism.</p>
<p>Overall,
<I>The Hare Krishna Movement</I> will prove useful to scholars of
religion as a glimpse into the struggles of a religious tradition
taking root in foreign soil. For members of the Hare Krsna movement,
the book can serve as a useful tool for historical reflection and
self-assessment, for it assembles material from diverse perspectives
within the pages of a single volume. As there have been few studies
of the Hare Krsna movement in the last decade, this book is a
noteworthy contribution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the reasons given in
this review&mdash;lack of originality, the dated nature of the
discussion, and insufficient attention to context, especially recent
social changes&mdash;it appears that the book as a whole offers a
rather limited perspective on the Hare Krsna movement. This is
unfortunate, for the notion of &lsquo;transplant&rsquo; entails more
than just the transport of an object from one location to another.
Success in transplanting depends as much on the conditions of the new
environment as it does on having a healthy and vigorous specimen. The
arrival of a plant in a new landscape means that the landscape will
be changed, but it also requires that the plant adapt in response to
its new environment. Understanding this interaction, therefore,
becomes indispensable for ensuring a verdant future.</p>
<p>Indeed, a contextualised analysis of
the Hare Krsna movement&mdash;one that addresses recent developments
within the movement along with issues of integration into new
environments&mdash;would be of great value to all those interested in
studying the migration of Indian traditions to the West.</p>
