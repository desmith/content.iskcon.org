<p>Monsignor
Machado&rsquo;s elegant and erudite paper &lsquo;Dealing with
Difference: A Catholic Point of View&rsquo; constitutes an important
corrective to the tendency towards the adoption of a false or facile
irenicism in interfaith relations. The broadening of sympathies that
interfaith activity encourages should not be allowed to degenerate
into a blurring of the ideological differences between religions,
which indeed can only result in conflict and the corrosion of
interfaith ideals. As partners in dialogue we ignore the reality and
richness of religious diversity at our peril. 
</p>
<p>But
if &lsquo;it is necessary to acknowledge differences and deal with
them&rsquo;, it also behoves us to recognise and respect those ideals
and values that we share in common with the followers of other
faiths. In the course of the last century a cosmic shift has taken
place in interfaith affairs as evidenced in the impact of Vatican II,
the outworkings of a series of Parliaments of the World&rsquo;s
Religions, the proliferation of global and local interfaith
organisations and initiatives, radical rethinking regarding the role
of missionary enterprise, possibilities for communal worship, and so
on. One of the great issues of the moment in interfaith circles is
whether the religions can agree on a set of common or shared values
which would provide a sufficient degree of coherence to produce a
&lsquo;Global Ethic&rsquo;. What lies behind this is the thought that
even if we can&rsquo;t (or cannot easily) agree on things
theological, across the religions, we can perhaps find real common
ground with regard to a generally agreed set of moral values and
standards. After all, the historic religions, and indeed responsible
humanists also, seem to espouse generally comparable ideals for the
conduct of human affairs and relationships. Very much under the
inspiration of the great Hans Kung, a great variety of organisations
and interests are looking now at how this might be achieved as a
basis for interfaith dialogue and development. 
</p>
<p>Ethical
dialogue and agreement is one thing, of course; theological dialogue
is something else. One recalls the reported comment of a Zen Buddhist
abbot who remarked: &lsquo;I get rather tired of people telling me
that all the ways are the same. They are spectacularly not the same!&rsquo;
And when we come down to some of the central theological concepts
such as the personhood of God, the mystery of suffering, the means of
grace, and the world to come, we can understand why there seems to be
more mutual mileage in the ideal of the Global Ethic than in anything
like theological convergence across the religions. 
</p>
<p>At
the same time the Global Ethic ideal, in spite of its feast of
possibilities, leaves one with a pang of hunger&mdash;and the
tentative hope that, somewhere beyond the possibility of a sort of
global moral solidarity, the ultimate dream of &lsquo;theological
alignment&rsquo; might be realised. Is it possible that,
notwithstanding the many and complex issues of faith and doctrine
seeking resolution, a key or clue to the advancement of theological
dialogue could lie in the recognition that if the ethical dimension
represents the &lsquo;basic prose&rsquo; of religion, theology is its
poetry, abounding in symbolism, metaphor, and the language of myth as
it attempts to describe that which is ultimately indescribable? As
poetry it represents an extraordinarily powerful vehicle for the
expression of spiritual truth, but its findings are inevitably
limited by the boundaries of human thought and language, as by
diverse paths in different spiritual traditions it seeks an ultimate
and universal goal. The challenge for theological dialogue is to
recognise the limitations of all religious language and to move
beyond the divisive constraints of theological literalism towards an
appreciation of the power and majesty and truth of the poetry of
faith within the religious experience of humankind. This may be the
arena where the spiritual traditions ultimately have to come to terms
with each other, discovering the possibilities for theological global
understanding through mutual acceptance and appreciation of the
poetic inheritance of the religions, by which we variously reach for
Transcendence.</p>

<p>The
two references that follow seem particularly pertinent to the idea
that this viewpoint on the nature of theology could help the
religions move towards fuller mutual understanding and symbiosis:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It
    is the very ineffability of God / Ultimate Reality that presents a
    basis for theological agreement across religions. All our theologies,
    from whatever religious tradition they emanate, are schematic,
    analogical attempts to describe the Indescribable. The great
    religious systems are all aspirational in trying to say something
    meaningful about what God (or Ultimate Reality) is like&mdash;in
    terms of fatherhood, creativity or life-force. If we can realise that
    fundamental area of commonality, then a new sense of openness and
    objectivity can inform our endeavours towards theological dialogue.
    (Dr Chris Arthur, <I>In The Hall of Mirrors: Problems of Commitment
      in a Religiously Plural World</I>, 1986)</p>
  <p>We
    must recognise that, ultimately, all religions possess a provisional,
    interim character as ways and signs to help us in our pilgrimage to
    Ultimate Truth and Perfection. Theology . . . represents the struggle
    of faith seeking understanding . . . and any dialogue must wrestle
    with this task. By relating our respective visions of the Divine to
    each other we can discover a still greater splendour of divine life
    and grace. I am not advocating a single-minded and synthetic model of
    World Religion . . . . What I want is for each tradition (and
    especially my own) <I>to break through its own particularity</I> (as
    Paul Tillich put it). Indeed, Tillich is worth listening to here: <I>In
      the depth of every living religion there is a point at which religion
      itself loses its importance, and that to which it points breaks
      through its particularity, elevating it to spiritual freedom and to a
      vision of the spiritual presence in other expressions of the ultimate
      meaning of human existence</I>. (Dr Robert Runcie, Francis
    Younghusband Memorial Lecture, 1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The
interfaith experience reinforces the sense that the Divine transcends
human thought and language, that our theologies are all
&lsquo;provisional&rsquo;, &lsquo;interim&rsquo; attempts to express
the Inexpressible, and therefore no religion (and certainly no
Church!) can claim a monopoly of truth. It is this that offers the
ultimate basis for accepting others&rsquo; religious legitimacy,
while seeking sincerely to maintain one&rsquo;s own. This is, I
believe, what Christianity must grasp in the exciting experience of
encounter with people of faith worldwide.</p>
