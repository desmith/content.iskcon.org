<p><a href="99-biodata.html#jas">Jayadvaita
Swami</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
add anything. Don&rsquo;t subtract anything. Don&rsquo;t change
anything.&rsquo; This was the instruction ISKCON&rsquo;s
founder-<I>acarya, </I>Srila Prabhupada, many times gave to his
disciples. Yet some disciples he engaged to edit his words for
publication&mdash;that is (by definition) to add, subtract, and
change. Here I present a brief history of that editorial work.</p>
<p>Before Srila
Prabhupada came to the West, his writing, publishing, and
distribution were a &lsquo;one-man show&rsquo;. He himself did
it all. The only editing done on his writing was whatever editing he
did himself.</p>
<p>He put substance
ahead of language. As stated in the <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>
(1.5.11): &lsquo;Literature that is full of descriptions of the
glories of the unlimited Supreme Lord is a different creation, full
of transcendental words directed toward bringing about a revolution
in the impious lives of this world&rsquo;s misdirected civilization&rsquo;.
Even if imperfectly composed, the <I>Bhagavatam</I> says, such
literature is &lsquo;heard, sung, and accepted by purified men who
are thoroughly honest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Srila Prabhupada was
aware of the shortcomings of his English. As he himself wrote in his
unedited commentary on this verse:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We know that in our honest attempt for
    presenting this great literature conveying the transcendental message
    for reviving God-consciousness of the people in general, as a matter
    of re-spiritualisation of the world atmosphere,&mdash;is fret with
    many difficulties. Regard being had to the facts that our capacity of
    presenting the matter in adequate language, specially a foreign
    language, will certainly fail and there may be so many literary
    discrepancies inspite of our honest attempt to present it in the
    proper way. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, he had hope:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But we are sure that with our all
    faults in this connection the seriousness of the subject matter will
    be taken into consideration and the leaders of the society will still
    accept this on account of its being an honest attempt for glorifying
    the Almighty Great so much now badly needed.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered an example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When there is fire in the house, the
    inmates of the house go out for help from the neighbors who may be
    foreigners to such inmates and yet without any adequate language the
    victims of the fire express themselves and the neighbors understand
    the need even though not expressed in adequate language.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The same spirit of co-operation is
    needed in the matter of broadcasting this transcendental message of
    the Srimad Bhagwatam throughout the whole poluted atmosphere of the
    present day world situation. After all it is a technical science of
    spiritual values and as such we are concerned with the techniques and
    not with the language. If the techniques of this great literature are
    understood by the people of the world, there is the success.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet
once Srila Prabhupada came to the West, he wanted his writings
edited: &lsquo;I wish that all copies, before finally going to the
press, must be thoroughly revised and edited so that there may not be
any mistakes especially of spelling and grammar or of
the Sanskrit names.&rsquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote10anc" HREF="#sdendnote10sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p><strong>How were the books written?</strong></p>
<p>Before we discuss the editing, let&rsquo;s
first look at how the books were written.</p>
<p>Some books Srila
Prabhupada wrote out in longhand or typed himself. These include <I>Easy
Journey to Other Planets, Sri Isopanisad,</I> the first and second
cantos of <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam, </I>the first five or six chapters of
<I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </I>and chapters one through five or six
of <I>Sri</I> <I>Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila.</I></p>
<p>Most
of his books, however, he dictated on a Grundig dictating machine,
using tapes that each afforded perhaps an hour of dictation. This
enabled him to achieve greater speed. Yet the method had its
drawbacks: he had less opportunity to review and revise his words, he
sometimes spoke passages twice, and&mdash;most
of all&mdash;he had to depend on the
accuracy of his transcribers. Especially in the early years, accuracy
was poor. The transcribers were not yet deeply familiar with his
philosophy, they had difficulty with his strong Bengali accent, and
most of his Sanskrit words and quotations were strange to their
ears.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote11anc" HREF="#sdendnote11sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
Moreover, Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s frequent clicking of the switch to
start, stop, and review his dictation clipped short many words or
deleted them entirely.</p>
<p>This resulted in
numerous gaps and errors. Sometimes transcribers simply left things
out&mdash;entire Sanskrit quotations,
for example&mdash;or gave only phonetic
approximations. Sometimes they could only guess at what Srila
Prabhupada was saying, and often guessed wrong.</p>
<p>This
was most conspicuously true for <I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I>,<I> </I>and
to a lesser extent for the &lsquo;Krsna Book&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote12anc" HREF="#sdendnote12sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP><I>
</I>In later books, the quality improved.
Srila Prabhupada, instead of mailing tapes for transcription, had a
transcriber personally travelling with him. The transcribers became
well versed in his philosophy, accustomed to his accent, and familiar
with his favourite quotations. And some of the transcribers learned
the Sanskrit and Bengali alphabets in order to refer to the source
texts that Srila Prabhupada himself was using. So errors in
transcription, though they still occurred, became considerably less
frequent and less severe.</p>
<p>Some
of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books were compiled from his recorded
lectures or conversations. Examples are <I>Teachings of Queen Kunti,
Teachings of Lord Kapila, </I>and small books like <I>On the Way to
Krsna </I>and <I>The Perfection of Yoga. The Nectar of Instruction
</I>was exceptional. Srila Prabhupada dictated it to disciples who
took down his words longhand.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>For some books Srila
Prabhupada saw the edited manuscript or a pre-press blueprint. For
most he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Who were the editors?</strong></p>
<p>Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s editors were various. His first steady editor was
Rayarama Dasa, an early disciple who worked professionally as a
freelance writer for comic books. By the time I joined Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s society, in 1968, Rayarama was among what Srila
Prabhupada called &lsquo;the main pillars of the society&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
Next came Hayagriva Dasa, whom Srila Prabhupada met in 1966 while
walking down a street on New York&rsquo;s Lower East Side. Hayagriva
(then known as Howard Wheeler) had an MA in English,
and as he relates, Srila Prabhupada (then most often referred to
simply as &lsquo;the Swami&rsquo;) had work for him to do:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Noticing that he has
    been typing, I offer to type for him, and he hands me the manuscript
    of the First Chapter, Second Canto, of Vyasadeva&rsquo;s
    S<I>rimad-Bhagavatam</I>.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can type
    this?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh yes&rsquo;,
    I say.</p>
  <p>He is delighted. We roll a small
    typewriter table out of the corner, and I begin work. His manuscript
    is single spaced without margins on flimsy, yellowing Indian paper.
    It appears that the Swami tried to squeeze every word possible onto
    the pages. I have to use a ruler to keep from losing my place.</p>
  <p>The first words
    read: &lsquo;O the king&rsquo;. I naturally wonder whether &lsquo;O&rsquo;
    is the king&rsquo;s name, and &lsquo;the king&rsquo; stands in
    
    apposition. After concluding that &lsquo;O King&rsquo; is intended
    instead, I consult the Swami.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;,
    he says. &lsquo;Change it, then.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As I retype another paragraph, I notice
    certain grammatical discrepancies, perhaps typical of Bengalis who
    learned English from British headmasters in the early 1900s.
    Considerable editing is required to get the text to conform with
    current American usage. After pointing out a few changes, I tell the
    Swami that if he so desired, I could make all the proper corrections.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very good&rsquo;,
    he says, smiling. &lsquo;Do it! Put it nicely.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Thus my editorial services begin.</p>
  <p>I type all morning
    in the room where he reads, translates, welcomes visitors, and &lsquo;takes
    rest&rsquo;. There is a tin footlocker, used as a desk, and a rug on
    which he sits and sometimes sleeps. Apart from my typewriter table,
    there is no other furniture. As I type, I hear him cooking in the
    kitchen, and can smell the butter being boiled to make ghee. I finish
    the chapter: twenty pages, double spaced with wide margins. The
    original had filled only eight pages.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me know
    if there&rsquo;s any more work&rsquo;, I tell him. &lsquo;I can take
    it back to Mott Street and type there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;More? Yes&rsquo;,
    he says. &lsquo;There is lots more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He opens the closet door and pulls out
    two large bundles tied with saffron cloth. Within, he shows me
    thousands of pages of single spaced, marginless manuscripts of
    literatures unknown in the Western world. I stand before them,
    astounded.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
    lifetime of typing&rsquo;, I protest.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo;
    he smiles happily. &lsquo;Many lifetimes.&rsquo; (Hayagriva Dasa, pp.
    15&ndash;16)</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Another early
  disciple, Satsvarupa Dasa (later Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami), did
  considerable editing on Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s early dictated
  works. Gaurasundara Dasa and others also tried their hand at editing.
  In 1970 I gradually began, and later in the 1970s, Dravida Dasa. </p>
<p>For Sanskrit, Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s first editor was Pradyumna Dasa, who continued to
serve as the main Sanskrit editor throughout Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
life. Among the other editors in what eventually became the BBT
Sanskrit department were Nitai Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Santosa Dasa,
Jayasacinandana Dasa, and Gopiparanadhana Dasa.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of editing was done?</strong></p>
<p>In
principle, the editing Srila Prabhupada asked for was minimal:
&lsquo;[S]imply we have to see that in our book there is no spelling
or grammatical mistake. We do not mind for any good style, our style
is Hare Krsna,
but, still, we should not present a shabby thing.&rsquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>In
practice, to keep from shabbiness, more than grammar and spelling was
involved. Apart from spelling, grammar, and punctuation, the editors
applied standards of consistency (&lsquo;Deity&rsquo; or &lsquo;deity&rsquo;?
&lsquo;spirit-soul&rsquo; or &lsquo;spirit soul&rsquo;?). They tried
to make sure that pronouns had unambiguous antecedents. They broke
long paragraphs into shorter ones. They turned passive constructions
(&lsquo;and the rest is being awaited by Him&rsquo;) into active
(&lsquo;and He is awaiting the rest&rsquo;).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote16anc" HREF="#sdendnote16sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
They made skewed constructions parallel.</p>
<p>They turned British
or Indian usages into American. &lsquo;We have got&rsquo; often
became &lsquo;we have&rsquo;. Rupees became dollars, &lsquo;lakhs and
crores&rsquo; became &lsquo;thousands and millions&rsquo;, and
figures like &lsquo;1,00,000&rsquo; (one lakh) became &lsquo;100,000&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In some instances, minor examples that
would have seemed strange or jarring to a Western reader were
modified or deleted.</p>
<p>In the books as
published, when Srila Prabhupada quotes a verse in Sanskrit an
English translation usually follows. Most often, this translation was
inserted by the editors. It was the editors, too, who routinely
supplied the chapter-verse references (Srila Prabhupada did so only
on occasion) and corrected wrong ones.</p>
<p>When
Srila Prabhupada used outmoded rhetorical devices, like parenthetical
question marks or exclamation marks to express irony&mdash;&lsquo;the
modernised Sanyasins (?)&rsquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="#sdendnote17sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>&mdash;the
editors deleted them.</p>
<p>The
editors often changed Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s choice of words.
&lsquo;Therefore give up your disparity of mind&rsquo; became
&lsquo;Therefore give up your anxiety&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>
And the <I>gopis</I>, in the edited &lsquo;Krsna Book&rsquo;,
modestly try to cover their nakedness not &lsquo;by placing the
left-hand palm upon the vagina&rsquo; but &lsquo;by placing their
left hand over their pubic area&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote19anc" HREF="#sdendnote19sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>Any editor,
typically, strives to bring out a work that is properly polished and
yet stay as close to the author&rsquo;s language as possible. For
Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books, this could be especially challenging.
The technical nature of the subject, the enlightened status of the
author, the sense that Krsna
Himself was speaking through him, and the charm, grace, simplicity,
and precision so often found in his personal voice&mdash;all
these were in constant tension with a grammar and diction just as
often in need of serious repair.</p>
<p>And then again, by
working so much with Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s writings and in his
Society, an editor could be lulled into accepting Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
nonstandard locutions as standard. The use of &lsquo;benedict&rsquo;
as a verb, and &lsquo;semina&rsquo;<I> </I>instead of &lsquo;semen&rsquo;,
thus sometimes bluffed their way past the editors&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>The
editors pruned for conciseness. &lsquo;Since he has departed from
this place it is now seven months past up to date but he has not as
yet returned back from there&rsquo; became &lsquo;Since he departed,
seven months have passed, yet he has not returned&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote20anc" HREF="#sdendnote20sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP>
Sometimes redundant sentences were deleted and sometimes (again
because of redundancy) entire paragraphs.</p>
<p>Before coming to
America, Srila Prabhupada had twice translated some or all of the
first five or six chapters of <I>Sri</I> <I>Caitanya-caritamrta,</I>
so as editor I amalgamated the two manuscripts, choosing text
sometimes from one, sometimes the other. And for books
compiled from lectures, of course, extensive cutting and rearranging
were required.</p>
<p>For all of Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s books, the editors checked and revised for mundane
accuracy. When Srila Prabhupada gave mathematical calculations, did
the numbers tally? When he gave a geographical reference, did it
match the map?</p>
<p>For grammar,
clarity, readability, and flow, the editors routinely changed Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s sentence structure&mdash;often
utterly reworking it&mdash;merging
sentences, or severing them, or rearranging clauses, striving for a
suitable mixture of simple sentences and complex.</p>
<p>Connectivity was
another concern. Did each sentence follow from the one before? For
this the editors routinely added connectives: &lsquo;and&rsquo;,
&lsquo;but&rsquo;, &lsquo;however&rsquo;, &lsquo;therefore&rsquo;,
&lsquo;nonetheless&rsquo;. (Hayagriva was particularly liberal with
&lsquo;indeed&rsquo;, and I became nearly as generous.)</p>
<p>The
editors worked for clarity, euphony, and force. Srila Prabhupada
wrote to Hayagriva, &lsquo;I am glad that you are not omitting
anything, but just making grammatical correction, and phrasing for
force and clarity, and adding Pradyumna's transliteration, that is
very nice&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote21anc" HREF="#sdendnote21sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP>
In practice, as mentioned, such editing was a multifaceted task.</p>
<p>A large part of this
task&mdash;this is where Pradyumna came
in&mdash;was the Sanskrit editing.
Pradyumna began by learning, on his own, to transliterate Devanagari
into roman characters. Srila Prabhupada was pleased, and Pradyumna,
going further, became expert in the Sanskrit language. He tells of
his role:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sanskrit
    editing means that I would put the correct diacritic marks on the
    Sanskrit words, and I would spell them correctly according to the
    international system. I would also adjust Prabhupada&rsquo;s grammar
    in the word-for-word translations. Also, if something were missing, I
    would send a lot of queries, &lsquo;What about this, what about that,
    is this okay?&rsquo; I had a lot of letters from Prabhupada, &lsquo;Yes,
    you can do this. You can do this. Yes, that&rsquo;s okay&rsquo;.
    (Siddhanta Dasa, p. 10)<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote22anc" HREF="#sdendnote22sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pradyumna
was speaking modestly. He did considerably more. He&rsquo;s the one
who set the Sanskrit transliteration standards for Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
books, who systematised the division of Sanskrit compound words into
their constituent parts, who set rules of style (italics? caps?), and
who made scriptural verse references a consistent feature.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote23anc" HREF="#sdendnote23sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>Beyond this, he
answered countless queries from the English editors, and straightened
the editors out when they misunderstood intended meanings. I remember
that on one occasion, when a passage for the last chapter of the
&lsquo;Krsna
Book&rsquo; was unclear, Pradyumna and I sent a query to Srila
Prabhupada, who simply sent back a one-word answer: <I>yaduvaraparisat.
</I>In other words, &lsquo;This is the word I&rsquo;m translating.
You figure it out and set things right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 1972 Pradyumna
joined Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s personal entourage and travelled with
him to serve as Sanskrit editor for the rest of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
days. While travelling with him, Pradyumna often did considerable
work in editing his translations.</p>
<p>To give an extreme
example of how much Pradyumna might revise, we may consider
S<I>rimad-Bhagavatam </I>5.22.2. Here is the transcription of Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s original dictation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SG answered, My dear
    king, it is exactly like the big wheel which is moving and along with
    him the small ants which have taken shelter of the big wheel, they
    are also moving; that is to say, the big wheel is moving towards
    northern side, the small ants also moving towards that side.
    Similarly, with movement of the big orbit, the small stars appear to
    be moving along with it, so when passing through the Dhruva loka and
    Sumeru mountain, the small ant-like stars also move like that. So
    with the movement of the sun and other small planets and stars which
    have taken shelter of the big orbit moves in the same direction,
    therefore, it sometimes appears to be moving differently in different
    directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Pradyumna&rsquo;s revision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sri SG answered, My
    dear king, it is exactly like the wheel of the potter which is moving
    and along with it the small ants which are located on the big wheel,
    they are also moving along with the wheel, but their motion is seen
    to be different because they are noticed at one time to be in one
    place and later in another on the wheel. Similarly, with movement of
    the wheel of time which is observed by the constellations and signs.
    They are moving to the right around Dhruva loka and Sumeru mountain
    and moving with them are the ant-like planets like the sun and other
    small planets. But because these planets are seen in different
    constellations and signs at different times, the motion of these
    planets is different from the motion of the zodiac or wheel of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is how the verse finally
appeared in print:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sri Sukadeva
    Gosvami clearly
    answered: When a potter&rsquo;s wheel is moving
    and small ants located on that big wheel are moving with it, one can
    see that their motion is different from that of the wheel because
    they appear sometimes on one part of the wheel and sometimes on
    another. Similarly, the signs and constellations, with Sumeru and
    Dhruvaloka on their right, move with the wheel of time, and the
    antlike sun and other planets move with them. The sun and planets,
    however, are seen in different signs and constellations at different
    times. This indicates that their motion is different from that of the
    zodiac and the wheel of time itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In
a lecture in 1973, Srila Prabhupada, on the occasion of his
Vyasa-puja,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote24anc" HREF="#sdendnote24sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP>
expressed his gratitude for Pradyumna&rsquo;s service. Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s edition of <I>Sri</I> <I>Caitanya-caritamrta </I>had
just been published, and Srila Prabhupada humbly gave Pradyumna this
credit for the book:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our Panditji,
    Pradyumna, he has presented. Actually, he has worked for it. Although
    I have translated, . . . I am very much indebted to him that he very
    carefully edits and makes the thing very perfect. . . . Because
    mostly there is Sanskrit portion, my beloved disciple Pradyumna&mdash;I
    call him Pandit
    Mahasaya because he is actually doing the pandit&rsquo;s work&mdash;so
    he edits and he works very hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s final literary work&mdash;S<I>rimad-Bhagavatam</I>,<I>
</I>Tenth Canto, Chapter Thirteen<I>&mdash;</I>the
last portion was in fact an extraordinary collaboration between Srila
Prabhupada and Pradyumna. While Srila Prabhupada lay prone on his
bed, close to death, Pradyumna, having studied the Sanskrit verses
and the Sanskrit commentaries Srila Prabhupada preferred, would read
them to him in Sanskrit, in small portions. Some portions
Pradyumna would translate and read out, some Srila
Prabhupada himself would translate, and Srila Prabhupada would
comment. The translations and commentary, recorded on tape, were then
blended and edited together to become the text for the book.</p>

<p><strong>Revisions to BBT
books</strong></p>
<p>Starting
from the early 1970s, or perhaps even earlier, the BBT has published
revised versions of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote35anc" HREF="#sdendnote35sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></SUP>
The editorial staff discovered occasional errors in published books
and routinely corrected them in later printings. Rarely, Srila
Prabhupada himself also pointed out a word
or passage he wanted revised.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote36anc" HREF="#sdendnote36sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SUP>
In accordance with standard publishing practice,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote37anc" HREF="#sdendnote37sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></SUP>
the BBT published such revisions without giving notice.</p>
<p>Also
beginning from the early 1970s, the BBT began publishing Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s books in versions revised so extensively that they
deserved to be called &lsquo;second editions&rsquo;. The first of
these were re-edited versions of <I>Easy Journey to Other Planets
</I>(1972)<I> </I>and <I>Sri Isopanisad</I>,<I> </I>both revised by<I>
</I>Hayagriva Dasa on the grounds that the English editing stood in
need of substantial improvement.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote38anc" HREF="#sdendnote38sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A></SUP>
Sometime in 1972 or 1973 I made extensive revisions to the Second
Canto. The revised version, though never marked &ldquo;Second
Edition,&rdquo; was used in all printings after the first.</p>
<p>In 1974 the BBT
published a second edition of <I>Teachings of Lord Caitanya</I>,<I>
</I>again revised for English by Hayagriva. (He revised the book
entirely from the published text, without benefit of the original
manuscripts, by then lost, or Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
<I>Caitanya-caritamrta</I>, not yet written.)<I> </I>The second
edition used Sanskrit diacritical spellings, and with Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s permission Nitai Dasi supplied transliterations
for many Sanskrit verses given in the first edition only in
English.</p>
<p>In
1972, when the first American edition of <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>,<I>
</I>First Canto, was in preparation and the first volume nearly ready
for printing, Satsvarupa brought to Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
attention that in numerous instances the edited version seemed to
have low fidelity to Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s original work. Srila
Prabhupada responded, in essence: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t lose time. Just
print it&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote39anc" HREF="#sdendnote39sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>In 1976, however, on
my own initiative, I did extensive revisions for this canto,
especially for the translations in the first two chapters. I then
prepared a list showing these revised translations, with a cover
letter explaining what I had done, and when Srila Prabhupada visited
ISKCON New York in July of 1976 I brought the package to his room.</p>
<p>I had expected
merely to drop it off with his secretary. But to my surprise I found
Srila Prabhupada right there before me, asking to know why I had
come. I told him, and he instructed me to
read to him the revised
translations, right there on the spot. So I began, Srila Prabhupada
listening attentively, and after I had read a few verses he
interrupted: &lsquo;So, what you have done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
revised the translations to make them closer to what Your Divine
Grace originally said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <I>I
</I>have said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Srila
Prabhupada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Srila Prabhupada
then made a characteristic dismissive gesture and said: &lsquo;Then
it is all right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And
that was that.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote40anc" HREF="#sdendnote40sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>After
Srila Prabhupada passed away, the BBT editorial staff continued to
notice and correct editorial discrepancies in Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
books. Many of these were brought to light by ISKCON devotees,
especially those serving as BBT translators.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote41anc" HREF="#sdendnote41sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A></SUP>
(The BBT has translated books by Srila Prabhupada into some
eighty-five languages.) As during Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s presence,
the BBT continued to correct minor editorial errors routinely,
without giving notice.</p>
<p>But
again as in Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s time, for some books more
extensive revisions seemed needed. Thus in 1979 the BBT trustees
resolved: &lsquo;Harikesa Swami will discuss with Satsvarupa Goswami
and Jayadvaita Swami about the necessary corrections in original
manuscripts such as <I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I> (complete ed), 3rd
canto, etc&rsquo;.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote42anc" HREF="#sdendnote42sym"><SUP>33</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>My
review of <I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I> turned up editorial errors
and omissions extensive enough to warrant a second edition. And so,
after extensive consultation with senior ISKCON devotees, the second
edition was published in 1983.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote43anc" HREF="#sdendnote43sym"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>For
<I>The Nectar of Devotion </I>I did a light revision, published by
the BBT in 1982. Probably the most prominent feature of this second
edition was some adjustment to the structure of the chapters. Several
of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s original chapters had been large, so
Rayarama had broken them down, at somewhat arbitrary intervals, into
chapters of a comfortable size.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote44anc" HREF="#sdendnote44sym"><SUP>35</SUP></A></SUP>
While revising the book, I found that some chapter titles and section
titles mismatched their contents,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote45anc" HREF="#sdendnote45sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A></SUP>
and some chapters began in the midst of a topic, rather than before
or after. I renamed and redivided accordingly. The second edition
also included an appendix that showed where the &lsquo;waves&rsquo;
of Srila Rupa Gosvami&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ocean of Devotional Service&rsquo;
had their places in Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
summary study.</p>
<p><A NAME="LastPlace"></A>In
1993, Dravida Dasa revised <I>Sri Isopanisad,</I> comparing the first
and second American editions with the original text Srila Prabhupada
had published in 1960 in his <I>Back to Godhead. </I>Again, Dravida
recovered extensive passages that earlier editions had lost.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote46anc" HREF="#sdendnote46sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A></SUP>
In 1996 the BBT also published second editions of &lsquo;Krsna Book&rsquo;
and <I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </I>both revised by Dravida Dasa, who
corrected errors and included passages earlier omitted.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote47anc" HREF="#sdendnote47sym"><SUP>38</SUP></A></SUP>
For <I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,</I> also, many geographical place
names fussily Sanskritised by the editors of the first edition were
rendered in the vernacular forms by which the places are actually
known.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s the
BBT published a second edition of <I>Perfect Questions, Perfect
Answers, </I>edited by a less experienced BBT editor. Because readers
of this edition pointed out numerous editorial discrepancies, the BBT
directors resolved in 2002 that Dravida Dasa will review the book
before its next printing. Either he will correct the discrepancies,
or the BBT will revert to the first edition.</p>
<p>Apart
from the books mentioned here as having been revised, all of Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s books continue to be published only in their
original editions, with only occasional minor corrections for
typographical and other such errors. So, for example, the
<I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I> from the Second Canto onwards continues to
be published only in its original BBT edition.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote48anc" HREF="#sdendnote48sym"><SUP>39</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>Because
translators, indexers, and other readers who intensively study Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s books continue to turn up suspected editorial
errors, the BBT provides an e-mail address to which such errors may
be sent: &lt;errors.english.books@pamho.net&gt;.
As a matter of policy the BBT editors, mindful of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
instructions, resist changes. But verified editorial errors are
corrected in later printings or editions. This policy has brought the
BBT some outspoken criticism, much of it, unfortunately, uncivil and
badly uninformed.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote49anc" HREF="#sdendnote49sym"><SUP>40</SUP></A></SUP>
An extended response to such criticism stands beyond the scope of
this article.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote50anc" HREF="#sdendnote50sym"><SUP>41</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p><strong>Keeping track of BBT editorial history</strong></p>
<p>Because on the title
and copyright pages of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books the BBT staff
has often been less than meticulous about recording new editions, for
some books, especially those published and revised during Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s lifetime, one may have a hard time discerning
which edition one is reading. Aware of this, the BBT directors have
resolved that future printings should make the publishing history
more clear.</p>
<p>Additionally, in
2002 the BBT directors hired a consultant to conceive of a
comprehensive system for keeping track of the editorial history of
each English BBT title. The system, the directors said, should enable
us to preserve, catalogue, and access the various edited and unedited
versions, and it should tell us, for each version, who did what,
when, and why, both in summary and, ideally, at the level of the
sentence or the word. And the system should work for other languages
as well.</p>
<p>The consultant has
provided specifications for such a system, ambitious in scope, and
work is underway at the Bhaktivedanta Archives. The envisioned
outcome is a searchable hypertext library, perhaps accessible on the
internet, that would enable a researcher who selects a particular
verse or passage to view the relevant pages of the original and
revised manuscripts, any editorial notes, the first and later
editions, the Sanskrit or Bengali commentaries Srila Prabhupada
consulted, and so on. Also included for each title would be a
production history, naming the original editors, typesetters,
proofreaders, layout people, and other production people, telling
where the prepress work was done, giving the size of the first print
run, and telling who were the printers and binders for the original
edition.</p>
<p>By this system, the
BBT intends to keep, as far as practicable, an &lsquo;audit trail&rsquo;
for scholars, BBT staff, and other interested readers, so that most
readers can have the benefit of books carefully edited yet free from
burdensome critical apparatus while those who wish may avail
themselves of a detailed editorial history. In advance of such a
history, I hope the present overview will be of some service to
seekers of editorial truth.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote10sym" HREF="#sdendnote10anc">1</A>
	Srila Prabhupada letter to Satsvarupa Dasa, 25 January
	1970.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote11sym" HREF="#sdendnote11anc">2</A>
	In recent years, followers of Srila Prabhupada have produced
	video recordings of his lectures, with subtitles to make his words
	easier to follow. Yet the subtitles themselves are rich with
	examples of mishearing&mdash;an illustration that the problem is
	ongoing.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote12sym" HREF="#sdendnote12anc">3</A>
	This was how Srila Prabhupada referred to his book <I>Krsna,
	the Supreme Personality of Godhead</I>.<I> </I>
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote13sym" HREF="#sdendnote13anc">4</A>
	For the history of <I>The Nectar of Instruction </I>I am grateful to
	Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, who himself did the bulk of this work.</p>

	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote22sym" HREF="#sdendnote22anc">13</A>
	For other memories from Pradyumna about how he got started, see
	Siddhanta Dasa, pp. 4&ndash;5, 7, and 9&ndash;10.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote23sym" HREF="#sdendnote23anc">14</A>
	Srila Prabhupada therefore wrote to Pradyumna (on 21 June
	1970), &lsquo;So your efforts in the matter of our Sanskrit editing
	are effectively improving our books more and more with scholarly
	standards&rsquo;. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote24sym" HREF="#sdendnote24anc">15</A>
	Vyasa-puja is the celebration for the &lsquo;appearance
	day&rsquo; (birthday) of the spiritual master. The lecture took
	place on 22 August 1973, in London.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote25sym" HREF="#sdendnote25anc">16</A>
	The manuscript for the complete book was prepared for publication,
	but it was abridged at the request of the original publisher, the
	Macmillan Company. Brahmananda Dasa (personal interview, 5
	April 2003) reports that Rayarama Dasa flew from New
	York to Los Angeles to abridge the manuscript in direct consultation
	with Srila Prabhupada. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote26sym" HREF="#sdendnote26anc">17</A>
	At first, several devotees had a hand in editing this book.
	Brahmananda Dasa says, &lsquo;We were all working on it. I
	mean, I did it, and Kirtanananda did it, Satsvarupa, Hayagriva,
	Rayarama, I think even Ranchor. We all had a shot at it.
	Anyone with any education&rsquo; (personal interview, 5 May 2003).
	Similarly, Pradyumna Dasa reports, &lsquo;A lot of people were
	editing Prabhupada&rsquo;s books when they first came into
	Montreal. Kirtanananda had a copy of the <I>Gita</I>
	manuscript, Hayagriva had something else, and Rayarama had
	something else. These were the early days of ISKCON&mdash;1967, &rsquo;68&rsquo;
	(<I>Memories</I>,<I> </I>Vol. 2, p. 7). Hayagriva and Rayarama
	finally became the editors for the book. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote27sym" HREF="#sdendnote27anc">18</A>
	Satsvarupa did preliminary editing, as he did on all the books for
	which he is listed. Here Rayarama was the main editor. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote28sym" HREF="#sdendnote28anc">19</A>
	Purusottama, who transcribed the book while travelling with Srila
	Prabhupada as secretary, did some preliminary editing.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote29sym" HREF="#sdendnote29anc">20</A>
	Each of the first nine chapters was first published as an individual
	paperback book.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote30sym" HREF="#sdendnote30anc">21</A>
	Dravida edited chapters 13, 14, 15, and
	17. I oversaw and polished his work and edited the rest of the book.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote31sym" HREF="#sdendnote31anc">22</A>
	Dravida edited chapters 17 and 25 and at least parts of 18 and 26. I
	oversaw and polished his work and edited the rest of the book.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote32sym" HREF="#sdendnote32anc">23</A>
	Syamasundara did some preliminary editing and gave useful
	editorial suggestions.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote33sym" HREF="#sdendnote33anc">24</A>
	The text for this book came from articles previously edited by
	various editors and published in <I>Back to Godhead. </I>I chose the
	articles and their sequence. Ramesvara Swami and Mukunda (later
	Mukunda Goswami) added one or two more articles and wrote the titles
	and introductions. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote34sym" HREF="#sdendnote34anc">25</A>
	Chapter 13 was published after Srila Prabhupada passed away.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote35sym" HREF="#sdendnote35anc">26</A>
	In 1972, <I>Easy Journey to Other Planets </I>and <I>Krsna
	Consciousness: The Topmost Yoga System </I>were registered with the
	US Copyright Office with &lsquo;Revisions and additions&rsquo;. But
	minor errors in these and other books may have been noticed and
	fixed in still earlier printings.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote36sym" HREF="#sdendnote36anc">27</A>
	The example most well known to ISKCON devotees: He pointed out that
	in <I>Bhagavad-gita </I>18.44 an editor had wrongly supplied
	for <I>go-raksya </I>the translation &lsquo;cattle-raising&rsquo;
	instead of &lsquo;cow protection&rsquo;. On another occasion he
	pointed out that &lsquo;purified rice&rsquo;, in <I>Bhagavatam
	</I>1.15.22&ndash;3, should have been &lsquo;putrefied rice&rsquo;.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote37sym" HREF="#sdendnote37anc">28</A>
	Both <I>The Chicago Manual of Style</I> and<I> The Oxford Style
	Manual</I> seem to regard the matter as routine. While noting the
	difference between a new edition (in which a work is significantly
	revised or enlarged) and a new impression (in which a book is simply
	reprinted), <I>Chicago</I> (p. 9) matter-of-factly says,
	&lsquo;Corrections are sometimes made in new impressions&rsquo;, and
	<I>Oxford</I> (p. 6) simply notes that one meaning of &lsquo;reprint&rsquo;
	is &lsquo;a second or new impression of any printed work, with only
	minor corrections&rsquo;.</p>
	<p>Expressing an
	uncontroversial view, one scholar goes so far as to say,
	&lsquo;[E]mendations in reprintings. . . have often been <I>fewer</I>
	than accuracy would demand.&rsquo; (Halpenny, p. 11, emphasis
	supplied.)</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote38sym" HREF="#sdendnote38anc">29</A>
	The revised editions of these books came under criticism in a
	discussion between Srila Prabhupada and some disciples in
	Vrndavana on 22 June 1977. With reference to a judgment by
	Srila Prabhupada, the discussion was later entitled &lsquo;Rascal
	Editors&rsquo;.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote39sym" HREF="#sdendnote39anc">30</A>
	At the time, I was working with ISKCON Press in Boston, where this
	incident took place, and Satsvarupa related it to me soon after it
	occurred.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote40sym" HREF="#sdendnote40anc">31</A>
	The revised version was published in 1976. A full comparison of the
	revised translations for the first two chapters is online as
	<I>Bhagavatam Revisions Examined </I>at
	www.krishna.com/newsite/main.php?id=286.</p>

	BBT resolutions, 12 March 1979. What was intended was that we were
	to see about necessary corrections with reference to the original
	manuscripts.</p>

	A brief history appears in <I>Responsible Publishing </I>(p. 29). A
	letter widely circulated to solicit input from ISKCON devotees
	before the book was published appears on pp. 29&ndash;33.
	<I>Responsible Publishing </I>is available online at
	www.krishna.com/newsite/downloads/responsible_publishing.pdf.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote44sym" HREF="#sdendnote44anc">35</A>
	Rayarama personally told me this, and I personally retyped
	the manuscripts that bore his editing.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote45sym" HREF="#sdendnote45anc">36</A>
	&lsquo;Techniques of Hearing and Memorizing&rsquo;, for example, had
	nothing to do with memorisation.</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote46sym" HREF="#sdendnote46anc">37</A>
	For examples, see <I>Responsible Publishing</I>, p. 8&ndash;9. 
	</p>
	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote47sym" HREF="#sdendnote47anc">38</A>
	For examples, see <I>Responsible Publishing</I>,<I> </I>p. 10&ndash;13.</p>
	<p>Some
	readers objected to one change in the revised <I>Caitanya-caritamrta</I>:<I>
	</I>In the introduction to the first chapter, the word &lsquo;initiated&rsquo;
	has twice been replaced by new wording. Regarding this objection as
	reasonable, the BBT directors agreed to review it. They sought
	counsel from eight senior, well educated devotees outside the BBT,
	who came to a split decision, four favoring the earlier version,
	four the later. The directors took the view that either version
	would be justifiable and the difference was of no great consequence.
	Of the two instances of &lsquo;initiated&rsquo;<I>,</I> one had come
	from Srila Prabhupada's original text (but was arguably not
	what he intended), the other from me as editor where grammar had
	required a verb supplied. Deferring to the original text, the
	directors decided to restore Srila Prabhupada's &lsquo;initiated&rsquo;
	but not mine. This revision will appear in the next printing.</p>

	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote48sym" HREF="#sdendnote48anc">39</A>
	Curiously, one website advertises the &lsquo;pre-1978 edition&rsquo;
	of the <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam. </I>What is it? The same edition
	the BBT has published all along.</p>

	<p><A CLASS="sdendnotesym" NAME="sdendnote49sym" HREF="#sdendnote49anc">40</A>
	For examples, see &lsquo;108 Changes to Srila Prabhupada's
	<I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I>&rsquo; by Madhudvisa Dasa
	(www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9903/ET08-3273.html) and &lsquo;In-Depth

	articles arguing various points of view is published online by the
	Vaishnava News Network at www.vnn.org/news/bbt_revisions.html.
	Anonymous critics of the BBT&rsquo;s editorial policies maintain a
	site, meant to appear populist, called &lsquo;Adi-vani.org&rsquo;
	(www.adi-vani.org).
