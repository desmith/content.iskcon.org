<p><a href="../10/05-edelmann.html">by Jonathan B. Edelmann, Vol. 10</a></p>
<p><a href="../11/99-biodata.html#cmb">C. Mackenzie Brown</a></p>
<p>How
can an informed devotee conceptualise God&rsquo;s interaction with
the world in the context of contemporary science? In his article,
&lsquo;God and Science: Christian and Vaisnava
Perspectives&rsquo;, Jonathan Edelmann provides a twofold answer. In
the inanimate domain, God acts only through mediating powers,
avoiding personal involvement. With sentient beings, God acts
directly to foster spiritual development, responding to prayers, even
incarnating himself. This provocative approach allows Edelmann to
endorse the methodological naturalism fundamental to modern
scientific investigation when applied to what he calls the &lsquo;cosmic
management&rsquo; of the universe, while exempting from such a
methodological stricture the actions of both God and human beings. 
</p>
<p>Edelmann
develops his thesis with particular reference to the theistic Sankhya
of the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I>. Theistic Sankhya does not fit readily
into the four major models of the religion-science relationship
proposed by Ian Barbour: conflict, independence, dialogue, and
integration. Edelmann makes no explicit reference to these models,
but they are heuristically useful in analysing his essay,
specifically his positioning of theistic Sankhya vis-&agrave;-vis
selected Christian theological viewpoints. 
</p>
<p> Theistic
Sankhya as Edelmann presents it eschews the independence model, while
at times embracing modes of dialogue or integration, but at other
times courting conflict. Edelmann&rsquo;s problem with the
independence model is that it too readily reduces God and
non-physical consciousness to &lsquo;unneeded hypotheses that make no
difference to our understanding of the world&rsquo; (p. 52). As for
the ambivalence between conflict and harmony or integration
manifested in the <I>Bhagavata&rsquo;s</I> Sankhya, this tension is
also reflected in various Christian positions regarding God&rsquo;s
activity in the world. 
</p>
<p>Regarding
conflict, Edelmann notes Alvin Platinga&rsquo;s rejection of
methodological naturalism, a rejection necessitated in order to make
room for the possibility of God&rsquo;s special creation of worldly
phenomena without recourse to mediated action through secondary
causes. This view of God as cosmic magician, Edelmann suggests, has
often fostered the historical conflict between science and religion
when supposedly divine interventions are later understood in terms of
purely natural causes. 
</p>
<p>Edelmann
next considers Arthur Peacocke&rsquo;s cosmic musician. Peacocke
views God as bestowing on matter the capacity to evolve life out of
itself through the interplay of chance and law. Such improvisational
creativity is like composing a fugue: general themes may be
indicated, but specific notes are left undetermined. This view of
God&rsquo;s agency, constraining the world system as a whole but in a
way that does not contravene natural laws, harmonises with
methodological naturalism. But it does so, from Edelmann&rsquo;s
perspective, at the expense of, among other things, a God who alters
the world in response to prayer and of a non-material soul. 
</p>
<p>The
<I>Bhagavata&rsquo;s </I>Sankhya, Edelmann suggests, avoids the
shortcomings of both Christian conceptions of the cosmic magician and
musician. Theistic Sankhya regards the (inanimate) world as a fully
closed and self-contained system that is consilient with
methodological naturalism, while leaving room for the non-physical
agency of both God and the soul, by positing a radical dualism
between spirit/life/consciousness (<I>purusa) </I>and
matter/energy/nature (<I>prakrti</I>). 
</p>
<p>This
Sankhyan dichotomy only loosely corresponds to western distinctions
between mind and body, and the supernatural and natural. In the
Sankhyan view, <I>prakrti</I> incorporates not only potential
material energies and Platonic-like templates for material forms, but
also the material elements (subtle and gross) that evolve into the
physical universe, including mind, intellect, and ego. These latter,
in themselves unconscious, reflect the light of the conscious <I>puru</I><I>s</I><I>a</I>.
Spirit/consciousness encompasses God and <I>jivas</I>, or the
individual souls of all beings, including humans and <I>devas</I>
(lesser gods). <I>Jivas</I> are not material, yet are intertwined
with material properties like mind, ego, as well as body. Thus
souls/<I>devas</I> may be considered both as spirit (&lsquo;the <I>jiva</I>
is considered ontologically distinct from <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti</I>&rsquo;
(p. 56)) and as a &lsquo;product of <I>prakrti</I>&rsquo; (p. 58). 
</p>
<p> Differences
between Sankhyan and Western views allow Edelmann to problematise
Western understandings of the natural/supernatural distinction and
the body/soul relation. But from a contemporary scientific
perspective, the differences seem minimal: any radical disjunction of
consciousness and matter, whatever the terminology, is problematic.
While scientists (as scientists) have long abandoned delving into the
mind of God, they are increasingly probing into the nature of human
consciousness.</p>
<p>At
this point I would like to ask Edelmann for clarification on two
basic issues. First, how is the distinction between natural and
supernatural causation to be understood? Second, and closely related,
how does spirit interact with matter? Let me clarify each of these
questions.</p>
<p>Regarding
the first, Edelmann proposes that God creates the universe through
intermediary agents. These include time and various material energies
wielded by <I>devas</I> like Brahma who order the elements evolved
out of nature by time according to the templates in <I>prakrti</I>.
Edelmann then argues that Brahma, as a product of <I>prakrti</I> and
controlled by material forces (<I>gunas</I>), is a natural, not a
supernatural agency&mdash;who may appear supernatural because of his
superhuman powers. 
</p>
<p>I
regard this conclusion as problematic. If, on one hand, Brahma is
completely controlled by material energies, then he becomes
superfluous and God may as well be said to act directly in the world,
personally imposing on matter the eternal and &lsquo;most general
form of the universe, as well as the general forms of organisms&rsquo;
(p. 58). On the other hand, if Brahma exercises, in any meaningful
way, his free will (an inherent property of <I>jivas</I>, according
to Edelmann) in deciding how exactly to unfold the universe, then it
seems he is a &lsquo;hyper-natural&rsquo; if not supernatural cause&mdash;a
non-physical, conscious agent responsible, in however subtle a
manner, for manufacturing aspects of the empirical universe. If this
is the case, then Brahma seems to become a minor magician, similar to
Platinga&rsquo;s cosmic magician on a reduced scale, and equally
capable of frustrating methodological naturalism. 
</p>
<p>Parallel
to the problem of the natural/supernatural distinction is Sankhya&rsquo;s
radical disjunction of body and soul, which brings me to my second
question. Sankhya is faced with the same dilemma as those Christian
Cartesian philosophies that have proposed a body/mind (body/soul)
dualism: how does a non-physical agent activate material elements or
forces? What is the precise mode of this interaction? Whatever mode
is posited, would such activation be empirically detectable? This
leads to the question: is human consciousness truly non-physical?
Recent research in cognitive psychology and brain neurology suggest
other possibilities.  
</p>
<p> Edelmann
himself poses a related question in his conclusion: &lsquo;If God
reciprocates with our free will [...], then does God&rsquo;s action
interrupt [...] the normal ebb and flow of nature&rsquo;s
mechanisms?&rsquo; (p. 59) Edelmann leaves the question unanswered as
not essential to his goal of legitimating a theistic conception of
the inanimate universe compatible with methodological naturalism, yet
an answer is mandatory. And it seems the answer for Edelmann must be
yes, given that God&rsquo;s reciprocating actions involve not just
subtle influences in human consciousness but also physical effects in
the world, as in the case of <I>avataras</I> who visibly interact
with physical entities and impact natural events. This makes suspect
not only the viability of methodological naturalism in dealing with
&lsquo;how the actions of free, non-physical agents affect the world&rsquo;
(p. 59), but also calls into question the adequacy of methodological
naturalism in dealing with nature&rsquo;s mechanisms in
themselves&mdash;which Edelmann wishes to maintain. For the
distinction between &lsquo;cosmic management&rsquo;&mdash;a concern
Edelmann somewhat humorously considers too mundane for God&mdash;and
spiritual aid to living entities seems artificial, and the boundary
between indirect cosmic action and direct spiritual intervention
porous.</p>
<p> In conclusion, let me say that I agree
with Edelmann regarding the &lsquo;highly theoretical&rsquo; model of
the world proposed by theistic Sankhya. He mentions specifically the
need for &lsquo;a stronger empirical basis&rsquo; for explaining &lsquo;the
relationship between the <I>gunas</I> and the laws of nature&rsquo;
(p. 58). Perhaps a stronger empirical basis for the relation of body
and consciousness would also prove beneficial, allowing Edelmann to
appropriate more fully Peacocke&rsquo;s notion of God as improvising
musician&mdash;an apt enough metaphor in ISKCON&rsquo;s case given
the fame of Krishna as flute-player&mdash;thereby allowing for a more
robust acceptance of methodological naturalism. The qualified
theistic methodological naturalism proposed in Edelmann&rsquo;s
essay, intriguing as it may be, seems destined to exacerbate, rather
than lessen, conflict with contemporary science.</p>
