<blockquote>
  <p><em>Can a scholar be a true believer? Can a
    believer be a good scholar? Two parts of a problem that has exercised
    many in the West since at least the Enlightenment. Prof. Keith Ward,
    Regius Professor Emeritus of Divinity at the University of Oxford,
    takes a fresh look at the conundrum by examining some of the main
    problems and outlining a few principles that may help modern-day
    devotee-scholars.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Religion calls for total commitment and
faith. Scholarship calls for critical reasoning and a questioning of
all presuppositions. How then can religious devotion and academic
scholarship live together, even in the same person?</p>
<p>It may seem impossible. There are those
who say that simple faith is enough, and scholarship is a distraction
from a life of devotion. There are others who say that the study of
religions requires a lack of commitment, so that you can be
dispassionate and detached about whatever findings you come up with.
Are devotees who become scholars thus doomed to religious
schizophrenia, with two halves of their minds, the committed and the
sceptical, condemned never to meet?</p>
<p><strong>Must critical reasoning lead to
scepticism?</strong></p>
<p>I have taught philosophy in British and
American universities for forty years, and I have been a Christian
devotee for thirty of them, and I have to say that it has sometimes
felt that way. It is easy to be sceptical about other people&rsquo;s
faiths, but it is quite hard to be sceptical about your own. Anyway,
why should you be sceptical? Can you not have a form of education
that is purely affirming, and supports your faith?</p>
<p>In tackling questions like this, it
must first be asked whether the use of critical reason is bound to
lead to scepticism. It does not do so in physics, and that might be a
good place to start thinking about the problem.</p>
<p><em>Learning the fundamentals</em></p>
<p>In physics, it would be totally false
to say that everyone is encouraged from the start to criticise
everything they hear. No, Newton&rsquo;s laws are just true, and if
any first year student tried to criticise them they would be thrown
out of the class. The laws have been confirmed by thousands of
observations and experiments and never disconfirmed (at least at
speeds much less than the speed of light, and at magnitudes much
greater than that of atoms). They are the basis of modern science,
and students just have to learn them.</p>
<p>That is perhaps the first important
point to make. Before you can criticise anything, you must have a
great deal of correct information. If you are looking at physics, you
need to learn the laws and equations of the great physicists, to know
how to apply them and what they do and do not say. So, if you are
looking at religion, you need to know what devotees believe, what
significance those beliefs have for their lives, and what they do and
do not imply about the world.</p>
<p>At this stage there is no threat to
religious belief. Unfortunately, teachers of religion are sometimes
so ill-informed that misleading information is given, and a great
deal of prejudice can be conveyed. It is possible but quite difficult
for someone who does not believe in rebirth to give a sensitive
account of that doctrine. All too often over-simple accounts are
given, and the teacher does not have the information or experience to
know when the doctrine is much more sophisticated than the simple
versions that are often found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<I>Skilful means&rsquo;</I></p>
<p>This suggests a second point, that the
information given must be suited to the intelligence or insight of
the student, it must be at an appropriate level of sophistication,
and the teacher must be able to identify the points at which it is
being simplified to suit its audience, and at which more subtle
doctrines exist that cannot as yet be meaningfully conveyed.</p>
<p>Again there is a parallel in physics,
where quantum theory would never be taught to schoolchildren, yet
teachers should be able to convey that it does exist, so that things
are not as simple as the way they are forced to put them in primary
school. Buddhists often apply the principle of &lsquo;skilful means&rsquo;,
which says that you teach in a way that is best calculated to give an
appropriate level of insight to the pupils. It is not that something
is being concealed. It is just that some things can be beyond the
understanding of pupils, and it is important to know just where
simplifications are being made, even though what is being said is
appropriate at a certain level of knowledge. As a matter of fact,
when I just remarked that Newton&rsquo;s laws were true, I was doing
just that!</p>
<p>One of the main problems with religious
education is that this principle of skilful means is not properly
conveyed, so people with very simple understandings of religious
doctrines wrongly think that what they believe is the absolute truth.
This is where one problem between scholars and devotees can arise.
Many devotees have no inclination or ability to engage in abstract
thought about religious doctrines. They want to be wholly devoted to
their Lord, without understanding abstruse points about rebirth or
the nature of the self.</p>
<p>Of course they are absolutely right in
saying that there is no IQ test for the attainment of liberation. For
most faiths, liberation is by faith and moral commitment, not by the
ability to pass an examination in theology. Yet it would be quite
wrong to say that there are no intellectual truths in religion, or
that it does not matter if nobody understands them.</p>
<p>All devotees depend on the insight of
the primary gurus and teachers of their paths. They do not discover
all spiritual truths for themselves, or ever attain to complete
wisdom and understanding. Gurus have not obtained their
qualifications by passing examinations in theology. But then they do
not need to. They have immediate insight and transcendent wisdom, and
know things by personal apprehension that devotees can only learn
from them and dimly understand.</p>
<p>In physics, truths are discovered by
observation and experiment. The physicist learns to observe closely
and with discrimination, and to set up experiments that will disclose
aspects of nature that are not always apparent in everyday life. In
religion, truths are discovered by experience and practical
experiments in living. Spiritual teachers have the ability to
experience spiritual reality and to discriminate between reality and
illusion. They live in ways that explore deep and intense
relationships to the Spirit, ways of meditation and prayer, and in
that way they apprehend aspects of spiritual life that are not
apparent in everyday life.</p>
<p><em>Pointing to the real purpose of
religion</em></p>
<p>There are similarities between ways of
discovering truths in physics and in religion, but there is one major
difference. Physicists are not inwardly changed by their discoveries,
and they deal with objects in a publicly observable world. Religious
teachers, however, are transformed by their experiences of Spirit,
and they are raised to higher levels of existence by their relation
to a reality that is most real but difficult to find.</p>
<p>Scholarship will not raise anyone to
such levels of wisdom and sanctity. But what it can do is to raise
our understanding of spiritual truths, which will always be
inadequate, slightly higher. So a third principle of religious
scholarship, in addition to receiving correct information about
religious beliefs, and realising the points at which such information
is inadequate to full understanding, is that it should point to the
source of such information in the authoritative teaching of the
founders of the tradition, and be concerned to understand that
teaching as a source of personal insight and development. There
should, in other words, be sensitivity to the real purpose of
religion, which is the transformation of individual life by growth in
knowledge of the Supreme Lord, or of that which is of ultimate
reality and value. Any religious education that lacks that element is
like a course in music that fails to get anyone to appreciate the
beauty of music. Perhaps some courses in the study of religion are
like that. But there is no reason why scholarship should lead to
indifference. Scholars of music should love and appreciate music even
more than other people, and if they do not, something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>So religious scholarship should teach
us more about our religious beliefs; it should teach us humility as
we see the inadequacy of our intellects before the mysteries of the
spiritual realm, and it should increase our love and appreciation for
the teachings we embrace and for the teacher from whom they come.
Religious scholarship is only for those who have the inclination and
ability to pursue it. But for them it can be a religious duty.</p>
<p><strong>Three challenges</strong></p>
<p>It sounds as if the problem of being a
scholar and a devotee has faded away. But things are not that easy!
The sixteenth century in Europe saw the birth of three major cultural
forces that raised the problem in a very pointed way. First, the rise
of the natural sciences introduced new standards of precision in the
observation of the natural world, and aimed to bring all phenomena
under absolute and apparently inflexible laws of nature. Second, the
rise of critical history introduced a stress on careful scrutiny of
the evidence for all assertions about the past, and scepticism about
the accuracy of ancient historical records. Third, an insistence that
all traditional moral rules should stand before the bar of reason,
and justify themselves in terms of human flourishing, threw doubt on
many traditional moral attitudes that were often associated with
religious traditions.</p>
<p>I will consider each of these in turn,
and examine the problems they raise for religious believers. In each
case, those problems threaten any easy relationship between critical
scholarship and religious commitment, and it is not easy to find a
way of enabling scholarship and devotion to live together.</p>
<p><em>The whole truth?</em></p>
<p>Over the past three hundred years or
so, scientific knowledge has transformed our world. Modern medicine,
computers, aircraft and electricity have all changed the world to an
immense extent. Science works. It has given rise to a view of the
universe that is often presented something like this: the universe
originated with a Big Bang about fourteen thousand million years ago.
By a long process of cosmic evolution, organic life, in the form of
bacteria, formed on earth about four thousand million years ago, and
human beings evolved from them a few million years ago. In about five
thousand million years the sun will expand as it dies, and the earth
will be swallowed up in fire. Eventually the whole physical universe
will die, as the second law of thermodynamics inexorably takes
effect. Between the birth and death of the universe, all things
proceed in accordance with a few simple and elegant laws of nature,
and human beings are complex physical organisms that are, like
everything else, products of these laws, and not separate spiritual
souls. All that we are and love&mdash;beauty, morality, thought, and
friendship&mdash;is part of a long impersonal and purposeless
interplay of blind unconscious atoms, and will eventually subside
into the chaos from which it originated, leaving no physical trace.</p>
<p>This view clearly conflicts with most
religious beliefs and their account of the history of the universe
and the place of humans within it. Particular points of conflict lie
in the question of whether human life has developed by random
mutation from purely physical causes, whether human souls are more
than physical entities, whether miracles or spiritual causes for
physical events exist, and whether human life in the universe has any
significance.</p>
<p>There is one basic conflict underlying
all of these questions, and that is whether science allows any
reality other than the physical to exist and to play a causal role in
the way things happen. As a matter of fact the natural sciences do
not have much, if anything, to say on this issue. It is important to
distinguish what is established in the sciences by observation and
experiment from philosophical views that may be suggested by the
sciences, but are not themselves scientific&mdash;like the one just
presented.</p>
<p>Some religious views deny that the
evolution of life on earth happened at all. That is a major conflict,
and such believers will have to hold that many of the conclusions of
modern science are mistaken. This, however, is not such a major
problem as it may at first seem. All scientific theories are
provisional. They are based on the best evidence available, but they
do not claim absolute finality. Newton&rsquo;s laws came to be
supplemented by Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, and modern
quantum theory may yet be replaced by some theory that manages to
unite relativity and quantum theories more coherently. The theory of
evolution is accepted by the vast majority of scientists as the best
available explanation of the diversity of life on earth, and as a
very satisfactory way of accounting for all sorts of observed data
(like the existence of fossils). But it could be wrong. What those
who disagree with it can do is just what Isaac Newton did, and say &lsquo;I
frame no hypotheses&rsquo;. In his case, he discovered the inverse
square law of gravity, but could not accept what gravity seemed to
imply, that there was action at a distance. His law worked, but he
just had no theory about how it worked. So a biologist could accept
all testable predictions and repeatable observations in biology, but
simply frame no hypotheses about how organisms developed long before
any observations could be made and tested. Such a biologist could
simply remain agnostic about that, preferring to wait for further
evidence to come in, and proceed quite happily with observable and
testable facts in biology.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, most religious
believers, like people in general, feel that though the theory of
evolution is provisional, there is enough cumulative evidence for it
to be accepted as a well established scientific theory. In that case,
some amendments will have to be made to some traditional religious
views. In the Christian case, the Biblical account of creation in six
days will have to be interpreted as metaphorical and poetic, not as
literally true. And some Christian doctrines will need to be
reformulated in this new scientific context. Indian religious
traditions can do much the same thing. This is not too big a step,
for everyone agrees that there is a great deal of poetry and metaphor
in ancient religious traditions anyway. All that is needed is to
distinguish accounts of the origin and nature of the physical world,
which now becomes the province of natural science, from accounts of
spiritual truth, which is the real business of religion. It is
sometimes quite difficult to say exactly where this line should be
drawn. But many religious believers (the Roman Catholic Church, for
example) agree that religion has to accept the best findings of
science on matters of physical fact.</p>
<p>At the same time, religion has the
right to insist on the reality of the spiritual and its influence on
the physical world. So believers should reject any claims that there
is no purpose in the universe, that everything happens by blind
chance, or that physical laws of nature explain absolutely everything
that happens. These claims do not properly belong to science. They
are forms of a highly dubious philosophy, the philosophy of
materialism.</p>
<p>Since science deals only with the
material, it is not surprising that it does not mention any spiritual
factors&mdash;they lie outside the province of science. But it does
not follow that the spiritual does not exist, and it may seem very
improbable that only science can give the truth about the universe.
If there are spiritual truths about the universe, they will not be
discovered by science, but by spiritual insight. So there is much
room for debate about just what the relation between the spiritual
and the physical is. Science cannot dogmatically discount the
spiritual, but there are many problems about how science and the
spiritual relate to one another. Where is the spirit at work in
evolution? And how does the spiritual influence the physical?</p>
<p>These problems, like the problem of how
exactly the physical brain relates to human consciousness, may not be
solvable with our present knowledge. They may not be solvable by
humans at all. So, while the devotee who studies science will come
across many materialist viewpoints, those viewpoints can be readily
distinguished from the actual experimental findings of science. There
is no necessity for the believer to be able to resolve all the
puzzles of spirit-matter relationships in order to continue
believing. But it is a good thing to admit that they are puzzles.
Believers do not have all the answers, any more than scientists do.
Both religious believers and scientists need to cultivate humility,
try to see the limits of their expertise, and accept that many
intellectual problems have no solution in the present state of
knowledge.</p>
<p>Buddhists see presently insoluble
problems of a theoretical sort as &lsquo;unprofitable questions&rsquo;.
It does not matter to your spiritual life whether the universe began
or did not begin, whether human life evolved or did not evolve.
Profitable questions are questions that have consequences for the
attainment of the spiritual goal&mdash;a goal of inner peace,
equanimity, non-attachment, freedom from hatred, greed and delusion,
and devotion to a supreme Lord or a supreme good. If you thought that
science showed there was no supreme Lord (because everything is
physical), or that you could never achieve liberation from illusion
(because there are no spiritual states), then there would be a major
conflict between science and spiritual life. But these are just the
things science cannot show. Therefore the very real problems of
mind-matter interaction and of purpose in evolution are
&lsquo;unprofitable&rsquo; from a spiritual point of view.</p>
<p>That does not mean you should not try
to tackle them. If you have the inclination and ability, you should
try to tackle them. The attempt to do so may bring new insights and
help others who are troubled by these sorts of problems. But it does
mean that not everybody need concern themselves with such problems,
that we should not be discouraged if we cannot solve them, and that
it is reasonable to have faith that there is a solution, even if it
is not known to us.</p>
<p>The reason why at least some devotees
should study science is that it increases human understanding of the
world. Truth is indivisible, and any study that leads to a greater
understanding of truth is a proper spiritual pursuit for those whose
vocation it is. There is no conflict between the findings of natural
science and spiritual truth, as long as you approach both with a
certain humility, and bear in mind the proper subject matter of
science&mdash;understanding the nature of the physical world and its
laws&mdash;and of spirituality&mdash;seeking a transforming
relationship with a supreme spiritual reality. Devotees who are
scientific scholars will have a keener eye than most for what is
really established by scientific evidence, for the point at which
supposedly neutral theories are sometimes affected by assumptions,
religious or anti-religious, that are not strictly scientific, and
for the limitations of human rationality and knowledge. They will
also see the scientific exploration of the universe as part of seeing
more clearly the glory and wisdom of the Supreme Source of all
reality. The believer will often need patience, humility, and
faith&mdash;patience to put up with unsolved, yet spiritually
unprofitable, puzzles; humility to accept the provisionality of human
knowledge; and faith to trust, on non-scientific grounds, in the
supreme spiritual ground of all being.</p>
<p><I>History or mythology?</I></p>
<p>The problems involved in being a
devotee and a scientist do not seem too severe after all. Things get
more difficult, however, when devotees get involved in the critical
study of history. This is the area where sacred texts are viewed with
the same critical questions about authorship, accuracy, and
reliability as any other historical document. And it is where the
wide range of human beliefs throughout history and throughout the
whole planet becomes vividly apparent. If your own sacred texts are
treated by a historian just like any one else&rsquo;s sacred texts,
you are liable to find much of them regarded as myth or legend, as
exaggeration or fabrication. And if your present beliefs are shown to
be just a small part of a whole range of the constantly changing
religious beliefs of humanity, most of which make the same claims to
revealed status as yours, you may have difficulty in maintaining the
unique and absolute truth of your beliefs. This is the area in which
Christians have encountered most difficulties in the last one hundred
and fifty years or so. Those difficulties exist for all religious
traditions, but it just happens that, since many Europeans were
Christians, that is where the problems were most sharply focussed.</p>
<p>One place to begin confronting this
difficulty is to remember that no one speaks from a position of
religious neutrality. Everybody begins by thinking that some claims
about spiritual reality are true and some are false. So the devotee
is in just the same position as, say, the atheist. They both begin
from assumptions about the truth or falsity of many religious
beliefs.</p>
<p>Devotees affirm as part of their
experience an apprehension of a supreme spiritual reality that has
real and beneficial effects on their lives and on the lives of those
around them. This is not a historical assertion. It is an assertion
about present experience, about the way you see the world, and about
the supreme reality and value of the spiritual. Atheists will not
share this view, and that means that their interpretation of the
past, like their interpretation of the present, will exclude the
spiritual from consideration. All allegedly spiritual presences in
the past will be re-interpreted by atheists as illusions, having
purely social or psychological causes. In other words, devotees are
right to be suspicious of atheistic interpretations of the past.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as neutral
history, since history consists in finding the most probable
explanations of past events, and what you think is probable depends
on your initial beliefs. So any accounts of miraculous events&mdash;events
that are spiritually caused, that transcend the normal regularities
of physical events, and that carry a spiritual meaning&mdash;are
bound to be interpreted by atheists as legends. If, on the other
hand, there is a spiritual reality, it is rather likely that some
miracles will occur. Devotees are right to trust their sacred texts,
if there is reason to think they have been given by a person with
unique knowledge of spiritual reality. There is still much to learn
from atheistic historians, for they may point out aspects of events
that have been overlooked, and they may help you to distinguish
interpretations of your tradition that are less spiritually
profitable than others. But there is no reason to think that what
they say is the one correct version of events.</p>
<p>It is important to realise, however,
that there is not just one obvious version of historical events.
Muslims and Christians, for example, differ about whether Jesus was
crucified. Jews and Christians differ about whether Jesus ascended
into heaven. Hindus and Christians differ about whether Jesus was the
only divine incarnation, or sometimes about whether he was a divine
incarnation at all. This seems sufficient to show that there is not
just one account of religious history that every person of good will
would, if rational and pious, accept.</p>
<p>It is not quite enough to say that I
will just stick to my tradition and ignore all the others. I need to
know why others do not accept my tradition, and why there are so many
different traditions. The hard thing for a devotee is to remain
committed to your tradition&mdash;to be loyal to the personal
experience you have received, and the relationship to the Supreme
that you enjoy&mdash;yet also to be open to learn from very different
perspectives on human experience. We would all agree that, when we
begin our spiritual journey, there is little that we understand about
spiritual things. Can we increase our understanding by confining our
knowledge to just the one tradition in which we began? Well, yes, of
course we can increase it. But if we do that, and only do that, there
is an immense amount of knowledge about the world we will never have.
How do we know that we are not missing something of enormous value?
It seems arrogant to think that only our tradition has the truth,
that there is no truth anywhere else, and that we cannot benefit from
other viewpoints. How could we even know that without knowing
something about other traditions? Since there is no neutral view, it
is right to start from where we stand, in our tradition. But it is
reasonable to seek to extend our understanding as widely as possible,
and that should help us to see what is importantly true in our
tradition, and what may turn out to be due to historical accident or
even prejudice, and might need amending.</p>
<p>This can give rise to tensions in
personal life, if we really face up to the very different
understandings of others, which can often challenge our own. But
there is a huge difference between the deep and unchanging truth of a
tradition and the cultural forms and conventional interpretations
that we may have accepted unthinkingly. The distinctive truth of our
tradition may not change, but often our understanding of it should
change, and many things that we had thought a central part of our
tradition may turn out to be temporary forms, suited to earlier
understandings, but now in need of restatement.</p>
<p>Critical scholarship can thus serve
devotion, by helping us to distinguish central truths from culturally
conditioned forms, and by enabling us to see our tradition in a wider
historical context. But for that to happen, if you are a devotee you
must follow three principles. You must not be emotionally attached to
every particular form and statement that has come to you in your
tradition. You must identify with care the central experiences and
beliefs to which you are fundamentally committed, and distinguish
them from culturally influenced interpretations and practices. And
you must be committed to extending your understanding of truth as
widely as you can, whatever the consequences. Openness to the truth
requires a preparedness to revise views that come to seem false,
however attached to them we are. But this does not mean there are no
absolute commitments. Devotion to truth is itself a sort of spiritual
commitment, since what the devotee worships is the truth, usually in
personal form. And if it is the truth, no honest examination can
undermine it. We must remember the weakness of our intellects,
however, and this means that we should not give up our spiritual
commitment just because of some intellectual puzzle or perplexity.</p>
<p>This requires a degree of spiritual
maturity, a resolution often to live with uncertainty and even doubt,
but with a passionate commitment to the highest spiritual truth we
have discerned, and a determination not to let complex and difficult
theories undermine the most important spiritual experiences that
shape our lives. In this way the devotee can embrace historical
scholarship, however critical, as an aid to the discovery of truth,
though not as the ultimate arbiter of spiritual truth.</p>
<p><I>Authority, morality</I></p>
<p>The third main cultural force that
derives from the European Enlightenment is the stress on moral
autonomy, the principle that you should make your own moral
decisions, and not accept them on authority. I suppose many of us
would now say that the Enlightenment writers who espoused this
principle, like Immanuel Kant, were much too optimistic about human
nature. They thought that everyone would decide on the same set of
moral principles. Experience has shown, however, that humans will
make very different decisions about how to live. They may even decide
that they do not care what other people think, but will maximise
their own pleasure.</p>
<p>This is not at all what Kant had in
mind. What he was really concerned about was that moral rules should
be justifiable rationally. That is, they should be seen to be
conducive to human well-being, as opposed to being just absolute
commands that cannot be seen to have any rational point. Religious
devotees, however (and Kant was not a devotee), see ultimate human
well-being as lying in a relation of devotion, submission or loving
obedience to a Supreme Lord. The rules of religion spell out the way
in which that is best pursued in human life. Such rules may not be
rational to an atheist, but they are supremely important to a
believer.</p>
<p>It is true that such rules should not
be repressive, and that they should not infringe the freedom of
humans to choose their own course of action, as long as it does not
harm others. So believers must ask themselves if the moral rules they
subscribe to are harming others in subtle ways, or if they are
sometimes relics of ancient cultural conventions that cannot be
justified either on grounds of widening human freedom and
responsibility or of pointing the way towards the ultimate religious
goal.</p>
<p>So in matters of conduct and morality
the devotee should not fear the most ruthless critical examination.
Religion is concerned with the ultimate good for humans, and with the
nature of that good. It therefore has an interest in examining as
carefully as possible the principles that make for such good. It
particularly needs to ask why its rules and practices are so often
destructive, intolerant, and oppressive of others. Such investigation
may sometimes be uncomfortable, since devotees tend to be rather
conservative in their moral views. What needs to be discovered is how
far such conservatism is rooted merely in traditionalism for its own
sake, and how far it can be justified in the light of the real goal
of human good that a religious tradition enjoins. Again, the devotee
needs to balance a practical commitment to a spiritual journey with
an intellectual openness that may challenge accepted practices and
interpretations. But that is just what all great religious teachers
have embodied&mdash;an unflinching commitment to the supreme good,
with a very critical attitude to many current social norms and
conventions. In the end the devotee will not completely agree with
the slogan, &lsquo;Decide for yourself what moral principles to
follow&rsquo;. Most humans do not have the wisdom and insight for
that. But the devotee will agree that all moral principles accepted
on authority continually need to be tested against their efficacy in
promoting human well-being and the ultimate good for all sentient
beings. For that is, after all, what enlightened religious teachers
have always taught.</p>
<p><B>Concluding thoughts</B></p>
<p>Is it, after all, difficult to be a
scholar and a devotee? It may seem so, if reason is seen as the enemy
of faith, and if reason is seen as purely critical and destructive of
belief. But reason also has a constructive role to play in showing
the coherence and plausibility of beliefs. Its criticisms are
necessary to distinguish superstition and mere convention from wisdom
and truth.</p>
<p>It can feel difficult to face the
criticisms of others, especially when we cannot think of arguments to
defend our own position. We can be almost overwhelmed by the sheer
amount of information the modern world offers, and that can shake our
confidence.</p>
<p>But the spiritual approach is to let
the arguments flow where they will, and to absorb as much information
as we can, but to continue our spiritual practice with resolution. It
is rather as if someone who is deeply in love is also a psychologist
investigating the nature of love. That person will gather as much
information as possible and will listen to as many views and
arguments as possible. None of that will affect the fact of being in
love, though some of it may affect the ways in which that love is
expressed.</p>
<p>So it is with religious faith. It is
part of spiritual practice that we should be non-attached to the
arguments that flow around and through us, but should view them like
the thoughts and feelings that pass in meditation. We should maintain
a calm confidence that truth will never contradict that supreme Real
who is Truth, even if we are not very good at getting access to the
truth. Our task is to try to discover more of the truth, without
attachment to our success or depression at our failure. Seek the
truth but do not believe you have ever finally found it, exactly as
it really is. Embrace all criticisms, but never despair if you cannot
respond to them adequately. Always seek what is good and spiritually
useful in all the knowledge you acquire. And always sustain your
practical commitment to the highest good that you know&mdash;which,
for any devotee, will be the Supreme Good and the Ultimately Real. If
we can sustain such attitudes, scholarship will, for many of us, be
part of devotion, and there will be no schizophrenia&mdash;though
there will be many personal failures of coherence and
rationality&mdash;between the scholar and the devotee.</p>
