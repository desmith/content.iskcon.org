<blockquote>
  <p><em>Drawing on his
    experience in conflict resolution in ISKCON, Braja Bihari Dasa
    examines one of the core factors of conflict&mdash;the division
    between &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo;
    positions on the understanding and application of a shared set of
    teachings. He uses several models for understanding such conflict and
    from these he draws solutions that aim to enable conflict to be
    resolved, where appropriate, or to be acknowledged for their
    potential to form the basis of healthy, productive dialogue.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Srila Prabhupada, the founder of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), often
voiced concern about internal conflicts in his growing ISKCON
society:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have
    so much work to do, we cannot lose our solidarity. Do not cause a
    crack there with any fighting spirit or competition. Whenever I hear
    complaints or disturbances in our centres my mind becomes [. . .]
    disturbed and I cannot properly translate my books. So please spare
    me from such disturbance by cooperating all together, Godbrothers and
    Godsisters. (Srila Prabhupada letter to Malati, 7
    January 1974)</p>
  <p>You
    have dedicated your life for Krsna and therefore you should be ideal.
    We are introducing Krsna Consciousness movement for the harmony and
    good will of humanity. But if you yourselves are suffering from the
    very ills we are trying to remove, how can the people be influenced
    favourably? Stop this fighting, tolerate. (Srila Prabhupada
    letter to Trivikrama, 1 May 1974)</p>
  <p>Only
    after exhausting every possibility of peaceful solution shall we
    fight anyone. Just like Krsna. He did not call for fighting until
    after every chance for settlement failed. (Srila Prabhupada
    letter to Balavanta, 13 December 1972)
    <!-- Shouldn’t this be “(Letter to: Balavanta, Ahmedabad, 13 December, 1972)” ? I don’t like these numbers… Or? -->
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This
paper analyses some of the causes of conflict in ISKCON,
particularly, as the title suggests, in the conservative/liberal
realm. Should ISKCON stick to tradition as closely as possible or can
we adapt Krsna
consciousness to the surrounding culture when appropriate: Can we
offer Krsna
vegetarian pizzas or must we only offer traditional items such as
pakoras? The paper ends by offering a number of solutions in keeping
with Prabhupada&rsquo;s desire for cooperation in his Society.</p>
<p><B>Causes
of conflict</B></p>
<p>There
are many causes of conflict. In his book, <I>The Mediation Process</I>,
Christopher Moore outlines the main ones (pp. 64&ndash;5):</p>
<ol>
  <li><B>Value</B>
    conflicts: caused by parties having different criteria to evaluate
    ideas, or by different lifestyles, ideologies, or religions.</li>
  <li><B>Relationship
    </B>conflicts: caused by strong emotions, misperceptions,
    miscommunications, and regular, negative interactions.</li>
  <li><B>Data
    </B>conflicts: caused by a lack of information, different
    interpretations of data, and different views on what is relevant.</li>
  <li><B>Interest
    </B>conflicts: caused by competition over substantive interests,
    procedural interests, or psychological interests.</li>
  <li><B>Structural
    </B>conflicts: caused by destructive patterns of behaviour, unequal
    control and ownership of resources, unequal power and authority,
    time constraints, and geographical/environmental factors that hinder
    cooperation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moore
suggests interventions for each of these sources of conflict. As
Arnold Zack mentioned in an article for <I>ISKCON Communications
Journal </I>(Vol. 10), organisations worldwide are recognising the
need to address such conflicts and are finding promising results from
their foray into Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Zack describes
the way ISKCON has begun a programme to deal with cases of conflict
within the organisation. Without repeating his detailed article, I
would like to further explore conflicts as they relate to religious
organisations, and of course, as they apply specifically to ISKCON,
and even more specifically, between conservative and liberal
viewpoints in ISKCON.</p>
<p>In
<I>Managing Church Conflict,</I> Hugh F. Halverstadt adds to Moore&rsquo;s
list by citing three causes of conflict particular to church settings
(p. 2). Of particular interest to this discussion is Halverstadt&rsquo;s
first point: Church conflicts are intense because we have attached
our commitment and faith to them. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For one
    thing, parties&rsquo; core identities are at risk in church
    conflicts. Spiritual commitments and faith understandings are highly
    inflammable because they are central to one&rsquo;s psychological
    identity. When Christians differ over beliefs or commitments, they
    may question or even condemn one another&rsquo;s spirituality or
    character. Their self-esteem is on the line. (Halverstadt, p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps
more than the average churchgoer, ISKCON members make sacrifices and
major lifestyle changes when taking to Krsna
consciousness. They change how they eat, sleep, dress, and speak;
they develop new friendships and frequently relinquish the old; and
they develop a new set of life aspirations. To become devotees, they
also adopt a drastically different outlook on life from the one with
which they were raised. They invest a lot of themselves in becoming
Krsna&rsquo;s
devotee, and thus if aspects of their core identity are brought into
question by someone with a different point of view&mdash;especially
by someone in their own ranks&mdash;conflict often results.</p>
<p>There are a number
of factors that influence a devotee&rsquo;s &lsquo;take&rsquo; on
Krsna
consciousness. The first is cultural diversity. There are ISKCON
temples in 103 countries, and although they afford a basic uniformity
of theology and practices, the host cultures each bring in much
variety. Prabhupada infers this in one of his commentaries: &lsquo;A
candidate for Krsna consciousness in the Western countries should be
taught about the renunciation of material existence, but one would
teach candidates from a country like India in a different way. The
teacher (<I>acarya</I>) has to consider time, candidate and country.&rsquo;
(<I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</I>, Madhya-lila 23.105, purport)
Other significant differences in &lsquo;takes&rsquo; are caused by
devotees&rsquo; early training in Krsna consciousness, their level of
spiritual advancement, their <I>purva-samskaras</I> (mental
impressions from previous lives), their conditioning in this life,
their socio-economic status, their intellectual capacity, their
choice of friends, their habits, and more. Thus although all are
members of ISKCON, there is variety in how members perceive,
experience, teach, and practice Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Understanding
how that variety manifests is an essential tool in analysing ISKCON&rsquo;s
conflicts and coping with the confusion those conflicts create. Srila
Prabhupada was fond of quoting the Sanskrit saying, <I>atmavan
manyate jagat</I>, &lsquo;I think like this, so the whole world must
also think in the same way&rsquo;. Ross and Ward of Stanford
University give a detailed outline of a similar concept (pp. 110&ndash;11).
They coin the phrase &lsquo;na&iuml;ve realism&rsquo;, and describe
the concept as follows:</p>
<OL>
	<LI><p>That
	I see entities and events as they are in objective reality, and that
	my social attitudes, beliefs, preferences, priorities, and the like
	follow from a relatively dispassionate, unbiased and essentially
	&lsquo;unmediated&rsquo; apprehension of the information or evidence
	at hand.</p>
	<LI><p>That
	other rational social perceivers generally will share my reactions,
	behaviour and opinions&mdash;provided they have had access to the
	same information that gave rise to my views, and provided that they
	too have processed that information in a reasonably thoughtful, and
	open-minded fashion.</p>
	<LI>That the failure of a given
	individual or group to share my views arises from one of three
	possible sources:    
</OL>
<ul>
  <li>The individual or group in
    question may have been exposed to a different sample of information
    than I was (in which case, provided that the other party is
    reasonable and open-minded, the sharing or pooling of information
    should lead us to reach an agreement);</li>
  <li>The individual or group in
    question may be lazy, irrational, or otherwise unable or unwilling
    to proceed in a normative fashion from objective evidence to
    reasonable conclusions; or</li>
  <li>The individual or group in
    question may be biased (either in interpreting the evidence or in
    proceeding from evidence to conclusions) by ideology, self-interest,
    or some other distorting personal influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I
prefer the term &lsquo;subjective realism&rsquo; to the more
pejorative &lsquo;na&iuml;ve realism&rsquo;; for me, &lsquo;na&iuml;ve&rsquo;
tends to make this syndrome sound undesirable. Rather, thinking in
these ways is natural&mdash;it is clear that this influence is
frequently at work in most people&rsquo;s lives&mdash;the only
undesirable part is when we don&rsquo;t recognise it in others or
ourselves. Indeed, if we look at Moore&rsquo;s five causes of
conflict, it&rsquo;s reasonable to say that subjective realism can
play a part in nearly all of them. We see the world differently from
others, and we are often willing to enter into a dispute because of
that. ISKCON members are no exception.</p>
<p>It is
important to clarify that when applying these considerations in
ISKCON, I&rsquo;m not implying that the standard spiritual truths
mentioned in Vaisnava<I> sastra</I> (scripture) are up for subjective
reinterpretation. Clearly ISKCON has a standard theology to which all
its members must adhere if they are to be considered members at all.
Similarly, Srila Prabhupada has established certain incontrovertible
standards, including the initiation vows (no illicit sex, no
gambling, no intoxication, and no eating of meat, fish, or eggs, and
the promise to chant at least sixteen rounds of the Hare Krsna
<I>maha-mantra </I>a day). In fact, these common understandings held
by all ISKCON devotees are essential and will be discussed later as a
possible means to overcoming differences.</p>
<p>Thus,
although I use the terms &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo;,
it should be clear that (1) these terms are used in relation to
non-core practice and that each party would agree on the core ISKCON
theology, and (2) these terms are used relative to ISKCON practices
(even the &lsquo;liberals&rsquo; would generally be considered highly
conservative by current Western standards).</p>
<p>Still<!-- Comma here? -->
even within this narrow definition there is plenty of room for
individual emphasis, interpretation, and realisation&mdash;based on
spiritual inspiration, practical and material considerations, and a
combination of these. Differences arise, ignited by subjective
realism and stoked by the age we live in.</p>
<p><B>The
argument culture and Kali-yuga</B></p>
<p>The
Vaisnava <I>sastra</I> (scripture) repeatedly explains that we are
now living in the age of Kali, of quarrel. This is a time when people
all too easily enter into conflict. Although conflict is inevitable
in this age, how a person or organisation deals with it marks the
difference between that person&rsquo;s ability to excel or simply
limp along. Spiritual organisations, although meant to be reservoirs
of peace, are not exempt from this influence. Indeed, for all the
reasons stated above and more, religious groups have long histories
of quarrel. Even a relatively new institution like ISKCON has already
built conflict into its history. In her book, <I>The Argument
Culture</I>, Deborah Tannen explains how this tendency towards
quarrel is affecting today&rsquo;s society: &lsquo;. . . conflicts
can sometimes be resolved without confrontational tactics, but
current conventional wisdom often devalues less confrontational
tactics even if they work well, favouring more aggressive strategies
even if they get less favourable results. It&rsquo;s as if we value a
fight for its own sake, not for its effectiveness in resolving
disputes&rsquo; (p. 23).</p>
<p>Kali-yuga&rsquo;s
beginnings seem to exemplify this tendency. In <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>
we have the story of Srngi, an unqualified son of a <I>brahmana</I>,
cursing the great devotee-king Pariksit to die within seven days
after the king had apparently offended Srngi&rsquo;s father when the
<I>brahmana </I>did not offer him a proper reception. While this
particular event is viewed as the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement meant to
bring about the speaking of the <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>, it is also
said that Kali-yuga&rsquo;s influence began when Srngi chose an
aggressive strategy even though alternatives were certainly
available.</p>
<p>Kali
influences in another substantial way: it breaks down authority.
Tannen quotes Robert Bly who writes in <I>Sibling Society</I> that
present-day citizens &lsquo;. . . are like squabbling siblings with
no authority figures who can command enough respect to contain and
channel their aggressive impulses. It is as if every day is a day
with a substitute teacher who cannot control the class and maintain
order&rsquo; (Tannen, p. 25). When I joined ISKCON in 1977, the
authority structure was strong and firmly intact. After Prabhupada&rsquo;s
departure that year and the subsequent difficulties centred on
questionable leadership decisions and the moral shortcomings of some
of the renunciates, the authority structure has weakened
considerably. History is yet to reveal how well this weakened
structure will survive in ISKCON. Some say that ISKCON is doing
relatively well in keeping the Governing Body Commission intact, but,
for the present, ISKCON certainly suffers from the &lsquo;substitute
teacher syndrome&rsquo;. With a decrease in authority, opinions
proliferate with the understanding that one opinion is not better
than any other. Lack of strong authority encourages subjective
reality to run amok, resulting ultimately in more disagreements.</p>
<p><B>The
medium affects the message</B></p>
<p>Authority
is also weakened by the advent of desktop publishing and the
internet. Previously, if one wished to publish a book, he or she had
to convince an ISKCON publisher of its value&mdash;often a daunting
task. Now anyone with an idea, a computer, a printer, and a small
investment can publish a book.</p>
<p>Websites,
with their anyone-can-say-anything aspect, are even easier to
establish.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote51anc" HREF="#sdendnote51sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
It is a fact that many of the disagreements that take place in ISKCON
exist only in cyberspace; the devotees involved may not even have met
in person. The internet has connected us in ways never before
possible. It has also extended the influence of both subjective
realism and Kali-yuga beyond all boundaries: people can now send mail
to hundreds of receivers all over the world in a matter of seconds.
Furthermore, if we were to accept the popular statistic that 10% of
communication is in what we say, 30% is in how we say it, and the
final 60% revealed in our body language, then e-mail is clearly not a
useful tool for discussing topics that have emotional and
philosophical components. E-mail is quite useful for knowing when to
pick someone up at the airport or other innocuous dealings, but it is
not a fit medium for working out long-standing disagreements. For
example, recently the Executive Committee of ISKCON&rsquo;s Governing
Body Commission (GBC) was called upon to referee a complicated issue
involving the alleged misbehaviour of a regional leader. Over 1000
e-mails were exchanged on the subject with little progress but much
miscommunication and some ill feelings. Realising that e-mail was not
bringing the problem closer to a solution, the Executive Committee
chairman called a meeting of the involved parties. Within a short
time the problems were sorted out to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction.
While it&rsquo;s true that the meeting was much more costly in terms
of time and travel expenses and that the e-mails had cost nothing,
still, the meeting proved much more efficient in coming to a
solution. It also seems clear, however, that e-mail will continue to
fuel ISKCON&rsquo;s conflicts, despite its usually negative effects.</p>
<p>Another
technological hazard in ISKCON is the Vedabase, a searchable
compilation of all of Prabhupada&rsquo;s writings, letters, and
transcribed conversations. While it is a wonderful facility for a
researcher or a traveller who doesn&rsquo;t want to carry books (all
the books fit on one DVD), it has its downside. The front matter of
the Vedabase states, &lsquo;The Bhaktivedanta Vedabase is a powerful
tool, and like all tools it may be used either well or badly. Used
well, it can help us discover, gather, and bring to light many
teachings the scriptures and Srila Prabhupada give us. Used badly, it
can help assemble false evidence, fallacious arguments, and wrong
conclusions&rsquo;. All too often devotees approach the information
contained on the Vedabase with an agenda, and then use the Vedabase
to find quotes to confirm their prejudicial views. Rather than trying
to understand Prabhupada&rsquo;s statements and how they fit in with
his other statements and the scriptural conclusions, it seems that
many people only turn to the Vedabase to find ammunition in their
attempts to defeat others.</p>
<p><B>Conservative
and liberal</B></p>
<p>The
above-mentioned causes of conflict are best visible today in ISKCON
in a variety of conservative versus liberal conflicts. There are a
number of subjects affected by the conservative-liberal dichotomy,
including the role of women, ISKCON&rsquo;s relations with the wider
world, approaches to missionary activities, the usefulness of
interfaith dialogue, and the degree of inculcating traditional
culture.</p>
<p>At the
risk of over-generalising, here is a brief synopsis of the
viewpoints: liberals take an egalitarian approach to the role of
women based on the inherent equality of all souls on the spiritual
platform. They feel ISKCON needs to be relevant to the outside world
and that we can learn much from others. We should therefore be
creative in our missionary activities, adjusting them to time, place,
and circumstance. They also feel that the give-and-take of interfaith
dialogue is helpful for ISKCON and for others, and that while
cultural traditions are important, they are secondary to higher,
spiritual principles. Implementing a traditional culture in ISKCON,
they say, has to be done carefully, because previous attempts were
immature and left scars on those who were part of the attempt.</p>
<p>Conservatives
accept a complementarian approach to the role of women: women have a
distinctive role centred on being wives, mothers, and are in no way
competing with men. They believe we should give to the outside world
but that there is little we should take. While adjustments can be
made to the culture for outreach activities, we already have a
perfect, if yet to be fully implemented, culture; we need only
execute our teachings with faith. Conservatives believe we should be
wary of interfaith dialogue; after all, we already have the truth and
others should learn it from us. They believe we have little to gain
from others. We need only preach and exemplify the Vedic culture,
which is glorious&mdash;supremely so. The closer we come to following
it, the happier we will be, as will those who come in contact with
us.</p>
<p>Both
parties present evidence from <I>sastra</I> as well as examples from
Prabhupada&rsquo;s personal application of it to substantiate their
viewpoint. It may be that on some issues, based on <I>sastra</I>, one
party is right and the other wrong, but until now in ISKCON, neither
the liberal nor the conservative position has been established as
dominant, nor is that likely to happen in the near future. In the
ongoing debates, both continue to quote legitimate passages and
attempt to connect those passages to the present-day institution.</p>
<p><!-- Strange thing to say… Which sentence is he referring to? Maybe rephrase it so that it’s transpartent? --><B>An
example: the issue surrounding the role of women in ISKCON</B></p>
<p>What
is the role of women in ISKCON? Can women take leadership positions?
Can they be gurus? Should they rather play a complementary role to
men as pious wives and mothers protected by their fathers in youth,
their husbands in marriage, and their grown sons in old age? Much of
the contention in this conflict centres around hermeneutics: on how
ISKCON should interpret the scriptures and Prabhupada&rsquo;s
comments on them. What constitutes an unchangeable spiritual
principle? What constitutes a detail, a time-and-place attempt to
apply a principle that can be changed when time and place differ? Are
the cultural <I>varnasrama</I><SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote52anc" HREF="#sdendnote52sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
considerations a principle or a detail? What is to be done when two
parties emphasise different and apparently opposing principles?</p>
<p>Egalitarians
<!-- Not “liberals” to keep to clear? -->emphasise
the oneness of all souls and that bodily differences are of secondary
importance. <I>Bhakti</I>, loving devotion to Krsna,
is a function of the soul; it has nothing to do with the external
body one happens to inhabit. Men aren&rsquo;t men eternally, nor are
women eternally women. Egalitarians believe we should be evolved
enough to &lsquo;get off the bodily concept of life&rsquo; and
respect each other as souls, as eternal servants of Krsna.
We should be careful not to allow mundane concepts to enter a
spiritual society. Egalitarians quote passages from Prabhupada&rsquo;s
letters and writings like these:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding lecturing
    by women devotees: I have informed you that in the service of the
    Lord there is no distinction of caste, or creed, colour, or sex.
    (Srila Prabhupada letter to Jayagovinda, 8 February 1968)</p>
  <p>Sometimes
    jealous persons [from India] criticise the Krsna consciousness
    movement because it engages equally both men and women in
    distribution of love of Godhead. Not knowing that men and women in
    countries like Europe and America mix very freely, these fools and
    rascals criticise the boys and girls in Krsna
    consciousness for intermingling. But these rascals should consider
    that one cannot suddenly change a community&rsquo;s social customs.
    However, since both men and women are being trained to become
    preachers those women are not ordinary women but are as good as their
    brothers who are preaching Krsna
    consciousness.
    <!-- This is from: Cc. Adi 7.31-32, purport  -->
    Therefore
    it is a principle that a preacher must strictly follow the rules and
    regulations laid down in the <I>sastras </I>yet at the same time
    devise a means by which the preaching work to reclaim the fallen may
    go with full force. (<I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</I>,
    Adi-lila 7.38, purport)</p>

<p>The complementarians
protest the growing acceptance of a feminist agenda in ISKCON. They
fear the creeping in of a materialistic, left-wing mindset that runs
contrary to ISKCON&rsquo;s stated goals. ISKCON, which is based on an
ancient culture, is, they say, being influenced by modern,
materialistic considerations that run contrary to the <I>varnasrama</I>
ideal that ISKCON is meant to establish. While they certainly accept
the philosophical point that &lsquo;we are not these bodies&rsquo;,
they maintain that the <I>varnasrama</I> social norms are an
important vehicle for attaining the spiritual platform. They consider
<I>varnasrama </I>the support culture upon which the spiritual
Vaisnava culture will be built. They also feel that without the
support of this Vaisnava social model, we will by default embrace the
culture of Western hedonism, a culture that will not support our
spiritual aspirations. They cite scripture such as the following, to
support their points:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A chaste woman
    should not be greedy, but satisfied in all circumstances. She must be
    very expert in handling household affairs and should be fully
    conversant with religious principles. She should speak pleasingly and
    truthfully and should be very careful and always clean and pure. Thus
    a chaste woman should engage with affection in the service of a
    husband who is not fallen. (<I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I> 7.11.38)</p>
  <p>Women need to be
    protected by men. A woman should be cared for by her father in her
    childhood, by her husband in her youth, and by her grown sons in her
    old age. (<I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I> 6.18.42, purport)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The
role of women is a high profile issue. If it is handled with care,
respect, and sufficient attention, its resolution can go a long way
in giving ISKCON members confidence of their ability to overcome
differences and work cooperatively.</p>
<p><B>Pizza
or pakoras?</B></p>
<p>In
his article, &lsquo;Conflict in Groups: The Cross-Stitching Effect&rsquo;
(p. 247), Ron Kraybill discusses two different church congregations.
In one church, various members agree with one person on one issue and
another person on a different issue (see fig. 1<!-- Where is this? -->).
In one instance, A, B, C,  and D agree; on another A, B, F, and E;
and on a third A, B, G, and H. In the other church, members vote
according to party lines, consistently siding with the same people
(see fig. 2<!-- Where is this? -->).
Kraybill says that the first church paradoxically invites
disagreements, as they are dealt with respectfully and have an
outcome of bringing people closer together. The second church
generally avoids conflict, but when it arises the members become
polarised, which leads to politics, mistrust, misrepresentation of
views, and potentially a split.</p>

<p>I
presented these diagrams at a lecture entitled &lsquo;Pizza or
Pakoras&rsquo; in July 2004 at the ISKCON European Convention.
Looking at the diagram, someone in the audience said, &lsquo;Church
One looks like a pizza, Church Two looks like two pakoras, but which
one is ISKCON?&rsquo; I hadn&rsquo;t intended that this diagram to be
linked to my lecture&rsquo;s title, and the metaphor doesn&rsquo;t
fit exactly, but it got me thinking about the question: Which church
does ISKCON most resemble?</p>
<p>My
analysis, based on living in the heartbeat of ISKCON Vrndavana,
India, and dealing on a daily basis with ISKCON &lsquo;issues&rsquo;
as the director of ISKCONResolve,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote53anc" HREF="#sdendnote53sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
is that both Church One and Church Two scenarios exist in ISKCON.
However, because of ISKCON&rsquo;s diversity, members tend to lean
towards Church One despite the vocal minority entrenched in Church
Two dynamics as liberals or conservatives. The Church One people,
according to Kraybill, already deal with conflict in healthy ways.
The question remains as to how ISKCON can help its Church Two
liberals and conservatives deal with one another in mutually
satisfactory and beneficial ways?</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
<p><!-- Where’s “Part I” ? --><I>Increased
dialogue</I></p>
<p>Presently,
conservatives and liberals often communicate within their own groups
but do not engage in many constructive dialogues with devotees at the
other end of the spectrum. Inevitably this leads to misunderstandings
about the other&rsquo;s viewpoints and, especially, motives.
Straw-man positions are presented and attacked. Polarisation occurs
and positions harden. Miscommunication abounds. Ad hominem attacks&mdash;a
special tool for fuelling conflict and discouraging cooperation&mdash;are
not infrequent.</p>
<p>Dialogue
can go far to ameliorate the above scenario. A structured
dialogue&mdash;assisted by a neutral third-party&mdash;clarifies
intentions and viewpoints. Parties can hear one another respectfully.
Without dropping their own positions, they try to understand one
another. Dialogue separates the real issues from the perceived ones
and de-escalates the mistrust and fears shared between the parties. A
de-demonisation takes place, and the atmosphere becomes conducive for
empathic communications.</p>
<p>In the
case of ISKCON&rsquo;s conservatives and liberals, some steps are
being taken in this direction in the form of dialogue via an e-mail
conference. Because ISKCON is an international organisation and
in-person dialogue is not always possible between disputing parties,
we have conceded to setting up an e-mail conference despite the
risks. Also, the GBC has requested parties on both sides of the
&lsquo;women&rsquo;s issue&rsquo; to participate in a dialogue to
&lsquo;seek out possible resolutions for these contentious issues and
report back to the GBC body&rsquo;. When properly established,
dialogue is a powerful tool for ISKCON devotees. It is a primary
teaching in ISKCON to respect all others without requiring respect in
return. It has been my experience that dialogue becomes easy when the
disputants practice Vaisnava
humility.</p>
<p>Dialogue,
as a first step, is essential, and it can often lead to tangible
decision making. Jennifer Lynch coins the term &lsquo;D2D&rsquo;
(dialogue to decision). Often, by sincere dialogue divergent groups
come to conclusions on their own regarding how best to proceed with
the issues at hand. That may certainly happen on various topics
between ISKCON&rsquo;s conservatives and liberals. Further, I would
suggest ISKCON leadership look at the idea of allowing a variety of
positions on a given topic to be acceptable within ISKCON&rsquo;s
official stance. As Prabhupada once stated when writing to a GBC
member:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If we
    keep Krsna in the centre, then there will be agreement in varieties.
    This is called unity in diversity. I am therefore suggesting that all
    our devotees meet in Mayapur every year during the birth anniversary
    of Lord Caitanya. With all GBC and senior devotees present we should
    discuss how to make unity in diversity. But, if we fight on account
    of diversity, then it is simply the material platform. Please try to
    maintain the philosophy of unity in diversity. That will make our
    movement successful. (Srila Prabhupada letter to
    Kirtanananda, 18 October 1973)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much
conflict and politicking takes place among liberals and conservatives
in ISKCON because of an unwritten understanding that ISKCON will
accept only one view on a subject. Perhaps much of the energy spent
on each group trying to establish its view as <I>the</I> view could
be better spent on ISKCON&rsquo;s primary purposes&mdash;becoming
Krsna
conscious and helping others to do the same&mdash;and on living with
diversity on many of the less central issues. In offering this
suggestion I realise that we open up yet another contentious
question: What is a core issue and what is not? I still suggest,
however, that this question is easier to deal with than the
differences surrounding the issue <!-- Vague… Which issue? -->itself.</p>
<p><em>Systems approach</em></p>
<p>Since
Arnold Zack&rsquo;s article in the last <I>ISKCON Communications
Journal</I>, ISKCON&rsquo;s Alternative Dispute Resolution work has
developed and is moving towards what is called an Integrated Conflict
Management System (ICMS). ISKCONResolve, ISKCON&rsquo;s ICMS, offers
a spectrum of services to ISKCON devotees, including mediation,
dialogue, arbitration, conflict analysis, and an ombuds office<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote54anc" HREF="#sdendnote54sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>.
ISKCONResolve offers these choices so devotees can address their
concerns, complaints, conflicts, and suggestions in positive,
effective ways. In addition to facilitating the existing debates, it
provides conservatives and liberals with an effective, positive means
to be understood and heard both by one another and by ISKCON&rsquo;s
leadership. As Tannen concludes, &lsquo;There are times when we need
to disagree, criticise, oppose, and attack&mdash;to hold debates and
view issues as polarised battles. Even cooperation, after all, is not
the absence of conflict but a means of managing conflict. My goal is
not a make-nice false veneer of agreement or a dangerous ignoring of
true opposition. I&rsquo;m questioning the <I>automatic</I> use of
adversarial formats&mdash;the assumption that it&rsquo;s <I>always</I>
best to address problems and issues by fighting over them. I&rsquo;m
hoping for a broader repertoire of ways to talk to each other and
address issues vital to us.&rsquo; (p. 26) ISKCONResolve<I> </I>is an
attempt to offer that broader repertoire to its members.</p>
<p>Part of
the systems approach to conflict is &lsquo;capacity building&rsquo;
(Schirch), training members of an organisation in alternative methods
of dealing with conflict. ISKCONResolve has trained over four hundred
ISKCON devotees in mediation. That&rsquo;s a start, but now we are
developing a short seminar to be made available to a far larger
number of members. This shorter course will provide basic theory and
skills for individuals to address conflicts that arise in their
lives. The seminar will also include points on how they can take
advantage of the services ISKCONResolve has to offer. A course is
also being developed for use in schools and Sunday schools affiliated
with ISKCON.</p>
<p>Another
essential aspect of a systems approach is the follow-up. Sustained
cooperation and peace don&rsquo;t come easily. Disputants often
experience satisfaction with dialogue or mediation, but
disappointment when the actual changes turn out to be negligible
(Kraybill p. 69). Often we underestimate the amount of work needed to
resolve a dispute. Decisions need to be tested and communications
followed up. ISKCONResolve tries to follow up on a case as long as
required.</p>
<p><em>Returning to the essence</em></p>
<p>In May
2004 I was invited to speak at the Sunday school at the Park View
Mennonite Church in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Prior to my talk, I
attended the sermon of Phil Kniss, the Church&rsquo;s pastor. He
spoke of a significant schism in the Mennonite Church. I have to
admit that I was surprised to hear about this schism, because
Mennonites are famous for their interest in peace and their ability
to invoke it. I thus listened carefully as Kniss implored the
congregation to be wary of quick-fix, smiling-face solutions that
ignore the depths this conflict has reached. He said that as a Church
they have a duty to God to not simply deal superficially with this
crisis but to go to the roots of their faith in Jesus and find a
spiritual solution:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let me
    suggest, at the risk of being the bearer of bad news, that if <I>all</I>
    we do is help a church full of diverse people be friendly, get along
    with each other, and not fight very much, then we simply make church
    nothing more than a polite, neighbourly, social club. And we settle
    for a cheap substitute for Christian community. (Kniss p. 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately,
he prescribed transcendence of the conflict by singing the Lord&rsquo;s
praise: &lsquo;. . . if real unity in the church is ever going to be
achieved, it will happen when we get together and sing&rsquo; (Kniss
p. 10). I could relate to that. His sermon sparked my thoughts about
ISKCON and the need to transcend our differences by absorption in
things that bring us together: our devotion to Krsna
expressed through singing, dancing, feasting, worshipping, studying,
and serving together. Not only do these activities bring us together,
they are the essence of devotional service, and, according to all
Vaisnava
<I>sastra</I>, the most effective means of cleansing our hearts and
making them suitable to receive Krsna&rsquo;s instruction and
audience. These are superordinate practices (practices we can all
agree on and work together to perform), leading to the superordinate
goal of making ISKCON an attractive and pure society of dedicated
devotees. By emphasising these positive ways of associating with one
another, we naturally build our capacity to transform conflict and we
place our differences with one another in proper perspective.
Techniques, systems, and training are important in resolving our
conflicts, but they should be linked to the v<!-- Delete? -->ery
transformational purpose of ISKCON. Conservatives and liberals will
continue to have their differences no doubt, but I hope by employing
the above mentioned ways to address those differences that their
conflicts will strengthen ISKCON. And, like the warriors in the
<I>Mahabharata</I> who fought the enemy in the day and socialised
with them at night, ISKCON&rsquo;s conservatives and liberals will
continue to differ and then come together at night to chant Hare
Krsna, dance in <I>kirtana</I>, and feast on Krsna <I>prasadam</I><SUP><I><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote55anc" HREF="#sdendnote55sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></I></SUP>&mdash;pizza
and pakoras.</p>
