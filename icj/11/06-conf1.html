<p><strong>24 September 2004<br>
  Boston, USA<br>
  <a href="99-biodata.html#pd">Premananda Dasa</a></strong></p>
<p>Since its founding
by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) has
undergone dramatic changes. In its formative stages, ISKCON was
primarily a monastic movement comprised of Western converts who
became well-known for enthusiastic proselytising.</p>

<p>In the past twenty
years, monasticism in North American ISKCON has dwindled, and the
organisation has become congregation-based. The face of these
congregations has grown increasingly Indian. The <I>asramas </I>(monastic
quarters) have been weakened further by a dearth of Canadian
and American recruits. Temples now regularly sponsor priests from
other countries to perform basic functions.</p>

<p>Some people believe
ISKCON is maturing, finding its niche as a chaplain to the Indian
diaspora. Organisers of the first Bhakti Vedanta Mission Conference,
held in Boston on 24 September 2004, questioned the appropriateness
of this downsized role from a new perspective, making an historic
first attempt to codify a mission theology for Gaudiya
Vaisnavism.</p>

<p>The Conference drew
twenty participants&mdash;all ISKCON members&mdash;to discuss three
presentations. Governing Body Commissioner Ravindra Svarupa Dasa
began by underscoring the missiological themes of &lsquo;Markine
Bhagavata Dharma&rsquo; (&lsquo;Teaching Krsna Consciousness in
America&rsquo;), a prayer written by Srila Prabhupada upon his
arrival in the United States in 1965.</p>

<p>Ravindra Svarupa
Dasa noted that Srila Prabhupada understood that it seemed unlikely
that he&mdash;an impoverished elderly monk in poor health with no
institutional support&mdash;would be successful in single-handedly
evangelising the West.</p>

<p>Through the poem,
Ravindra Svarupa Dasa said that readers come to understand that Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s mission was to spread the glorification of Krsna
all over the world. For this mission to be successful, however, Srila
Prabhupada prayed that the Lord bless him and his audience.</p>

<p>Ravindra Svarupa
Dasa concluded that the act of Gaudiya mission is based upon the
humility, sincerity, and compassionate insight of its proponents.
These qualities will enable the presentation of the message of Krsna
in ways that are meaningful to modern audiences. The success of that
mission is based upon the blessings and authority of the Lord and the
teachers in disciplic succession.</p>

<p><B>Essential
principles of Gau</B><B>d</B><B>iya
mission</B></p>
<p>In my paper,
informed by a review of literature by Eastern Orthodox and Protestant
theologians, as well as Gaudiya
scripture and history, I articulated eight doctrinal and practical
principles of Gaudiya missiology as follows:</p>

<p><I>Doctrinal
principles</I></p>
<ul>
  <li><I>Avatara:</I> The
    Lord&rsquo;s descent as the model for mission</li>
  <li><I>Yutha:</I> The <I>sampradaya</I> as the Lord&rsquo;s service group and missional
    instrument</li>
  <li><I>Saragraha:</I> The essence according to time, place, and candidate</li>
  <li><I>Yukta-vairagya:</I> Utilising everything favourable in Krsna&rsquo;s service</li>
</ul>
<p><I>Practical
principles</I></p>
<ul>
  <li><I>Vairagya-vidya:</I>
    The foundation of mission in preaching, practice, and worship</li>
  <li><I>Adhikara:</I> Mission&rsquo;s appeal to various audiences</li>
  <li><I>Ei desa:</I> The
    native expression of worldwide mission</li>
  <li><I>Sva-cestitam:</I> The wholeness of each Vaisnava community</li>
</ul>
<p>The rise and decline
of the tradition throughout the past five centuries has rested in the
ability or inability of its leaders to contextualise these
imperatives. I expressed my opinion that ISKCON&rsquo;s current nadir
in North America is fundamentally a result of its members&rsquo; lack
of awareness of missiological principles.</p>

<p>The impetus for
mission begins in Sri Krsna&rsquo;s
compassion for all souls. The Lord descends to induce humanity to
remember Him by His teachings and pastimes. These vary according to
the era, but the purpose is the same: &lsquo;Krsna
should always be remembered and never forgotten. All rules and
prohibitions mentioned in the <I>s</I><I>astras</I>
should be the servants of these two principles.&rsquo; (<I>Padma
Purana</I>)</p>

<p>Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu deputed His followers to expand congregational chanting to
new nations and generations. I noted that Gaudiya <I>acaryas</I>
(teachers in disciplic succession) contextualised widely and deeply,
thereby making Krsna
consciousness relevant to their audiences. By necessity the mission
takes various forms to address audiences in various countries: sacred
texts are translated into local languages, natives are enfranchised
as laity and clergy, and so on. Adaptation and appropriation are
imperatives as the mission addresses new candidates and cultural
forces.</p>

<p>Much of the
discussion regarding my paper focused on who is qualified to adapt
the tradition&rsquo;s teachings and practices in the absence of Srila
Prabhupada. One participant noted that some would oppose any such
attempts, insisting that ISKCON&rsquo;s success lay in simply
imitating Srila Prabhupada.</p>

<p>One of the
conference organisers, Nimai Nitai Dasa, replied that imitating Srila
Prabhupada would demand that devotees show the same flexibility Srila
Prabhupada did in adapting and contextualising Krsna consciousness to
suit its audiences.</p>

<p>Ravindra Svarupa
Dasa proposed a conciliar model in which dedicated and sincere
devotees who feel the urgency to make Krsna consciousness available
to everyone could work together to discuss and experiment, following
the guidance of the scriptures and the <I>acaryas.</I> Participants
noted precedent in Gaudiya history for this method in establishing
unity among Gaudiya
schools and ascertaining best theological practices.</p>

<p><strong>Overcoming
nominalism and developing a new strategy for American mission</strong></p>

<p>Lacking a strong and
active commitment to contextualisation of mission principles, ISKCON
has become increasingly Hindu in appearance and tone, according to
Nimai Nitai Dasa, whose paper concluded the Conference. Rather than
representing the maturation of the Hare Krsna movement in North
America, Nimai Nitai said, &lsquo;Hindu-isation&rsquo; represents the
weakening of mission and the growing influence of nominalism.</p>

<p>He emphasised the
roles of sectarianism and phyletism in weakening ISKCON&rsquo;s
appeal to mainstream audiences. He defined sectarianism as the loss
of spiritual relevancy, defined in terms of transforming the lives of
followers.</p>

<p>According to Nimai
Nitai, a disciplic lineage (<I>sampradaya</I>) can be defined in
spiritual or secular terms. The spiritual <I>sampradaya </I>focuses
its energies on helping its members overcome worldliness. Its secular
counterpart places greater emphasis on institutional survival: &lsquo;If
it cures the living entities&mdash;if it makes the correct diagnosis
of the disease, and if it knows the way of therapy&mdash;then it is
the divine and not the secular <I>sampradaya</I>....
When the <I>sampradaya</I> does not cure the living entities, but
rather is concerned with other matters, it ceases to be divine and
becomes secular.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Phyletism is the
idealisation of religious ethnicity. In North American ISKCON, Nimai
Nitai Dasa observed, devotees adopt the language, ritualism, and
appearance of Hinduism to gain &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; in the eyes
of Indian congregations. &lsquo;They exchange a Western ethnicity for
an Indian ethnicity, without realising that both are external
designations arising from material conditioning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By implication,
Nimai Nitai indicated that ISKCON in North America has gotten
sidetracked by matters of institutional survival and has, perhaps
unconsciously, embraced ethnocentrism as a means to that end.</p>
<p>He prescribed
maximalism&mdash;the endeavour to embrace higher spiritual
standards&mdash;as the antidote for nominalism. &lsquo;We must
organically transform ISKCON in North America into a missional
community that fulfils the theological, liturgical, and pastoral
needs of devotees, and serves as a beacon for integration of
Westerners into <I>bhagavat-dharma</I>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He said the first
step toward this goal is to educate and train <I>asrama</I> members
in monastic vocations steeped in spiritual practice. &lsquo;The heart
of the <I>sampradaya</I> has always been its renunciates.... Our
society needs dedicated and educated <I>vairagis </I>[renunciates];
not a professional clergy, as in contemporary Western religious
institutions, but a committed, inspired, and inspiring core (heart).&rsquo;</p>

<p>Inspiring faith
among congregational members and the general populace is a crucial
element of mission. Nimai Nitai noted that elements for successful
outreach are already in place. He proposed a strategy to encourage
seekers to become devotees through gradual and specific
commitments&mdash;an expansion of the <I>asraya-krama</I> process
adopted by the GBC in 1993. &lsquo;ISKCON has
different constituencies, with different levels of commitment to the
<I>sankirtana </I>movement of Mahaprabhu.... Our approach for
addressing these diverse levels must be to invite devotees to go a
step further&mdash;that is, the Society must facilitate their
progress to the next higher level of commitment.&rsquo;</p>


<p>Organisers expect to publish the full
proceedings of the session in early 2005 and hold another conference
this autumn. An obvious challenge will be raising awareness of the
importance of missional principles among ISKCON leaders and members
in North America. The Conference organisers noted that a
mission-based approach would provide valuable insights to ISKCON
reform efforts&mdash;such as the North American GBC-sponsored
Spiritual Strategic Planning initiative.</p>
