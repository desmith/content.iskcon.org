<p>I was happy to read
Sesa&rsquo;s article in ICJ (Vol. 10), specifically for its potential
to initiate constructive debate on a topic that has received scant
attention within ISKCON. In discussing the subject of values and
virtues, Sesa
moves through a broad range of issues. Drawing from his own
experience in the US army, he usefully alludes to the dangers of
elitism, particularly within an institution that is insulated from
mainstream society. Reflecting on the aftermath of 9/11, he
intuitively rejects any sense of loyalty, and sentiments such as
unity, purpose, and certainty, that are grounded in enmity; an enemy
who resides &lsquo;out there&rsquo;, who is forever the outsider, one
of &lsquo;them&rsquo; rather than one of &lsquo;us&rsquo;. His
comments reminded me of the attitudes reflected in many contemporary
religions (or, more accurately, individuals and factions within
them). He identifies his disquiet as being underpinned by his own
conviction that a genuine religious or spiritual path is
introspective, addressing, &lsquo;the need to become a better
person&rsquo;. Subsequently he explores some of the virtues
recommended in texts such as <I>Bhagavad-gita</I>.
However, his main theme targets the tensions between material and
spiritual duties. Exploring the story of the <I>brahmana</I> called
Kausika, he specifically identifies within ISKCON a tendency towards
its own brand of elitism, dubbed &lsquo;premature transcendence
syndrome&rsquo;, which may have led members into believing that the
process of self-realisation exempted them from acting morally or from
focusing on character formation. He proposes that ISKCON now makes it
a priority to endorse and strengthen its family values, suggesting
that these, for most of us, are not at odds with the path of
spiritual life, but essential to it. He concludes that the practice
of virtue is essential in developing not just theoretical knowledge
(<I>jnana</I>) but wisdom (<I>vijnana</I>). 
</p>
<p>The issues raised by
Sesa&rsquo;s essay are diverse. In trying to identify a common theme,
I recall a colleague&rsquo;s observation: &lsquo;We should no longer
try to squeeze the world into ISKCON, but ensure that ISKCON
appropriately enters the world&rsquo;. Sesa&rsquo;s emphasis on the
<I>grhastha</I> <I>asrama </I>(household life) alludes to that
process whereby an individual, having imbibed spiritual
responsibility, leaves the protective confines of the guru&rsquo;s
hermitage to adopt broader social duties. This subject is relevant to
some social phenomena within ISKCON: the lack of systematic education
within the <I>brahmacari</I> (celibate student) <I>asrama</I>; the
questionable attitudes developed therein, such as the misconception
that <I>brahmacarya </I>is more elevated than <I>grhastha</I> life;
and the inordinate esteem given to external renunciation at the
expense of personal integrity. Hence the dialectic between worldly
and spiritual duties, as Sesa
explores, is often paralleled by tensions between renunciates<I> </I>and
householders. Evidence is found in <I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</I> of
how Caitanya showed deep affection for both <I>sannyasis</I> and
<I>grhasthas</I>. His discrimination was different. As illustrated in
the story of Chota Haridasa (<I>Antya-lila</I>, Chapter 2), he was
ruthless in condemning hypocrisy, the antithesis of integrity. 
</p>
<p>Sesa
builds on his theme by explaining how personal integrity is enshrined
within the practice of <I>dharma</I>,<I> </I>religiously ordained
duties. He usefully disabuses the widespread notion that the Vedic
(Hindu) concept of <I>dharma</I> is blind and non-reflective. He
points to scriptural evidence supporting the need for careful
consideration of consequences, implying that the Vedic tradition
interweaves strong elements of utilitarianism within a deontological
approach. The reflective and anecdotal nature of his essay models the
need for ISKCON members to develop the skills of relating
life-experiences to <I>sastra</I>, of establishing a reflexive
dialogue between personal perceptions and scriptural views; and,
indeed, of evaluating one&rsquo;s own conduct against expected
values. This dialogical approach may well be part of the process of
developing what Sesa calls <I>vijnana</I> (wisdom, or realised
knowledge). He also implies that personal authority (and the system
of <I>varnasrama</I>) should be based on actual qualities rather than
position or birthright, thus contesting the misplaced idea (within
much academia) that <I>varnasrama</I> and current caste practice are
synonymous. ISKCON follows in the footsteps of Caitanya, who
unequivocally opposed the (hereditary) caste-system. Significantly,
his rejection is based on a theology of transcendence. In the light
of Sesa&rsquo;s analysis, it might be rewarding to examine whether
ISKCON has developed its own forms of caste-ism, by which status and
authority are inordinately determined by gender, <I>asrama</I>, or
spiritual &lsquo;parentage&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>It is only too easy,
however, to discuss ISKCON in a mood of negative criticism. Sesa
admirably avoids this, as his endorsement of personal integrity
demands. In any spiritual tradition, it is natural that there is
difference between the ideal and the real; this itself does not
constitute hypocrisy. Rather, the real question is whether members,
individually and socially, are striving to reduce any such
disparities. Sesa&rsquo;s
article thus encourages the ISKCON leadership (using the term
broadly) to ask pertinent questions, such as, &lsquo;What values have
we factually encouraged in our members? Are they congruent with our
teachings? What are the social and educational processes by which
values are developed?&rsquo; Furthermore, we might ask, &lsquo;In any
society, who is responsible for the predominant values and
organisational culture?&rsquo; Although Sesa
implies that we ourselves become agents of change, he does not
sufficiently explore the roles of &lsquo;key players&rsquo;, such as
teachers, parents, and administrative leaders. 
</p>
<p>Sesa&rsquo;s
study thus raises more questions than it answers. That, I suspect,
was his intention. However, there are some questions that remain
conspicuously unanswered. Sesa
rightly proposes that values and virtues can be found in all
societies. However, we might legitimately ask, &lsquo;Do common
values exist?&rsquo; For example, there are tensions between
traditional, faith-based virtues and more popular values (one reason,
not necessarily valid, why a spiritual society may resist contact
with &lsquo;the outside world&rsquo;). Chastity, though important to
Sesa,
is not popular these days.</p>
<p>Another passage from
Sesa&rsquo;s
article that requires further exploration is the butcher&rsquo;s
statement: &lsquo;One whose heart is naturally inclined towards
truthfulness, charity, and non-violence, is actually a virtuous
person&rsquo;. This idea that we can be virtuous in attitude despite
our behaviour could easily be misconstrued. Thus, the causal
inter-relationship between values and conduct requires further
elaboration. Although, on one hand, Sesa
explores &lsquo;premature transcendence&rsquo;, he neglects (perhaps
through lack of space) to explore the opposite pole: spiritual
complacency standing on the moral high ground of worldly duties.</p>
<p>What Sesa&rsquo;s
article admirably highlights is that these issues, tensions, and
(apparent) ambiguities are not easy to resolve; certainly not through
dichotomous thinking. Sesa
refers to &lsquo;the divisive us and them mentality&rsquo;.
Ironically, such sectarianism might be a feature not only of
over-identification with the body, family, country, etc., but also of
aversion to interacting with the mundane, often in the name of
transcendence. 
</p>
<p>In dealing with
these dialectics, Sesa
implicitly refers to another subject pertinent to ISKCON&rsquo;s
future: the whole issue of continuity and change. What ensures the
authentic perpetuation of any tradition? What can we legitimately
change? What must be preserved at all costs? Sesa
suggests the centrality of core values as expressed through
narrative. Of his chosen story, he writes: &lsquo;Although set in
ancient times [it is] adaptable to the modern world&rsquo;. Whether
emphasis on values and virtues alone can ensure effective continuity
requires further dialogue.</p>
<p>Sesa&rsquo;s
article thus prompts a further query: &lsquo;What are the qualities
and virtues required of those engaged in such debate?&rsquo; A
certain intellectual integrity&mdash;and personal integrity&mdash;is
certainly required. Unfortunately the level of much debate within
ISKCON, particularly by e-mail, appears to reflect a culture of
dichotomous thinking, of polemic and blame. I personally welcome
forums such as that offered by the ICJ, and hope that Sesa&rsquo;s
study serves as an impetus for further contributions&mdash;articles
that are not only academic but share insights born of a reflective
and reflexive commitment, and which help ISKCON constructively
address the issues of values, virtues, and morality. Furthermore, I
do feel that the &lsquo;Vedic&rsquo; model has much to contribute to
the wider discussions on values; for example, the notion that
different sections of society may have&mdash;should have&mdash;somewhat
different values. If ISKCON embraces such debate, within and without,
it can be benefited and can also contribute to the wider good. Sesa&rsquo;s
article is therefore to be applauded and certainly deserves a more
thorough response than this brief review.</p>
