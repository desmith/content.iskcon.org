            <p><strong>12&ndash;14 November 2004<br>
            Rome, Italy<br>
            <a href="99-biodata.html#je">Jonathan Edelmann</a></strong></p>
            <p>The Bhaktivedanta Institute held the
Second International Congress on &lsquo;Life and Its Origin&rsquo; on
12&ndash;14 November. The Congress was held in the Protomoteca Hall,
on Rome&rsquo;s beautiful Capitol Hill. The aim was to bring together
representatives of the world&rsquo;s religions and the natural
sciences to discuss perspectives on the origin of life,
consciousness, the soul, life after death, the purpose and meaning of
science and religion, and God. All of these topics were couched in
various theological perspectives, as well as scientific theories such
as Big Bang, neo-Darwinism, Quantum Mechanics, and Relativity Theory.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, most science and
religion dialogues tend to focus on Christianity and modern science;
Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists engage with science to a lesser extent,
and Hindus even less than that. This conference, however, attempted
to represent most of the world&rsquo;s religions, as well as many of
the sciences. There was something else unique here. The very notion
of dialogue suggests equality, and this was explicit. It was assumed
that science is not the final arbiter of truth, rather that the
sciences and the religions have their own wealth of insight on this
most elusive of all topics&mdash;life itself. Instead of a
competition between the religions, or between religions and science,
the traditions were employed as culturally specific, yet not
culturally constrained, avenues to truth. Each tradition was
respected as coming from a particular cultural, linguistic, and
textual context, but it was not assumed that truths and insights
beyond those traditions were precluded.</p>

<p>The conference started with invocations
and blessings from religious leaders: a Jesuit priest, a Buddhist
rimpoche, a Hindu swami, a Jewish rabbi, an Islamic imam, and a Sikh
all expressed their sense of the importance of such discussion
between the religions and sciences.</p>

<p>Some memorable moments from the
sessions: In Session One, Professor Arij Roest Crollius SJ of the
Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome spoke about beauty. That
which is closer to God is more beautiful, hence this is a way of
judging object, ideas, and events. Most notably, he concluded his
talk by chanting a <I>Bhagavad-gita</I> verse in the traditional
Gregorian metre&mdash;and <I>that</I> was very beautiful. In Session
Two there was a lively Q&amp;A about the nature of consciousness in
the <I>Bhagavata-Purana</I>, a Vaisnava-Hindu text, and the problems
of holding a non-physical view of consciousness in light of modern
biology. In Session Three, Professor Robert Mann, the Chair of the
Physics Department at the University of Waterloo, attempted to show
that neo-Darwinian evolution is a challenge to any religious
tradition that believes there is teleology in the world, and Dr Anita
Goel, from the department of Health, Sciences and Technology at
Harvard University, attempted to show how &lsquo;intelligent design&rsquo;
could be inserted in nature. In Session Five, Professor Gianfranco
Basti, a Catholic Priest from the respected Lateran University in
Rome, gave a lucid exposition of the mind-body problem, and a
persuasive defence of Thomistic views of the soul in light of
contemporary computational theory and computer science.</p>

<p>Session Four saw a unique turn of
events: Professor Lothar Schafer, a well known physical chemist and
science-religion writer, argued that matter, as seen in quantum
physics, is conscious, and thus the natural/supernatural or
physical/metaphysical distinction is blurred by twentieth-century
physics. Also in Session Four, Mann showed how neo-Darwinism has
become the lens through which fundamental academic fields of research
such as psychology and religion are viewed. This shows another
challenge to religions.</p>

<p>In Session Eight, the accomplished
Professor of Physics V. V. Raman, the 2004 Metanexus Senior Research
Fellow, spoke about the importance of uniting science and religion,
with special reference to Hinduism. In Session Ten, Dr Marco Gozzi
made a very important and insightful comment: &lsquo;We need a
glossary or set of common words and concepts by which we can
establish a dialogue between science and religion.&rsquo; Perhaps the
greatest problem in science-religion discussion&mdash;as Gozzi
rightly points out&mdash;is that of translating terms and concepts
from one tradition to another. If I could make one criticism of the
conference, it is that words like &lsquo;science&rsquo;, &lsquo;religion&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;spirituality&rsquo; were employed without critical rigour,
as if they meant the same thing at different points in history, for
different religions, and even for various people within the same
religion.</p>

<p>Finally, Session Eleven was a
conversation led by Anita Goel into the question of how science can
help religion, and how religion can help science. This is the crux of
the issue: it was nice to have scientists and theologians of various
religions talking about the importance of unifying themselves, but
what does that really mean? I found many of the definitions of
&lsquo;science&rsquo; and &lsquo;religion&rsquo; glib. We can&rsquo;t
assume we know what these words mean to each other, or that their
meanings are the same across history and in different
scientific/religious traditions. Moreover, more work could and should
be done on the heart of the issue: what does it really mean to have a
synthesis, and how is this going to practically affect the academic
disciplines?</p>

<p>Dr T. D. Singh, the organiser of this
conference and head of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, concluded with a
vote of thanks to all involved, especially the staff and the cooks
(who prepared wonderful vegetarian Italian cuisine). He also
delivered a very inspirational lecture stressing the importance of
peace between academic disciplines and the world&rsquo;s religions,
as well as the need for open-mindedness. I believe it is conferences
like these that can help further the discussion between the sciences
and religions, and the Bhaktivedanta Institute deserves praise for
taking such an active role.</p>
