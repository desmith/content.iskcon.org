                  <p class=Purport><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>History 

                    cannot be written without data, and the evidence for what 

                    happened in the past does not collect itself automatically. 

                    The first task in studying the history of ISKCON is therefore 

                    the slow and time-consuming job of assembling as much evidence 

                    as possible about ISK­CON's growth from 1965 to the present. 

                    This is a very complex matter, because ISKCON did not grow 

                    slowly from its early beginning in New York City; instead, 

                    it exploded across the country and around the world with such 

                    speed that those involved had little time to reflect on what 

                    was happening and even less time to keep careful records of 

                    what they were doing. The record is more complete where Prabhupada 

                    was directly involved, but outside the spot­light of attention 

                    on him there was only sporadic documentation of what was being 

                    done, by whom and to what effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                  <p class=purppara><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The 

                    data problem was made more difficult, of course, by ISKCON's 

                    multinational growth. The earlier disciples were English speaking 

                    and mostly American, but the 'Hare Krishna' movement soon 

                    spread beyond North America and into new language areas. Within 

                    a few years there were temples and centres not only in the 

                    US, Canada, England and Australia but also in continental 

                    Europe, Central and South America, Africa and the Far East 

                    - not to mention India, which soon became a major focus of 

                    Prabhupada's activity. One can get a general picture of what 

                    was happening between 1965 and 1977 by reading Prabhupada's 

                    biography and the diaries of disciples who were with him for 

                    various periods during this dozen years of rapid expansion. 

                    There is no overall history of ISKCON's institutional de­velop­ment 

                    even during Prabhupada's lifetime, however, and even less 

                    reporting of ISKCON's history after 1977 except for narrowly 

                    focused studies of national or local branches - and many of 

                    these are by outsiders, not ISKCON members. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                  <p class=purppara><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Given 

                    this situation, there is an urgent need to collect as much 

                    information as possible on the past three decades of ISKCON's 

                    existence. ISKCON is not the first Asian religion to find 

                    a following in the West, but it is the first to gain such 

                    a widespread following without losing its Indian identity. 

                    As a result, it has been able to maintain continuity for Hindus 

                    in the West while also serving the needs of Western disciples. 

                    This is one of the great stories in world religious history, 

                    and it should be told with full attention to the details of 

                    how it happened. How did Prabhupada preserve the culture of 

                    Bengal Vaisnavism in a western context? What innovations were 

                    made to ensure that this culture would continue? What institutions 

                    provided support for this process of cultural transfer and 

                    how did they work over time? What variations have developed 

                    within ISKCON in response to different cultural settings? 

                    How did ISKCON become involved in serving the religious needs 

                    of immigrant Hindus, and with what effect on both ISKCON and 

                    the immigrant community?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                  <p class=purppara><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Evidence 

                    to help answer these and other historical questions exists 

                    in many ISKCON records scattered throughout the world and 

                    in the memories of many ISKCON disciples who were involved 

                    in the relevant decisions and programmes. To date, however, 

                    there has been no serious effort to assemble this evidence 

                    and no place where it could be gathered together and studied. 

                    The Oxford Centre for Vaisnava and Hindu Studies has recently 

                    begun the process of collecting archival material on ISKCON's 

                    history from various sources. For the first time, there is 

                    now a place where all of ISKCON's records can be maintained 

                    as a resource for historians and other scholars. There is 

                    also for the first time a commitment to include in this resource 

                    bank information on the Hindu Diaspora as a whole, both to 

                    place ISKCON in its historical context and to provide a service 

                    to the larger Hindu community. <o:p></o:p></span><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
