              Goswami (H.J. Resnick) explains where the term 'Hindu' originates 
              from. He asks for whom does the term 'Hindu' speak and who can speak 
              for the 'Hindus'. To which of the multitude of widely differing 
              worldviews does this term apply? What are the implications of accepting 
              'Hindu' as a designation? Hrdayananda Dasa Goswami also looks at 
              the history of the word and discovers how and where it came into 
              common use by scholars and by the 'Hindus' themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></i><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <h5 class=Subhead2><span lang=EN-US><b>Introduction</b></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></h5>
            <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>In his remarkable work, <i>India 
              and Europe,</i> Wilhelm Halbfass notes that, ' ... the critical, 
              historical and often reductive work of Western Indologists has met 
              with passionate rejection by conservative Hinduism and been seen 
              as part of a strategy of Western domination and suppression.' (p. 
              259)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>One consequence of the rising political, 
              intellectual and religious self-confidence and self-assertion of 
              contemporary India, especially its Hindu majority, is the Indian 
              attempt to reclaim from the Western academy the right to 'objectively' 
              and 'authoritatively', if not 'scientifically', explain itself and 
              its history to the world. There is frequent tension between those 
              who would defend with a learned voice Hinduism's traditional, scripture-based 
              self-history, and those who seek to explain India by the standards 
              of Western humanistic scholarship, under the various rubrics of 
              Indology, South Asian Languages/Literatures/Civilisation, Anthropology, 
              Hindu Studies, History of India, etc.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
              </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>From this dialectic tension arose 
              the challenging and much debated question: 'Who speaks for Hinduism?' 
              In English, 'to speak <i>for</i>' often means to speak 'on behalf 
              of; as the agent of; on the part of.' In this sense, we may easily 
              concede that Hindus, like members of any community, have a right 
              to designate and authorise those who may speak 'on behalf of,' or 
              'as the agent of', their group.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, 'Who may speak 
              <i>about</i> Hinduism?' is a more complex question. In a legal context, 
              within a free society, anyone may, as long as they do not commit 
              slander, libel etc. However, the relevant question, in spirit, would 
              seem to be, 'Who can speak objectively, authoritatively, meaningfully 
              <i>about</i> Hinduism?' Clearly, some scholars believe that one 
              who speaks objectively <i>about</i> anything, truly speaks <i>for</i> 
              that thing, since such fair, accurate speech best <i>represents</i> 
              the truth of what a thing is. In the 'hard sciences' rocks, rivers, 
              and even reptiles hardly speak <i>for</i> themselves in the sense 
              of learned discourse. Hence the scientist speaks <i>for</i> them. 
              To the extent that scholars in the humanities have sought to ape 
              the 'hard sciences' (and the extent is not meagre), there has been 
              a palpable tendency to speak <i>for</i> what are perceived as 'pre-scientific' 
              communities, even as one speaks <i>about </i>them. Of course, we 
              are all aware that such a philosophically naive position has undergone 
              much stimulating criticism in recent decades. So without dredging 
              up the murky aspects of the Orientalist legacy, suffice it to say 
              that many, though certainly not all, Western scholars have believed 
              and asserted their ability to speak more objectively, and thus more 
              authoritatively, <i>about</i> Hinduism, than those recognised within 
              the Hindu community as reliable spokespersons, and this has created 
              quite a ruckus among Hindus both in India and abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>My point here is not simply that 
              Western academic types are the bogey-persons of Indian studies. 
              Indeed, much Western scholarship about India, both now and in the 
              past, has been excellent and invaluable. Rather, I wish to argue 
              that many claiming to represent and speak <i>for</i> Hinduism, from 
              <i>within</i> Hinduism, have themselves appropriated the voice of 
              groups within the Hindu complex in a way that is analogous to the 
              Orientalist appropriation of the Hindu voice. Thus in response to 
              the question, 'Who speaks for Hinduism?' I raise the question, 'For 
              <i>whom</i> does Hinduism speak?' I do so not only as a scholar 
              of Vaisnavism, but also as one who has lived as a Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              for about thirty years. (<a href="#1d">1</a>)</span><sup><span

lang=EN-US style='font-size:5.5pt'><a name="1"></a>&nbsp;</span></sup><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>I will argue below that in early 
              Vaisnava, and indeed Vedic, religious discourse and polemics, the 
              term and concept 'Hindu' is unknown. Later, in contact with the 
              Muslim rulers of India, Vaisnavas become 'Hindu' for the outsider, 
              the foreigner, but not for themselves, nor among themselves. Finally, 
              in the last few centuries, the 'modern' period of contact with the 
              West, the term 'Hindu' emerged as an all-embracing <i>internal </i>term 
              that, for the first time, sought to define and contain followers 
              of the <i>Vedas,</i> <i>for</i> and <i>among</i> themselves. I shall 
              make the further claim that the attempt of spokespersons of a modern, 
              generic <i>Hinduism</i> to speak for the Vaisnava tradition distorts 
              that tradition and brings in its wake other kinds of harm to the 
              ancient spiritual wisdom of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Although there are many ways in 
              which one might classify the development of the term 'Hindu' in 
              South Asia, I will sketch that process in three historical stages, 
              as mentioned above. First, though, it is necessary to reveal a few 
              essential facts about the word <i>hindu</i>.</span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <h5 class=Subhead2><span lang=EN-US><b>'Hindu' is not found in the 
              Hindu scriptures, the <i>Vedas</i>, which are written in Sanskrit<o:p></o:p></b><o:p></o:p></span></h5>
            <p class=halfline><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US>Why 
              is this important? Although the task of defining Hinduism has proved 
              elusive, historically the acceptance of the Sanskrit <i>Vedas</i> 
              as sacred scripture has served as a bedrock standard for a true 
              Hindu. Buddhism and Jainism, though born on Indian soil, are not 
              included within the endless variety of Hindu doctrines and practices, 
              chiefly because both these traditions rejected the supreme authority 
              of the <i>Vedas</i>. Indeed, in the legal definition of Hinduism, 
              given by the Indian Supreme Court in 1966, the first criterion is 
              'Acceptance of the <i>Vedas</i> with reverence as the highest authority 
              in religious and philosophic matters.' We thus have an unusual situation 
              in which one becomes a Hindu by accepting the authority of scriptures 
              that do not recognise the word 'Hindu'.</span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <h5 class=Purport><span lang=EN-US><b>'Hindu' is not a Sanskrit word<o:p></o:p></b><o:p></o:p></span></h5>
            <p class=halfline><span lang=EN-US>It is of further significance that 
              <i>hindu</i> is not a Sanskrit word. Early Vedic literature often 
              uses the term <i>Arya</i> to designate the true and noble followers 
              of Vedic culture. And as Halbfass points out: <o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>' ... language is a central 
              criterion for the definition of the Aryan. It is essential for preserving 
              his ritual power and identity against the <i>mlecchas</i> [foreigners, 
              barbarians]. The continuity of the tradition, the identity and stability 
              of the Aryan <i>dharma,</i> depends on its linguistic vehicle, the 
              Sanskrit language... .<span

            <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>Yet so totally absent is the word 
              <i>hindu</i> from traditional Sanskrit literature, that in his well-known 
              work, <i>A History of Sanskrit Literature,</i> the great Oxford 
              Sanskritist A.A. Macdonell mentioned the word <i>hindu</i> only 
              once <i>-</i> and that was in order to give the standard, geographic 
              explanation of the term's origin:<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>'The Sindhu (now Sindh), which 
              in Sanskrit simply means the 'river', as the western boundary of 
              the Aryan settlements, suggested to the nations of antiquity which 
              first came into contact with them in that quarter, a name for the 
              whole peninsula. Adopted in the form of <i>Indos</i>, the word gave 
              rise to the Greek appellation <i>India</i> as the country of the 
              Indus. It was borrowed by the ancient Persians as <i>hindu,</i> 
              which is used in the <i>Avesta</i> as a name of the country itself. 
              More accurate is the modern Persian designation <i>Hindustan</i>, 
              'Land of the Indus', a name properly applying only to that part 
              of the peninsula which lies between the Himalaya and the Vindhya 
              range [roughly North to Central India]' (Munshirama, 1972, p. 142).<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class=Subhead2><span lang=EN-US>The earliest canonical expressions

              The foundational scripture for devotion to the Lord as King Rama

              Sanskrit.</span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Even as late as the tenth and eleventh 
              centuries of the common era, we find this term entirely absent in 
              essential Vaisnava devotional, philosophical and apologetic writings. 
              We shall illustrate this by briefly considering the works of two 
              great <i>acaryas</i> (spiritual leaders/teachers) of the Sri Vaisnava 
              tradition of Southeast India, surely one of the most historically 
              important Vaisnava 'denominations'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Yamunacarya, born around 916 <span

style='text-transform:uppercase'>ce</span>, 'is the first Vaisnava <i>acarya</i> 
              whose works are extant' (Narayanan 59). This important figure wrote 
              a philosophical treatise called <i>Agama-pramanyam</i>, 'a fierce 
              defense of the agamic literature' (ibid. 60). Concerning the hard-fought 
              debate of that time between the Tamil Vaisnavas and the Smarta-brahmanas, 
              'Yamuna, our source', says the late Professor van Buitenen, referring 
              to the <i>Agama-pramanyam,</i> 'is an unimpeachable authority. Here 
              we have not a sectarian text speaking in pious and traditional platitudes 
              about wicked adversaries, but a Bhagavata with a fine mind who seeks 
              to enumerate, and subsequently to invalidate, very precisely the 
              traditional arguments of the Smartas against the less-than-respectable 
              Bhagavatas.' (van Buitenen, pp. 26-27).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>In this debate, neither the protagonist 
              nor his theological adversary ever use the term 'Hindu' or 'Hinduism'. 
              What is perhaps more remarkable is that in Dr Narayanan's authoritative 
              history of the Sri Vaisnava tradition, the word 'Hindu' or 'Hinduism' 
              does not even appear in her index. In other words, it is possible 
              for a distinguished scholar to write the history of an important 
              'Hindu' denomination without using the word 'Hindu' in her book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>In his own theological and philosophical 
              struggles with the Buddhists, Sankara seeks, along with the Mimamsakas, 
              to demonstrate the authority of the <i>Vedas</i>. And in his debates 
              with the Mimamsakas, the rhetorical goal is to demonstrate that 
              one's own community is <i>vaidika,</i> Vedic, and has best understood 
              the message of the <i>Vedas.</i> Later, the illustrious Ramanuja 
              made powerful arguments against the teachings of Sankara in favour 
              of a personal God. Again, the discourse aims to prove that one group 
              is truly <i>vaidika,</i> and that the members of one's soteriological 
              group will actually achieve the highest <i>moksa,</i> liberation. 
              In all of these historically seminal, intellectually sophisticated 
              and religiously crucial debates, we do not find the term <i>hindu</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

              and usually by, the <i>yavana-mleccha</i>, i.e. the Muslim, who 
              is outside the sacred culture of the <i>Vedas</i>. Joseph O'Connell 
              introduces his article, <i>The word 'Hindu' in Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              texts</i>, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                <p><span lang=EN-US>A survey of three Sanskrit and ten Bengali 
                  hagiographic texts from early sixteenth to late eighteenth centuries 
                  discloses nearly fifty passages (all in the Bengali texts) in 
                  which the word 'Hindu' appears. Most occurrences are in episodes 
                  of strained relationships between Hindus and <i>yavanas </i>or 
                  <i>mlecchas,</i> as the Muslims are called. The strains are 
                  usually resolved satisfactorily<i>. The word 'Hindu' never appears 
                  in a purely intra-communal Hindu context and has no significance

                  of bhakti. </i>(emphasis mine) ... there is to be found no explicit

                it is interesting to note how often it is in the mouth of a non-Hindu 
                that the word 'Hindu' is placed by the writers' (ibid. p. 341).<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>O'Connell further observes: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US>'It 
                was over against a group of people or type of people considered 
                both foreign and barbarous (and often violent, as expressions 
                like <i>kala-jabana,</i> "Death-Yavana", indicate) that the self-awareness 
                of the Vaisnavas as Hindus was fashioned' (p. 342).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US>About 
                this same period and phenomenon, Halbfass writes, 'In this climate 
                of 'sectarian' strife and search for identity (i.e. the Gaudiya 
                Vaisnava and Vallabhiya 'proselytising'), the word 'Hindu', which 
                so far had been used by foreigners, specifically Muslims, was 
                first employed by the Hindus themselves' (p. 192).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Thus whereas in the early period, 
                'Hindu' is not a factor either within internal Vaisnava discourse, 
                nor in discourse with the 'other', we find that in the middle 
                period, and specifically in tight contact with the governing Muslims, 
                the Gaudiya Vaisnavas, and presumably other groups as well, employ 
                the Muslim term 'Hindu' self-referentially, but only in dialogue 
                with or about the ruling, and dangerous, Muslims. <o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>

              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>'The period around 1800, which 
                saw the full establishment of European power and presence in India, 
                also saw the beginnings of modern Indology, i.e. the scientific 
                exploration and objectification of India's past. The combination 
                of these two events, which is more than a temporal coincidence, 
                had a fundamental impact upon Indian attitudes towards themselves 
                and the "other".' (Halbfass, p. 172)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>One of the most striking and 
                transparent changes in the 'modern' period since around 1800, 
                is the new use of 'Hindu' as an internal self-identification. 
                Enthusiasm for this development was never unanimous. 'The Arya 
                Samaj tried to replace the word "Hindu" with the ancient term 
                Arya.' R.N. Suryanarayana calls 'Hindu' a 'detestable term ... 
                of which we should be ashamed' (Halbfass, p. 515, fn. 97).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>As one might expect, others went 
                to the opposite extreme: 'Some modern Indian nationalists, most 
                notably M.S. Golwalkar and V.D. Savarkar, have argued vehemently 
                that the world 'Hindu' was <i>not at all</i> adopted from the 
                Muslims and was <i>not</i> originally used by non-Hindus. Instead 
                they claim that it is a genuinely Indian term, reflecting 'the 
                unity, the sublimity, and the specialty' of the Indian people.' 
                (Halbfass, p. 193)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>P. Hacker has analysed modern 
                Hinduism in terms of the overlapping categories of 'neo-Hinduism' 
                and 'surviving traditional Hinduism.' Halbfass, who uses these 
                categories, does so with a caveat: 'Hacker's two categories are 
                not mutually exclusive and not always clearly distinguishable. 
                ... it is also possible "that one and the same person combines 
                elements of both ways of thinking."'(Halbfass, p. 220)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>For our purpose here, I shall 
                focus on a few of the most distinguished spokespersons of both 
                neo-Hinduism and surviving traditional Hinduism, and show how 
                in each case their idiosyncratic notions of a monolithic Hinduism 
                create significant religious problems for the Vaisnava community, 
                which is, after all, supposed to be a majority component of Hinduism. 
                This will lead directly to consideration of my question, 'For 
                whom does Hinduism speak?' and more specifically to the question, 
                'Can Hinduism speak for Vaisnavas?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>P. Hacker calls Vivekananda 'the 
                most influential shaper and propagandist of the neo-Hindu spirit' 
                (Halbfass 228). Halbfass sees him as 'one of the leading figures 
                of modern Hindu thought and self-awareness and an exemplary exponent 
                of Hindu self-representation vis-a-vis the West.' It was mentioned 
                earlier that the great Vaisnava theologians, Ramanuja and Madhva, 
                in their Vedanta commentaries, fought against the monistic, <i>advaita</i>, 
                interpretation of Sankara. But in the modern period, in the name 
                of a generic 'Hinduism', Vivekananda took up the banner of the 
                <i>advaita-vedanta</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>'The sense of identity ... which 
                [Vivekananda] tries to awaken in his fellow Indians ... means, 
                above all, the heritage of Advaita Vedanta, the tradition of Sankara. 
                Ethics, self-confidence, and brotherly love find their true and 
                binding foundation in Advaitic non-dualism' (Halbfass, p. 234).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Or, in Vivekananda's own words,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                and realising the ideal of the Advaita, that ideal of the oneness 
                of all. ... to preach the Advaita aspect of the Vedanta is necessary 
                to rouse up the hearts of men, to show them the glory of their 
                souls. It is therefore, that I preach this Advaita ... ' (From 
                Vivekananda's four lectures in London, titled 'Practical Vedanta', 
                III, 190f., quoted by Halbfass, p. 234)<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>Halbfass adds in his footnote 
                75 to this quote: 'Vivekananda often encouraged his listeners 
                to see themselves "as God."' Those familiar with Vaisnava thought 
                will instantly understand that the claim to be God is as serious 
                an offense to many Vaisnavas as it would be to many in the Abrahamic 
                traditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>But Vivekananda is not the only 
                neo-Hindu superstar to promote <i>advaita-vedanta</i> as <i>the</i> 
                doctrine of Hinduism. Let us next consider the eminent Sarvepalli 
                Radhakrishnan, Oxford scholar and former President of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>According to P. Hacker, Sarvepalli 
                Radhakrishnan 'seems to be the most typical ... neo-Hindu thinker.'</span><span lang=EN-US>(<a href="#2d">2</a>)<a name="2"></a> 
                Halbfass adds, ' ... it is evident that Radhakrishnan has been 
                a most successful spokesman of neo-Hinduism in the West, and that 
                he has produced some of the most memorable and persuasive formulations 
                of neo-Vedantic thought.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>And what is Radhakrishnan's vision 
                of applied 'Hindu philosophy'?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>'Radhakrishnan's very first articles 
                ... already articulate two fundamental themes of his neo-Hindu 
                apologetics: the importance of philosophy for the identity and 
                self-affirmation of modern India, and the significance and potential 
                application of Advaita Vedanta in the area of ethics and social 
                practice.' (<a href="#3d">3</a>)<a name="3"></a> </span><sup><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

5.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></sup><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Thus for a Vaisnava, to jump 
                on the neo-Hindu bandwagon often means in practice to directly 
                or indirectly be associated with, if not endorse, a sectarian 
                theological position totally antithetical to Vaisnavism, i.e. 
                the monistic doctrine of the absolute oneness of the soul with 
                an impersonal God. The greatest Vaisnava <i>acaryas,</i> Ramanuja, 
                Madhva, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, etc. dedicated significant portions 
                of their lives to to opposing this view. It is thus deeply troubling 
                to Vaisnavas that unity among 'Hindus' is often sought under the 
                monistic banner, while simultaneously minimising or denying the 
                great theological divide which for centuries has separated those 
                seeking to love, and those seeking to become, the Absolute Truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Having looked at two neo-Hindu 
                thinkers, let us glance at some of the prominent 'surviving, traditional' 
                Hindus. Halbfass calls Vasudeva Sastrin Abhyankara one 'of the 
                grea<s></s>test traditional pandits' in the modern age, a learned 
                man who used 'the standards of the <i>Dharmasastra</i>', the sacred

              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>The problems for Vaisnavas with 
                these two versions of 'traditional' Hinduism are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Several great Vaisnava <i>acaryas 
                </i>have historically fought for the right of any person to achieve 
                salvation, and to acquire the status of a spiritual teacher, simply 
                on the basis of <i>bhakti</i>, or devotion to God.(<a href="#6d">6</a>)</span><sup><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:5.5pt'><a name="6"></a>&nbsp;</span></sup><span

              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>In his article on the <i>Bhagavata 
                Purana</i>, perhaps the single most important scripture of the 
                Vaisnavas, Thomas Hopkins points out that one of the main points 
                in 'the religion of the <i>Bhagavata </i>[is] the absence of the 
                qualifications based on birth and status that restricted participation 
                in orthodox ceremonies.' (Hopkins, pp. 11-12)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Hopkins goes on to say, <o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>'The <i>Bhagavata</i> ... 
                also repeatedly stresses the independence of <i>bhakti</i> from 
                all alternative means of salvation. Criticism of orthodoxy does 
                not stop at the theological level. ... Here the primary objective 
                is to refute the idea that a person's birth, social status, or 
                caste membership is of any significance with respect to salvation 
                by means of devotion.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>Equally troubling for Vaisnavas 
                is the <i>Dharmapradipa</i>'s indifference to the issue of persons 
                born in other religions that wish to take up <i>Hindu-dharma</i>. 
                Gaudiya-Vaisnava movements such as ISKCON are mainly composed 
                of devotees born outside of Hindu families. Much earlier, Sri 
                Caitanya himself installed as His <i>namacarya</i>, the 'teacher 
                of the Name', the Muslim-born Haridasa. It is not clear how the 
                <i>Dharmapradipa</i> would deal with such conversions. Halbfass 
                is aware of this problem:<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>'The commitment to the hereditary 
                caste system may be less rigid in the sects than in mainstream

                membership in the religious or soteriological community can be 
                more significant than the hereditary caste membership. Such openness 
                and flexibility is occasionally extended beyond the confines of 
                the Indian world, and even the <i>mlecchas</i> are at times recognised

                  they represent theoretical constructs that attempt to impose 
                  unity on a myriad of different religious systems. The complex 
                  amalgam termed 'Hinduism' encompasses a variety of 'Hinduisms'. 
                  Beginning in the Vedic period and throughout Indian history 
                  the orthodox brahminical tradition has been continually challenged 
                  by competing traditions and movements - local village traditions, 
                  ascetic groups, devotional (<i>bhakti</i>) sects, tantric movements, 
                  and more recently, modern reform movements. While the centripetal 
                  force of brahminical power structures has sought to absorb and 
                  domesticate competing currents, the centrifugal force of these 
                  countervailing centers of power has persisted, giving rise to 
                  that uneasy conglomerate of heterogeneous tendencies which Western 
                  scholars term 'Hinduism' (Holdredge, p. 1).</span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>

              <p class=Purport><span lang=EN-US>Questions instantly arise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>(1) Who speaks for this 'uneasy

                conglomerate of heterogeneous tendencies' speak?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Where shall we find a simple 
                'Hindu' who is neither a Vaisnava, nor a Saiva, nor a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
                </span>Sakta, nor a Tantrika, nor a member of a 'local village 
                tradition', nor a <i>smarta-brahmana, </i>etc.? If our 'Hindu' 
                agrees not to speak for her or his own tradition, and rather speak 
                for 'Hinduism' <i>as a whole,</i> what will the person say?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>And yet, we saw that Caitanya 
                himself, the founder of the Gaudiya-Vaisnava movement, did accept 
                the term 'Hindu' for ordinary dealings with the Muslim rulers. 
                We must keep in mind here the common, contrasting Sanskrit philosophical 
                terms: <i>vyavaharika,</i> 'relating to ordinary or mundane affairs, 
                usage or practice' and <i>paramarthika,</i> 'relating to a spiritual 
                object, or to supreme, essential truth.' It seems fair to say 
                that according to O'Connell's survey of sixteenth to eighteen 
                century Gaudiya Vaisnava literature, the Vaisnava devotees considered 
                themselves Hindu in a <i>vyavaharika</i> sense, but never in a 
                <i>paramarthika</i> sense. Indeed, from the <i>paramarthika</i> 
                viewpoint, 'Hindu' is simply another <i>upadhi</i>, or worldly 
                de-signation. After all, a Hindu may convert to another religion, 
                but on the spiritual platform, the pure soul, <i>atman</i>, can 
                never become anything else in an ontological sense, though the 
                soul may forget its true identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Thus two highly revered and canonical 
                works of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas - Rupa Goswami's <i>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 
                </i>(1.1.12) and Krsndasa Kaviraja's <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i> 
                (2.19.170) - cite the following verse from the <i>Narada-pancaratra</i>(<a href="#7d">7</a>)</span><sup><span lang=EN-US

style='font-size:5.5pt'><a name="7"></a>&nbsp;</span></sup><span lang=EN-US>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>'<i>Bhakti</i> (devotion) is 
                said to be service, with the senses, to the Lord of the senses 
                (Hrsikesa, Krsna), which is freed of all "designations" (<i>upadhi</i>), 
                and immaculate through dedication to Him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Monier-Williams gives these relevant 
                meanings for <i>upadhi</i>: 'that which is put in the place of 
                another thing, a substitute ...; anything which may be taken for 
                or has the mere name or appearance of another thing ... , phantom, 
                disguise.' The sense in which the <i>upadhi</i>, 'Hindu', is a 
                <i>vyavaharika</i> identity for one engaged in self-realisation 
                along Vedantic lines, should be clear upon reflection. Thus the 
                progressive growth of 'Hindu' as a total identity can be understood 
                as the overwhelming of the <i>paramarthika</i>, the ultimate spiritual, 
                identity by the worldly, conventional identity. For the spiritualist, 
                this is a problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps one evidence that the 
                term 'Hindu' is <i>vyavaharika</i>, an <i>upadhi </i>of this world, 
                and of the present body, is that it has often been invoked and 
                engaged to foster communal, even ethnic consciousness and at times 
                communal violence. Thus 'Hindu' transforms itself into an ethnic, 
                even a racial, marker, an engine for national pride, in a way 
                that one would not expect from an eternal, spiritual science that, 
                according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, would apply equally to 
                all living beings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>A historical example may serve 
                to illumine this point. When Gaudiya Vaisnavism was taken seriously 
                in Bengal, it tended to counteract the tendency toward communal 
                conflict, as O'Connell has observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>' ... the Vaisnavas in Bengal 
                did not place their religious commitment in the solidarity of 
                the Hindu people, nor in the sacred ideals, if there were such, 
                common to Hindus. Their religious faith was in Krishna, a mode 
                of faith that in principle a non-Hindu could share ... it would 
                seem, then, either that religiously motivated Hindu communalism 
                is a relatively recent development in Bengal or that the Gaudiya 
                Vaisnavas are atypical. My own opinion is that so long as the 
                Gaudiya Vaisnavas remained the pace-setting religious and literary 
                group in Bengal, i.e. to the turn of the nineteenth century, their 
                point of view prevailed in Bengal well beyond their own movement. 
                With the partial breakdown of Gaudiya-Vaisnava faith, self-assurance 
                and influence in the nineteenth century, due in part to the criticisms 
                by reformers, this Vaisnava resistance to religiously motivated 
                communal consciousness by Hindus was eroded.' (<i>JOC, </i>p. 
                342)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>Among the minimum beliefs one 
                must have to be a legal Hindu in India, the Supreme Court includes 
                'Acceptance of great world rhythm - vast periods of creation, 
                maintenance and dissolution follow each other in endless succession 
                - by all six systems of Hindu philosophy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>It is fair to say that within 
                the 'vast periods of creation, maintenance and dissolution', the 
                existence of the term 'Hindu' occupies but a geo-blip of time. 
                Missing altogether in Vedic discourse, as well as in later Sanskrit 
                epic, Puranic, and Vedantic disquisitions, the term comes to be 
                used self-referentially in more recent times in vernacular literatures. 
                Even that limited use is further limited to discourse with or 
                for a hostile 'other'. Finally, in modern times, in contact with 
                the West, 'Hindu' and 'Hinduism', in their various neo- and conservative 
                shapes, emerge as quasi-ethnic, exclusivistic self-references, 
                with and for those believing that the Vedic literature is sacred 
                and authoritative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
              <p class=purppara><span lang=EN-US>This dramatic shift is troubling 
                for those Vaisnavas who take seriously the traditional teachings 
                of the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> and the 
                devotional version of <i>Vedanta,</i> to the effect that every 
                living being is ultimately an eternal servant of a supreme personal 
                God. Vaisnavas are even more unhappy with the constant neo-Hindu 
                subordination of Krsna's personal form to the impersonal, <i>nirguna 
                </i>ideal of <i>advaita-vedanta</i>. On <i>paramarthika </i>issues, 
                a serious Vaisnava would not dream of appointing a generic 'Hindu' 
                as a spokesperson. Thus, in a purely spiritual context, for whom 
                does Hinduism speak?<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
