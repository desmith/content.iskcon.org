              Svarupa Dasa</a></h2>
            <h4 class="maintextsubhead"> A paper presented at the Conference '30 
              Jahre ISKCON Deutschland', K&ouml;ln, Germany, 29 January 1999.</h4>
            <p> <i>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa (Dr William H. Deadwyler, III), an early 
              disciple of Srila Prabhupada, here looks at one of Prabhupada's 
              more controversial directives; the need to establish varnasrama-dharma 
              (the organisation of society according to the quality and work of 
              the members of the society). He looks at the internal logic of the 
              varnasrama system and then describes some of the understandings 
              of that system which have arisen in ISKCON. The question of how 
              to establish varnasrama-dharma in a modern context has been the 
              source of a longstanding debate within ISKCON, and in this paper 
              Ravindra Svarupa contributes to the debate with his analysis of 
              the situation. This analysis focuses on the </i><i>need to encourage 
              a brahminical (intellectual) class within society - a brain for 
              the social body.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>On the eleventh of July, 1966, in New York, Srila Prabhupada 
              incorporated the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. 
              By then, Prabhupada had already discovered an audience for his exposition 
              of <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>, an expositon he characterised as 'a 
              cultural presentation for the respiritualisation of the entire human 
              society' (<i>Bhag.</i> Canto 1, Preface). In a further step toward 
              the culture of 'respiritualisation', he established ISKCON. ISKCON 
              was to be an exemplary society, within which the culture of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 
              would be realised and by which it would be spread to the rest of 
              the world.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>While that much has always been bedrock truth to ISKCON's 
              members, it is a fact that over ISKCON's thirty-three years, their 
              ideas of what exactly ISKCON is, in terms of its internal articulation, 
              and of how it should relate itself to the surrounding society have 
              been fluid. The ideas of its members have undergone changes. It 
              seems that even Prabhupada's ideas changed. 
            <p align=LEFT>The reason for this unsettled state has to do with the 
              accommodations that theory must make to reality. This is recognised 
              in Prabhupada's own tradition by the maxim that even Absolute Truth 
              must be fine-tuned to the relativities of <i>desa-kala-patra </i>- 
              'the circumstantial environments of place, object and time' (<i>Bhag.</i>1.6.26-30, 
              purport). The often hard-won expertise in doing this is what we 
              call 'wisdom' (in Sanskrit, <i>vijnana</i>). In the application 
              of principle to practice we frequently must have recourse to the 
              method of 'trial-and-error.' 'You learn from experience,' Prabhupada 
              is often quoted as saying. 'And experience means you make mistakes.' 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>I hope to acquaint the reader with part of the history 
              of our experience, of our mistakes. I hope you will also find exhibited 
              herein the beginnings of a little hard-won wisdom. I also hope you 
              will get a fair idea of some of the difficulties we are confronting. 
            <p align=LEFT>To understand these matters, one needs to become acquainted 
              with two contrasting social ideals, or models, transmitted to us 
              by Srila Prabhupada. The first is that of a society of Vaisnavas, 
              of transcendental, liberated devotees who conduct themselves spontaneously 
              in accord with the principles called <i>sanatana-dharma</i>. The 
              second is that of a society of materially conditioned human beings 
              who strictly conduct themselves in obedience to the injunctions 
              of the <i>Vedas </i> under the system called <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>To understand both systems, we need to be clear about 
              what is meant when we say that someone is bound or conditioned, 
              on the one hand, and liberated or transcendental, on the other. 
              This is presented clearly in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (the entire 
              fourteenth chapter is devoted to this exposition). To be a bound 
              or conditioned soul means to be bound or conditioned by the three 
              <i>gunas</i>, or 'modes' of material nature; they are termed <i>sattva-guna, 
              </i> the mode of goodness, or purity; <i>rajo-guna,</i> the mode 
              of passion; and <i>tamo-guna</i>, the mode of ignorance, or darkness. 
            <p align=LEFT>The three modes are most readily recognisable in the 
              tripartite cycle of nature: We see that things come into being, 
              they endure for a while, and then they undergo destruction. Then 
              the products of destruction furnish the raw material for a new phase 
              of creation as the cycle begins again. In the Vedic understanding, 
              these three phases exemplify fundamental categories for understanding 
              the material world. When things are being created, nature is said 
              to be acting in the mode of passion, <i>rajo-guna</i>. When things 
              are being maintained, nature is acting in the mode of goodness, 
              <i>sattva-guna</i>. And when things are undergoing destruction, 
              nature is acting in the mode of ignorance, <i>tamo-guna</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT> According to the <i>Bhagavad-gita, </i>these same modes 
              also function to determine, or condition, the human personality. 
              Thus we have a three-fold psychological typology. The mode of goodness 
              is manifest by an attitude that is detached, dispassionate and interested 
              in knowledge for its own sake. The mode of passion is evident in 
              the hankering and longings that impel strenuous efforts to obtain 
              objects of desire. The mode of ignorance is manifest in apathy, 
              indifference, obliviousness and bewilderment. When, for example, 
              consciousness is conditioned by <i>sattva-guna,</i> it will be alert 
              and attentive (toward nearly any subject presented) and, at the 
              same time, detached and disinterested. Consciousness conditioned 
              by <i>rajo-guna </i>is excited and narrowly focused upon the object 
              of desire. Consciousness conditioned by <i>tamo-guna </i>is unaware, 
              inattentive, easily distracted and disposed toward chronic misperception. 
            <p align=LEFT>I suspect that most of us can recognise these three 
              psychological states from our own experience. We have probably spent 
              some time in each of the modes. All three modes are present in each 
              person, and among them there is always 'a competition for supremacy,' 
              as the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>(14.10) says. Nevertheless, there is 
              a tendency for a particular mode or combination of modes to predominate 
              in a given individual, conducting him in its own programmatic manner 
              to its characteristic end. Thus, the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> says that 
              the mode of goodness conditions a person to happiness or satisfaction, 
              and it results in knowledge. The mode of passion conditions one 
              to selfishly motivated activity, and it results in misery (because 
              passionate desires never cease multiplying and goading us into action, 
              never producing satisfaction). The mode of ignorance binds one to 
              delusion, and it results in systematic delusion or madness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada characterised the three 'pure types' of the 
              modes like this: 'One is happy, another is very active, and another 
              is helpless' (<i>Bg.</i> 14.6, purport). 
            <p align=LEFT>We have all encountered various organised structures 
              of thought - whether cultural, philosophical, religious, scientific 
              or ideological - which present systems of abstract categories by 
              means of which we can apprehend and understand the world. When we 
              school ourselves in such a system - often trying to get inside of 
              it by the method of sympathetic projection or <i>Hineinfühlung</i> 
              - we sometimes find that the system illuminates or makes intelligible 
              certain areas of experience that we had not before particularly 
              noticed or considered relevant. If we then apply that system to 
              our practical endeavours and find ourselves newly enabled to deal 
              with the world in a manner that seems consistently fruitful and 
              productive, we award the system that highest of accolades, we call 
              it <i>truth</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>Thus it was for me - and many devotees - with the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> 
              as Prabhupada presented it. I looked at society - and at myself 
              - through the lenses of the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> and once the <i>gunas 
              </i>had been pointed out, I could see them plainly. While these 
              categories might not be fruitful to the endeavours of an atomic 
              scientist or an agronomist, say, they were indeed germane to the 
              goal of most who were attracted to ISKCON: We were seeking liberation, 
              transcendence. And transcendence meant, concretely, to transcend 
              the modes of material nature. This was possible, Prabhupada said, 
              for anyone: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>... if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness 
                and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion ... . Although 
                there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined 
                he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and by transcending 
                the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness, which 
                is called the <i>vasudeva </i> state, a state in which one can 
                understand the science of God.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <p align=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Bg.</i> 14.10, purport) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The initial result of the proper culture of Krsna consciousness 
              should be the disappearance in the practitioner of the symptoms 
              of the modes of ignorance and passion. Lust, greed, anger, and the 
              like should vanish from the heart. In this way, one becomes established 
              in the mode of goodness. The mode of goodness is the existential 
              condition necessary for a person to be able to understand and experience 
              spiritual reality. Thus the mode of goodness is the material platform, 
              the launching pad, as it were, from which one can make the final 
              voyage into transcendence, where there is neither creation nor destruction, 
              but everlasting existence, or, in other words, pure, unalloyed <i>sattva</i>. 
            <p>In this way, the theory of the modes provided devotees a road map 
              of the material world, with the way out clearly marked. 
            <p align=LEFT>The theory of the modes also provided the basis for 
              another set of categories, that of the four <i>varnas</i>. Just 
              as the human body is equipped by nature with head, arms, belly, 
              and legs, so the social body is constituted by the four occupational 
              groups: the <i>brahmanas,</i> who comprise the thinkers and teachers 
              (head); the <i>ksatriyas </i>- the governors and protectors (arms); 
              the <i>vaisyas</i> - the producers and traders (belly); and the 
              <i> sudras</i> - the workers and general assistants (legs). Every 
              society requires the specific contribution of these specialists 
              in thinking, governing, producing and working. Krsna states in the 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (4.13) that this ordering is generated by God, 
              in such a way that each person is naturally disposed toward a particular 
              category by virtue of <i>guna</i> (the controlling mode of nature) 
              and <i>karma</i> (specialised activity and means of livelihood). 
            <p align=LEFT>The system in which <i>guna </i>and <i>karma</i> thus 
              determine <i>varna </i>is called <i>daiva-varnasrama-dharma</i>, 
              the divinely established system. Prabhupada explicitly contrasts 
              this godly system with the standard Hindu caste system, in which 
              birth is the sole determinant of membership; Prabhupada calls that 
              <i>asura-varnasrama-dharma</i>, or the diabolically created system 
              (see, e.g., the purport to <i>Cc.</i> Madhya 3.6). Prabhupada and 
              his predecessor teachers condemned this hereditary system as a corruption 
              of the authentic system, viewing it as the major source of social 
              injustice and turmoil in India. In several lectures Prabhupada even 
              traces the cause of the partitioning of India back to the injustices 
              spawned by the degraded principle of 'hereditary brahmanism' (see, 
              e.g., lecture on <i>Bhag.</i> 1.2.2: Rome, 26 May 1974). 
            <p align=LEFT>A <i>brahmana </i>must factually be in the mode of goodness, 
              for <i>varna </i>is determined by <i>guna</i>. A good way to think 
              of the system is to imagine the <i> gunas </i>distributed along 
              a continuum, with goodness at one end, ignorance at the other, and 
              passion in the middle. At a somewhat arbitrary line when goodness 
              becomes sufficiently mixed with passion the demarcation between 
              <i>brahmana</i> and <i>ksatriya</i> occurs. Similarly, when passion 
              becomes sufficiently mixed with ignorance, there is a demarcation 
              between <i>ksatriya</i> and <i>vaisya</i>. When ignorance sufficiently 
              predominates over passion there is a division between <i>vaisya</i> 
              and <i>sudra</i>. The individuals situated in the boundary regions 
              could, in principle, be occupationally engaged on one side or the 
              other, according to variables such as education, training or aptitude. 
            <p align=LEFT>The categories of the <i>gunas</i> and of the <i>varnas</i> 
              are important in understanding what Prabhupada conceived as a primary 
              social mission of ISKCON. Once in the early 1970s I was present 
              when the press interviewed Prabhupada after his arrival at a New 
              York airport. A reporter asked, 'Why have you come to the West?' 
              'I have come', Prabhupada replied, 'to give you a brain. Your society', 
              he continued, 'is headless.' Using the analogy of the human body, 
              he explained the articulation of human society into four <i>varnas</i>. 
              He then asserted that modern Western society was malformed. 'There 
              are a few <i>vaisyas</i> and everyone else is <i>sudra</i>.' In 
              other words, those now engaged in research and education, in government 
              and defence, are, knowingly or unknowingly, in the employ of a handful 
              of <i>vaisyas</i>. (Prabhupada's perception is perhaps supported 
              by the report that in America, five percent of the families now 
              control ninety percent of the wealth.) There are no proper <i>brahmanas</i> 
              or <i>ksatriyas</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada's intention was to re-create a class of genuine 
              <i>brahmanas</i>. This would help rectify the deformities of modern 
              society and ameliorate the spiritual, psychological, social, political 
              and ecological problems spawned by a hypertrophy of economic development 
              and other outgrowths of unrestrained <i>rajo-guna</i>. Prabhupada 
              notes: 'Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the 
              standard of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition 
              was considered to be in the mode of goodness' (<i>Bg.</i> 14.7, 
              purport). Genuine <i> brahmanas</i>, he hoped, would help reset 
              the priorities of advanced civilisation. 
            <p align=LEFT>Yet Prabhupada's mission of creating <i>brahmanas</i> 
              was in a sense derivative, a kind of automatic by-product of the 
              primary mission of producing Vaisnavas. The word <i>vaisnava </i>in 
              the strictest sense denotes a pure devotee of God, one who is accordingly 
              transcendental to all the modes of nature. <i>Brahmanas</i>, however, 
              are conditioned by the mode of goodness, and Prabhupada wanted to 
              produce liberated souls. Such liberated Vaisnavas are more advanced 
              than even <i> brahmanas</i>. Nevertheless, in society his Vaisnavas 
              would function primarily as <i>brahmanas</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>It should be recognised that historically speaking the 
              Vaisnava<i> </i>traditions in India have all propagated a socially 
              and spiritually radical teaching. Vaisnavism fostered the spiritual 
              enfranchisement of previously disenfranchised groups, and, in so 
              doing, undercut the spiritual (and social) prerogatives of the hereditary 
              brahminical caste. Hence in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (9.32) Krsna 
              cites groups traditionally considered unqualified for spiritual 
              advancement - he mentions women, <i>vaisyas</i> and <i>sudras</i> 
              - and says that by practising devotion to Him they can 'attain the 
              supreme destination.' In the <i>Bhagavatam</i> (3.33.6) it is stated 
              that even an outcaste (s<i>vadah </i>- a dog-eater), if engaging 
              in devotional practices, becomes immediately qualified to perform 
              Vedic sacrifice (traditionally, of course, the monopoly of <i>brahmana 
              </i>males). 
            <p align=LEFT>Such statements reflect the conviction that <i>bhakti-yoga, 
              </i> devotional service to Krsna, is so spiritually powerful that 
              it can quickly uplift even the most morally and spiritually debased 
              people. Thus facilitated, one does not need to spend many lifetimes 
              transmigrating up the caste hierarchy to reach the brahminical platform. 
              <i>Bhakti-yoga </i>can take <i>sudras, </i>and those even less qualified, 
              and transform them into Vaisnavas and <i>brahmanas</i>. Prabhupada's 
              own Bengali Vaisnava tradition, as reformed by Caitanya at the beginning 
              of the sixteenth century, paid great respect to this spiritual egalitarianism. 
              So schooled, Prabhupada came to try out this principle in the West 
              - in the United States in the 1960s. It was, of necessity, a kind 
              of experiment. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada discovered, rather to his surprise, that 
              the main audience for his teachings tended to be drawn from the 
              counterculture, and Prabhupada was not impressed by the counterculture. 
              He described hippies in various places as 'morose' (<i>Bhag.</i> 
              4.25.11, purport), 'distressed', 'wretched', 'unclean', 'without 
              shelter or food' (<i>Bhag.</i> 4.25.5, purport), 'irresponsible 
              and unregulated' (<i>Bhag.</i> 5.6.10, purport) 'lying idle, without 
              any production' (<i>Bg.</i> lecture, 1976), and so on. We should 
              recognise this as a precise catalogue of the characteristics of 
              <i>tamo-guna,</i> the mode of ignorance. When, in 1971, Prabhupada 
              remarked to Kenneth Keating, the then American ambassador to India, 
              that his service to America was 'turning hippies into happies' (Letter 
              to Damodara: 3 December, 1971), Prabhupada was, in a witticism, 
              stating that he was taking people in the mode of ignorance and elevating 
              them to the mode of goodness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Early after his arrival in America, Prabhupada wrote 
              of his mission in these terms: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Though a person be even the most sinful man, he can at once be 
                purified by sys<strike>-</strike>tematic contact with a pure Vaisnava. 
                A Vaisnava, therefore, can accept a bona fide disciple from any 
                part of the world without any consideration of caste and creed 
                and promote him by regulative principles to the status of a pure 
                Vaisnava who is transcendental to brahminical culture. The system 
                of caste, or <i> varnasrama-dharma</i>, is no longer regular even 
                amongst the so-called followers of the system. Nor is it now possible 
                to re-establish the institutional function in the present context 
                of social, political and economic revolution. Without any reference 
                to the particular custom of a country, one can be accepted to 
                the Vaisnava cult spiritually, and there is no hindrance in the 
                transcendental process.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <p align=RIGHT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Bhag.</i> 2.4.18, purport) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Here, Prabhupada expresses his doubts about the feasibility 
              of a <i>varnasrama </i>system. Yet even without it, he thought he 
              could produce Vaisnavas who could perform the brahminical function 
              of spiritual guide to the people. He makes the same points emphatically 
              in an early <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> lecture: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>So at the present moment, there is no possibility 
                of persons following the principles of <i>varnasrama-dharma,</i> 
                either here or anywhere ... . Therefore this is the panacea, to 
                engage everyone in <i> Krsna</i> consciousness, chanting Hare 
                Krsna. He comes above the highest principle of brahmanism. This 
                is the greatest gift to the humanity, that even [if] he is in 
                ... the most degraded position, he can be raised to the highest 
                position simply by chanting. This is the only remedy. Now you 
                cannot again introduce this system of <i>varnasrama</i>. It is 
                not possible. But if one takes to Krsna consciousness, automatically 
                he becomes immediately a <i>brahmana </i>and above the <i>brahmanas</i>. 
                A Vaisnava is above the <i>brahmanas</i>.

            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>It is also clear that by 1974, Prabhupada had changed 
              his mind about instituting the <i>varnasrama</i>-system. One major 
              reason for his doing so is clearly disclosed in this 1977 conversation 
              concerning a <i>sannyasi </i>who had fallen down from his celibacy 
              vows: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT><b>Prabhupada: </b>Just like our [name withheld]. 
                He was not fit for <i>sannyasa </i>but he was given <i>sannyasa</i>. 
                And five women he was attached, and he disclosed. Therefore <i>varnasrama-dharma 
                </i>is required. Simply show-bottle will not do. So the <i>varnas-rama-dharma 
                </i>should be introduced all over the world, and - 
              <p align=LEFT><b>Satsvarupa:</b> Introduced starting with ISKCON

              <p align=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Room Conversation: Mayapura, 14 February 
                1977) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>It had become clear to Prabhupada, after some years 
              of experience in the West, that the elevation of his followers to 
              the brahminical platform of goodness, what to speak of the Vaisnava 
              transcendental platform, was not going to happen universally or 
              swiftly. His earliest hopes were unfulfilled. 
            <p align=LEFT>Since the time Prabhupada began speaking extensively 
              about implementing <i>varnasrama dharma,</i> there has been much 
              discussion in ISCKON on the way to go about it. I can report that 
              there is still little, if any, consensus. In 1981 one leader, convinced 
              that 'after ten years of rigorous thought' he had it figured out, 
              published what he considered an authoritative 215-page book to persuade 
              'the intelligent leaders and thinkers of modern society' to embrace 
              the <i>varnasrama </i>revolution. The <i>Varnasrama Manifesto for 
              Social Sanity</i> by Harikesa Swami is, I find, spectacularly unpersuasive, 
              and I can best characterise it by borrowing Alan Greenspan's phrase 
              'irrational exuberance.' This now famous expression was used by 
              the American Federal Reserve Chairman to describe market investors 
              in the grip of a foolish and dangerous over-confidence. The phrase 
              aptly fits this so-called <i>Manifesto</i>. It should be noted that 
              the work was so controversial within ISKCON that ISKCON's Governing 
              Body Commission - of which Harikesa Swami was a member - passed 
              a resolution in 1982 disowning the work, stating that it 'represents 
              the realisation of the author and does not represent the official 
              view or policies of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.' 
              And in 1996, the author himself issued an apologetic statement that 
              concluded, 'I have grown and matured in my conceptions and also 
              become more realistic and less idealistic in my viewpoint. Therefore 
              even I do not stand anymore behind some of the concepts mentioned 
              in the book and I feel sorry that I wrote some of the things that 
              I wrote.' 
            <p align=LEFT>I also have my own views on the application of <i>varnasrama-dharma,</i> 
              for I too have thought about the subject, but I assure you, that 
              whatever I speak or write will not go uncontested by someone else 
              in ISKCON. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Nevertheless, I will venture here to propose the 
              major reasons why ISKCON is hav-<br>
              ing such a difficult time coming to grips with this matter. The 
              first and foremost is that ISKCON - I put it starkly - has no brain. 
              Or, at least the brain it has is underdeveloped. 
            <p

                             align=LEFT>You will recall that Prabhupada originally 
              thought that ISKCON would perform the brahminical function for the 
              rest of society - 'I have come to give you a brain.' Prabhupada 
              based this effort on books. By books he could transmit the Vedic 
              heritage, and through books he could instruct and train large numbers 
              of followers, who, by studying his writings systematically and practising 
              their teachings, could advance to the mode of goodness and beyond. 
              At the same time, by having those same followers distribute the 
              books to others, Prabhupada would engage them in preaching to the 
              general public. Book distribution is one type of <i> sankirtana</i>, 
              congregational glorification of God, and <i>sankirtana </i>is described 
              in scripture as the particular form of sacrifice authorised for 
              this age. Moreover, devotees would be able to maintain themselves 
              and their activities by donations received through book distribution. 
              In this way, ISKCON members would perform the six engagements enjoined 
              upon a <i>brahmana</i>: <i>yajana, yajana, pathana, pathana, dana 
              </i>and <i> pratigraha</i>. A <i>brahmana</i> performs sacrifice 
              and engages others in sacrifice, studies the Vedas and teaches the 
              Vedas, gives in charity and receives in charity. 
            <p align=LEFT>We have already noted Prabhupada's disappointment when 
              many devotees turned out to have great difficulty in steadily following 
              the strict principles of Krsna consciousness. Another related difficulty, 
              was also noted by Prabhupada. For example, this exchange took place 
              during a 1972 lecture: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT><b>Prabhupada</b>: Similarly, the GBC member means 
                they will see that in every temple these books are very thoroughly 
                being read and discussed and understood and applied in practical 
                life. That is wanted, not to see the vouchers only, 'How many 
                books you have sold, and how many books are in the stock?' That 
                is secondary. ... Now, suppose you go to sell some book and if 
                somebody says, 'You have read this book? Can you explain this 
                verse?' then what you will say? You will say, 'No. It is for you. 
                It is not for me. I have to take money from you. That's all.' 
                Is that very nice answer? 
              <p align=LEFT><b>Devotee: </b> No, Srila Prabhupada. 
              <p align=LEFT><b>Prabhupada:</b> Then? 'We have written this book 
                for your reading, not for our reading. We are simply collect money.' 
                That's all.

            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada often brought up the point when a devotee 
              seemed ignorant of a verse: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Do you remember, any one of you, this verse from the 
                <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>? Eh? But you don't read. So I am writing 
                all these books simply for selling, not for reading. This is not 
                good. And if somebody asks you, 'You are so much eager to sell 
                your books. Do you read your books?' Then what you will say? 'No, 
                sir, we don't read. We sell only. Our Guru Maharaja writes, and 
                we sell.' That is not good business. You must read. Why I am writing

              America tended to become less and less of a brahminical preaching 
              activity and more and more of a <i>vaisya</i> commercial activity, 
              with books eventually being replaced by secular paraphernalia. This 
              shift from preaching <br>
              to fund-raising after Srila Prabhupada's demise has been well documented 
              by E. Burke Rochford in <i> Hare Krishna in America </i>(New Brunswick: 
              Rutgers University Press, 1986). While the movement prospered financially, 
              it declined spiritually. Prabhupada's misgivings proved sound. 
            <p align=LEFT>In 1987 ISKCON in America fortunately changed course. 
              The North American leaders resolved to stop all sales of secular 
              items by the temples and to return them to what was, in effect, 
              a brahminical mode of maintenance, depending mainly upon donations 
              from the congregation and working residents. All the temples in 
              North America quickly went broke. However, there has been since 
              then a slow but steady recovery, both spiritual and financial. Both 
              depend, in my view, on turning the temples into exemplary brahminical 
              institutions. The brief history I have recounted illustrates the 
              truth - and the prescience - of Prabhupada's perception. 
            <p align=LEFT>Let me note another important indication of ISKCON's 
              failure to organise brahminical training. In 1976 Prabhupada ordered 
              a gradated system of examinations to be instituted in ISKCON. To 
              this day this order is unfulfilled. 
            <p align=LEFT> From a letter Prabhupada had his secretary send out 
              to the GBC to convey his directions: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Re: Examinations for awarding titles of Bhakti-sastri, 
                Bhakti-vaibhava, Bhakti-vedanta and Bhakti-sarvabhauma. 
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>... Srila Prabhupada has requested me to write you 
                in regard to the above examinations which he wishes to institute. 
                Here in India many persons often criticise our <i>sannyasis</i> 
                and <i>brahmanas</i> as being unqualified due to insufficient 
                knowledge of the scriptures. Factually, there are numerous instances 
                when our <i>sannyasis</i> and <i>brahmanas</i> have fallen down 
                often due to insufficient understanding of the philosophy. This 
                should not be a point of criticism nor a reason for falldown, 
                since Srila Prabhupada has mercifully made the most essential 
                scriptures available to us in his books. The problem is that not 
                all the devotees are carefully studying the books, the result 
                being a fall down or at least unsteadiness. 
              <p align=LEFT>His Divine Grace therefore wishes to institute examinations 
                to be given to all prospective candidates for <i>sannyasa </i>and 
                <i>brahmana </i>initiation. In addition he wishes that all present 
                <i>sannyasis </i>and <i>brahmanas </i>also pass the examination. 
                Awarding of these titles will be based upon the following books: 
              <p align=LEFT>Bhakti-sastri - <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>, <i>Nectar of 
                Devotion</i>, <i>Nectar of Instruction</i>, <i>Isopanisad</i>, 
                <i>Easy Journey To Other Planets</i>, and all other small paperbacks, 
                as well as <i>Arcana-paddhati </i>(a book to be compiled by Nitai 
                Prabhu based on <i>Hari-bhakti-vilasa </i>on Deity worship) 
              <p align=LEFT>Bhakti-vaibhava - All of the above plus the first 
                six cantos of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i> 
              <p

                                 align=LEFT>Bhakti-vedanta - All of the above 
                plus cantos seven through twelve of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i> 
              <p align=LEFT>Bhakti-sarvabhauma - All the above plus the entire 
                <i> Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. 
              <p align=LEFT>Anyone wishing to be initiated as a <i>brahmana</i> 
                will have to pass the Bhakti-sastri exam and anyone wishing to 
                take <i>sannyasa</i> will have to pass the Bhakti-vaibhava examination 
                as well. This will prevent our Society from degrading to the level 
                of so many other institutions where, in order to maintain the 
                Temple, they accept all third class men as <i>brahmanas</i>. Any 
                <i>sannyasis </i>or <i>brahmanas </i>already initiated who fail 
                to pass the exams will be considered low class or less qualified. 
                Anyone wishing to be second initiated will sit for examination 
                once a year at Mayapura. Answers will be in essay form and authoritative 
                quotations will be given a bigger score. During the exams books 
                may not be consulted. 
              <p align=LEFT>Srila Prabhupada wishes to begin this program at this 
                year's Mayapura meeting. He requests that you all send your opinions 
                and comments here immediately so that everything may be prepared 
                in time. 
              <p align=RIGHT> Letter to 'All Governing Body Commissioners'</p>
              <p align=RIGHT> ( Nellore, South India, 6 January 1976) </p>
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>A Bhakti-sastri examination was held in Mayapura in 
              1977 (a year late), but after Prabhupada's demise later that same 
              year, the examinations soon disappeared. Only within in the last 
              five years or so have Bhakti-sastri courses and examinations been 
              regularised in some places in ISKCON. To this day neither curricula 
              nor examinations exist for the other three degrees. 
            <p align=LEFT>Finally, let me briefly note a second major reason ISKCON 
              has had difficulty understanding and instituting <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>. 
              This is the fact that the system can neither be understood nor practised 
              within the material and conceptual framework of an industrial society. 
              Prabhupada taught that the modern industrial economy was artificial, 
              unnatural, and harmful to the human and non-human world. In one 
              way or another it would one day have to be sized-down and scaled 
              back. Humanity would have to develop a new economy, in which the 
              family would be restored as a unit of production and in which local 
              self-sufficiency - most importantly in the matter of food supply 
              - would become a major value. Therefore, from the very beginning 
              Prabhupada wanted ISKCON to establish self-sufficient, rural communities, 
              not only to construct the material basis necessary for <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>, 
              but also to provide working examples of an alternative when the 
              inevitable transition to a neo-agrarian economy began to impose 
              itself upon the industrialised world. 
            <p align=LEFT>ISKCON has established a number of these rural communities 
              in advanced industrial countries. Many devotees have moved to them 
              to 'learn to live off the land' and practise 'plain living and high 
              thinking.' Yet over the course of time these projects have evolved 
              largely into suburban-style Hare Krsna communities. We still await 
              the self-sufficient agrarian community in practice. Although there 
              are social and economic reasons why this ideal has failed in practice, 
              I suspect a necessary condition for its future success will be the 
              contribution of genuine <i>brahmanas</i>, whose creation is still 
              ISKCON's unfulfilled mission. 
            <p align=LEFT>My proposal, therefore, for establishing <i> varnasrama-dharma 
              </i>in ISKCON, and even in the society at large, is first of all 
              to take the first step and do everything needed to form a proper 
              community of <i>brahmanas</i>. According to <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              (18.42), two of the traits evinced by <i>brahmanas</i> are <i>jnana 
              </i>and <i>vijnana</i>, that is, they have genuine knowledge of 
              the Absolute Truth and they posses the wisdom to apply that knowledge 
              appropriately. If this first step is taken, and ISKCON is thus given 
              a brain, then I am sure we shall be in a better position to know 
              where to go further. 
            <p align=LEFT>I am happy to report that a movement is gaining strength 
              among the leaders to make ISKCON an organisation primarily dedicated 
              to education and training. If we continue in this way, I am sure 
              we will become eligible to receive Prabhupada's legacy and empowered 
              to convey it to the rest of humankind.
