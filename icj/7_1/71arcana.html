              Dasi</a></h3>
            <p> <i>In this article, Arcana Dasi (Alice Schumann) looks at the 
              road ISKCON Germany has travelled since the 1994 Wiesbaden conference. 
              At Wiesbaden, several principles for change were established, such 
              as the need for self-critical analysis; the need for social in-tegration; 
              a willingness to engage in dialogue; and a recognition of ISKCON's 
              need to fulfil its educational mission. Arcana Dasi examines where 
              ISKCON Germany is today in relation to the Wiesbaden principles, 
              and notes the issues facing the Society in Germany after the recent 
              fall of its most prominent leader. This article is a milestone in 
              the self-analysis of a national ISKCON branch. The paper was initially 
              given as a speech at a 1999 conference in Cologne marking thirty 
              years of ISKCON in Germany.</i></p>
            <p>In 1994 the Academy of Vaisnava Culture organised a conference 
              in Wiesbaden (R&uuml;ckblick und Ausblick / Retrospect and Prospects). 
              This conference was a significant landmark in the history of ISKCON 
              Germany because for the first time ISKCON members publicly and honestly 
              addressed issues of social concern as perceived by those outside 
              of our tradition. 
            <p> A number of principles were outlined at this conference, principles 
              that would enable ISKCON to function effectively in society and 
              that would reflect the changing face of ISKCON itself. 
            <p> A major principle was the need for social integration. It was 
              found that we need to improve our relationship with the public and 
              to understand that this relationship would have to be based on mutual 
              understanding and co-operation if it were to endure. This principle 
              of co-operation would particularly apply to the basic building block 
              of society - the family. ISKCON would have to recognise the importance 
              of spiritually oriented families as well as the concern of family 
              members who are not ISKCON devotees themselves. 
            <p> Another principle, a necessary by-product of the first, is the 
              need for dialogue with the wider community. Such dialogue can exist 
              only if ISKCON members give the same appreciation and respect for 
              members of others faiths and cultures that they would want for themselves. 
              This is an opportunity to learn and to teach. 
            <p> Self-critical analysis was also a major principle: the need for 
              ISKCON to have a long and honest look at itself and where it is 
              going. How do we address pressing issues, such as sexual and other 
              types of discrimination? What is the role of the temple and who 
              should (or should not) be living there? How are the material needs 
              of our members being met and to what extent is it our responsibility 
              as a society to meet them? As a subset of a wider society, ISKCON 
              needs to address these and many other questions; at Wiesbaden it 
              was acknowledged that this would best be achieved by honest reflection 
              and discussion. 
            <p> A need to fulfil our role as an educational organisation was also 
              accepted at the Wiesbaden conference. It was recognised that ISKCON 
              was becoming more of a congregational movement than a temple-based 
              communal movement. Therefore the role of the temple would need to 
              change from that of a home to all devotees to that of a centre for 
              devotion, training and communication - a facility for the ISKCON's 
              new majority, the congregation. 
            <p> Five years later we ask: What progress has been made in ISKCON's 
              development of society, culture and identity? In what sense has 
              ISKCON Germany actually realised its need for social integration? 
              Have the projections and proposed principles of Wiesbaden become 
              reality? Will they make for significant changes in the comparatively 
              young Society in Germany? 
            <p> Since the Wiesbaden conference much appreciation has been shown 
              for the declarations of ISKCON's representatives and for the open 
              analysis of its past by devotees and scholars. However, many also 
              believe that it still remains for ISKCON to show that it can turn 
              good intentions into practical action. 
            <p> I will examine here how ISKCON has responded to challenges to 
              these principles when circumstances have forced it to face adversity.</p>
            <p> 
            <h5> <b>Education</b></h5>
            <p>The role of education in ISKCON continues to shape the future of 
              the society since Wiesbaden. The direction outlined in the Wiesbaden 
              conference concerning education within and outside of ISKCON has 
              been generally realised over the last five years, and ISKCON's culture 
              of education has been strengthened. 
            <p> In 1997 ISKCON's role as an institution with a primary focus on 
              education was confirmed when its German National Council (NC) agreed 
              to take the Vaisnava Training &amp; Education <a href="#1d">(1)</a><a name="1"></a> 
              (VTE) Teachers' Training Courses. The rationale behind this was 
              that the experience of teaching and being taught would help ISKCON's 
              management make education-friendly decisions for ISKCON. The example 
              set by ISKCON's leaders would also inspire other members to take 
              education more seriously. 
            <p> By aligning itself with the VTE and the ISKCON Ministry of Educational 
              Development <a href="#2d">(2)</a><a name="2"></a> (MED), ISKCON 
              Germany has linked itself to international developments in education 
              in the Vaisnava community. The VTE team is developing courses, including 
              Teacher Training, Management and Leadership, Communications, Missionary 
              Practice, Scripture, Pastoral Care and Care for the Sick &amp; Dying. 
            <p> Many of these courses are being developed in Oxford, England, 
              where the VTE has its base. By working in co-operation with British 
              educational consultants and government agencies, the VTE is working 
              towards official accreditation for many of its courses. 
            <p> As stated in the Wiesbaden conference, ISKCON centres and temples 
              are places of mission and of worship for the community.<a href="#3d">(3)</a><a name="3"></a> 
              In Germany the educational role is being concentrated in one or 
              two temples, which are developing into the country's first Vaisnava 
              Theological Schools. To qualify for entrance for residential (asrama) 
              training, members go through preliminary examinations and interviews. 
              The duration of their stay in the temple is dictated by the length 
              of their educational course. After their course of education most 
              are expected and encouraged to return to their homes and employment 
              or occupational education. 
            <p> Selected students are offered training for ministry, and of those 
              who qualify from the two-year ministerial training course, some 
              are offered staff positions as teachers, tutors, priests or administrators 
              in the temples. Thus permanent temple staff accept a vocational 
              position while the missionary spirit of the preacher is still being 
              encouraged in each and every ISKCON member. The membership being 
              considered here includes both a lay and a clerical congregation. 
            <p> This focus on education is revolutionising the way ISKCON sees 
              itself and the way it plans its future recruitment and training 
              programmes. It is also a natural extension of ISKCON's policy of 
              social integration.</p>
            <p> 
            <h5> <b>ISKCON Meeting Society</b></h5>
            <p>The vast majority of ISKCON's members have never lived in temples, 
              left their employment or interrupted their education. The old image 
              of the Hare Krsna devotee leaving education or employment to live 
              in the temple, without the approval of parents, family members or 
              friends, is now a thing of the past. There will continue to be difficulties, 
              as there are always difficulties in family relationships and in 
              conflicts of values and ambition; but significantly, ISKCON's recruitment 
              and educational models will not contradict norms of behaviour accepted 
              by the majority in German society. 
            <p> Missionary research and practice is now concentrating on ministry 
              and pastoral care of the Society's many lay members. Issues of care 
              for the sick and dying are becoming relevant as are the care for 
              the old and infirm. The need for health insurance and pension provision 
              are important considerations for many members, and ISKCON has undertaken 
              such developments for the good of the community. 
            <p> As ISKCON's community develops, it begins to look more like a 
              regular Vaisnava or Hindu community. The family institution is greatly 
              valued and respected in Hindu or Vedic tradition and so too in ISKCON. 
              The concerns of many parents of our first members have become the 
              concerns of many of our present members, who are themselves parents. 
              Thus, even though many of our German members do not have parents 
              or a family who share our faith, we have worked over the last five 
              years to increase and improve communication between family members 
              associated with our tradition. 
            <p> Devotees have attempted to facilitate the needs and concerns of 
              ISKCON members and their families through a magazine for parents 
              (Elternforum - Parents Forum) and regular nation-wide parents meetings. 
              In order to broaden the dialogue, speakers at such meetings include 
              non-ISKCON scholars and representatives of Christian churches. These 
              efforts are proving successful and are useful in developing understanding 
              and genuine respect among families. They also centre attention on 
              the need for good family relationships and on social concerns rather 
              than theological or cultural differences. 
            <p> ISKCON culture has changed to the extent that the position of 
              women is now an important and open issue. The question of equal 
              rights, (a question that is certainly not adequately answered in 
              German society as a whole) has naturally developed with both women 
              and men holding leading positions in administrative and spiritual 
              roles. In spite of the advancement ISKCON Germany has made in this 
              field, the age-old differences and difficulties recognised in communication 
              and behaviour between men and women, as found in all cultures and 
              religions, continue to baffle us, and I suspect they will always 
              do so.</p>
            <p> 
            <h5> <b>The Issue of 'Guruism' in ISKCON Germany</b></h5>
            <p>One of the main criticisms made of ISKCON in Germany is in relation 
              to the so-called 'guru-cult' or 'guruism'. The concept of guru is 
              important in Vaisnavism and Hinduism, and we feel it has been grossly 
              misrepresented and maligned over the last thirty years by representatives 
              of the media and the Christian churches. 
            <p> The particular analysis presented by the churches in Germany seems 
              to be unique to this country. In many cases it seems that church 
              members have looked at the guru concept solely in the light of their 
              own theological tradition, its values and social norms. These norms 
              and values do not serve well to understand Eastern cultures and 
              religions and are generally used to undermine them. In short, the 
              analysis is a Christian one and cannot be used to faithfully represent 
              the viewpoint of the Vaisnava or Hindu traditions. Thus this approach 
              excludes the possibility of an open and sincere dialogue. 
            <p> By propagation of a distorted image of the guru, as one who demands 
              absolute submission and who has total control over his followers, 
              a prejudice has developed which perpetuates stereotypes of Hare 
              Krsna devotees and members of many other Hindu groups as misguided 
              victims of dangerous sects. Followers of gurus are supposedly not 
              allowed to retain their discrimination or critical faculty. This 
              is a misconception that greatly inhibits dialogue. 
            <p> The misunderstanding has not only been one way. Some ISKCON members 
              have also adopted the impression that the guru is a messiah or an 
              oracle giving advice on each and every issue in the disciple's life. 
              There has been abuse of the guru-disciple relationship by many parties 
              and this area of philosophy and its application in ISKCON is in 
              need of careful examination and re-evaluation. However, this process 
              will not be successfully executed by interpretative religious encounter 
              or in the media. 
            <p> An important and definitive test of the guru's role, and of the 
              extent of his power over his disciples, came for ISKCON Germany 
              between June and September 1998. 
            <p> Harikesa Swami (aka Visnupada) had been the undisputed managerial 
              authority and spiritual leader in ISKCON Germany since the passing 
              of ISKCON's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in 1977. 
              Harikesa was the Governing Body Commissioner (GBC) for Germany and 
              for many years the only guru allowed to initiate in Germany. Most 
              of ISKCON Germany's second generation<a href="#4d">(4)</a><a name="4"></a> 
              were disciples of Harikesa. Harikesa's autocratic management style 
              had been criticised by ISKCON members outside of Germany for many 
              years, but within Germany it was seldom openly questioned. 
            <p> In June 1998, shortly after accepting the position of Chairman 
              of the international GBC, Harikesa began to manifest irrational 
              behaviour. Furthermore, he gave up his vows of celibacy (sannyasa) 
              and resigned from most of his official positions. Over the next 
              few months he began to disassociate himself from ISKCON, advocating 
              a philosophy that deviates from Vaisnava morality and values. Those 
              whose perception of guru is that of a dangerous manipulator would 
              expect that in such a situation the faithful disciples would either 
              follow their guru blindly or lose their faith and begin a painful 
              return to 'normal life'. 
            <p> In general, neither of these occurred. Most of Harikesa's disciples 
              rejected him and chose to stay with the teachings, principles and 
              values of ISKCON's founder. The test, unwelcome as it was, proved 
              the reality of the disciples' position to be one of individual choice 
              of values and lifestyle, not blind following and immorality. 
            <p> This case has significantly sped up the practical development 
              of the Wiesbaden principles. The lid has been lifted off the pot 
              and a more thoughtful and independent atmosphere has gained acceptance 
              within ISKCON Germany. Devotees are reassessing their own relationship 
              to the philosophy of Krsna consciousness and the relationship between 
              their personal needs and ISKCON the institution. The idea that disciples 
              are directed from above, without individual choice, by an all-powerful 
              and absolute guru figure has been seriously discredited. 
            <p> In an official media release, which was issued immediately after 
              the suspension of Harikesa by the international GBC, one disciple 
              said, 'The present situation is very sad. However, under these circumstances 
              I do not want to support my guru, as he is questioning the basic 
              teachings of the tradition.' 
            <p> This case invites serious study and strengthens the argument that 
              observers should engage in direct encounter with ISKCON rather than 
              interpretative encounter. The affair has also prompted more and 
              more of ISKCON's members to consider the social integration of Vaisnavism 
              into German society a high priority. Consequently, open discussion 
              and reassessment of social and philosophical issues have become 
              the norm among ISKCON's members.</p>
            <p> 
            <h5> <b>The German Government's Commission of Inquiry</b></h5>
            <p>The Commission of Inquiry (1995-1997) established by the German 
              Government was the most important test of ISKCON's resolve to implement 
              the Wiesbaden principles. 
            <p> The Commission's existence resulted in deep controversy and ultimately 
              great changes within the movement. For some within the management 
              of ISKCON Germany, the Commission represented a threat, to which 
              an aggressive response seemed most appropriate. Others felt that 
              the old paradigms and responses, which bordered on extremism and 
              which had been rejected at Wiesbaden, should be replaced with the 
              risk of dialogue. 
            <p> For instance, when ISKCON was invited to present itself before 
              a hearing in the Bundestag, there was a debate within ISKCON's German 
              National Council about who should represent ISKCON or even if we 
              should go there at all. While some took the view that the entire 
              Commission of Inquiry should be rejected as prejudiced because of 
              having representatives of the Christian churches as members, others 
              perceived a real opportunity to develop a discourse with society. 
            <p> The latter course was chosen by the German National Council. It 
              was a risk because it was uncharted water and there were few guidelines, 
              except for the principle of open two-way communication and dialogue 
              to which the NC committed itself in 1994. 
            <p> The question of choosing ISKCON's representatives to the Commission 
              proved interesting. If they were to represent the reality of ISKCON 
              in Germany then they must represent the householders, who make up 
              96% of its membership and at least one woman (women comprising about 
              half the membership). 
            <p> This kind of representation was a marked departure from the previous 
              culture of ISKCON which dictated that a hierarchy of spiritual status, 
              institutional seniority and maleness should decide the issue. 
            <p> It was decided that my colleague from Berlin, Harivallabha Dasi, 
              a wife, a mother and the current Secretary of ISKCON Germany; Parivadi 
              Dasa, a married man and a member of the Communications team; and 
              myself should go to the hearing. These choices proved successful 
              and the dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry continued during 
              the entire period of the Commission. Speaking personally, I found 
              that the opportunity to develop a real dialogue and to respond frankly 
              to frank questions was a great relief. I was pleased to be able 
              to present the facts, objectively and without prejudice. 
            <p> In short, the Commission provided ISKCON with an important opportunity 
              to implement its Wiesbaden principles; an opportunity that ISKCON 
              took to heart and committed itself to. 
            <p> The effect of the Commission's final report may be less exciting. 
              Significantly, the issue of biased propaganda against religious 
              minorities was not sufficiently addressed or restricted by the Commission 
              and continues to produce prejudice and anxiety. The rift between 
              academic analysis of such minorities on one side and the continuation 
              of the anti-cult-propaganda on the other side is still wide. There 
              are no practical plans on the Commission's part to develop a dialogue 
              or an exchange of information. 
            <h5> <b>Conclusion</b></h5>
            <p>ISKCON in Germany is learning from its past - from its successes 
              and its mistakes. Senior members of the institution's management 
              team are listening to critical feedback, from inside and outside 
              the movement, and sincerely trying to address the issues raised. 
              Internal problems are discussed in public forums, and there is greater 
              access for members to influence executive decisions. 
            <p> The willingness to discuss publicly difficult problems is even 
              greater on the international level, especially in England and the 
              USA. Recently the <i>ISKCON Communications Journal </i>published 
              an article on past child abuse in ISKCON-run schools in the USA 
              and India. The authors of this article were a scholar and his researcher, 
              neither of whom were ISKCON devotees. 
            <p> Not even declared anti-cult parties had published as many facts 
              on this issue. Therefore, we are moving into a situation where ISKCON 
              is becoming a reliable, primary source of objective information 
              about itself. It is currently providing more information, both positive 
              and negative, about itself than the cult action groups. 
            <p> These developments are strategic and vital if ISKCON is to survive 
              into its next thirty years, if even its own membership is to continue 
              taking it seriously. Internally, dialogue and a self-critical approach 
              have become the rule in ISKCON Germany. Thus the step to participate 
              in genuine dialogue outside of ISKCON has become much easier and 
              more rewarding for its members. 
            <p> Almost all of ISKCON Germany's management is staffed by second 
              generation members. The guru and sannyasa disciples of Srila Prabhupada, 
              ISKCON's founder, are withdrawing from these positions, and it is 
              expected that in the future they will be responsible only for their 
              individual missionary projects. This is a significant development, 
              as the second generation's perspective on social integration differs 
              greatly from that of the first generation. For instance, the push 
              for the Wiesbaden conference and the initiatives for dialogue with 
              scholars and church representatives came from second generation 
              members. 
            <p> The greatest need now, if ISKCON is to realise its capacity for 
              further integration, is for a better exchange of information and 
              further examination and research. Anxiety arises mainly from ignorance. 
              If we can establish forums for dialogue, mediation, study or round- 
              table discussion, with all interest groups represented, the communication 
              necessary to alleviate hostility and ignorance can begin to take 
              place. For this to happen, ISKCON must look for help to its partner 
              in dialogue, German society. 
            <p> Is German society presently willing and capable of receiving ISKCON? 
              ISKCON will remain an outsider until individual scholars, churchmen 
              and politicians open the door. This will take great moral courage, 
              a courage that is already beginning to be shown by various representatives 
              of society. We are depending on the help and reciprocation of society 
              in general, so that ISKCON can take its place in the German Republic 
              and make a positive social contribution. </p>
