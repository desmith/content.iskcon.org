                    <p>Rarely has anyone so eloquently described ISKCON's past 

                      history and present need for historical self-reflection 

                      as Dr Thomas J. Hopkins in his article 'Why ISKCON Should 

                      Study Its Own History'. An earnest admirer of Srila Prabhupada, 

                      a genuine friend of ISKCON from its beginning, and a scholar 

                      widely honoured for his broad, lucid thinking, Dr Hopkins 

                      here makes a profound and extraordinarily perceptive appeal 

                      to ISKCON to record, comprehend and express historiographically 

                      these crucial early days of a spiritual movement.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>As Dr Hopkins notes, 'ISKCON is now in a position to undertake 

                      such an effort and needs to do so while Prabhupada's influence 

                      is still so powerful in living memory'. Dr Hopkins proceeds 

                      to demonstrate how three major religions - Buddhism, Christianity 

                      and Islam - made serious, contemporary efforts to preserve 

                      their early traditions, thus creating the possibility of 

                      critically assessing, at any given point in history, the 

                      extent to which they had stayed on, or strayed from, their 

                      original path and mandate.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>Historically, the Vaisnava tradition has distinguished 

                      itself by its vast erudition and brilliant self-expression. 

                      Dr Gary Tubb, then chairman of the Sanskrit and Indian Studies 

                      Department at Harvard, once expressed to me at length his 

                      deep admiration for Rupa Go­swami, who had emerged as a 

                      towering intellectual figure in his time through his application 

                      of 'Rasa Theory' to the pastimes of Lord Krsna in such works 

                      as <i>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu.</i> Among our forefathers 

                      are such lettered figures as Vyasadeva himself, Jiva Goswami, 

                      Ramanuja, Madhva, Baladeva Vidyabhusana, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, 

                      Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura and of course Srila Prabhupada, 

                      who earned so much heartfelt acclaim from the international 

                      academic community.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>ISKCON desperately needs to develop the ability to think 

                      intelligently, critically and historically about itself. 

                      When problems arise, we need to know that these same problems 

                      have manifested many times in the past, both within Vaisnava 

                      history and in the history of other traditions. We need 

                      to know what solutions worked and why, and which attempted 

                      solutions made matters worse and why. ISKCON devotees in 

                      the future will need to know how ISKCON developed, what 

                      really happened, what the problems were, how they were solved 

                      or not solved, and thousands of other issues that will empower 

                      them to serve as wise, experienced stewards of Srila Prabhupada's 

                      movement. It is our grave duty to bequeath to future members 

                      of ISKCON this invaluable resource which only we can provide. 

                      If we don't preserve the history of these days, much of 

                      it will be lost forever.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>Most impressively, Dr Hopkins argues that ISKCON should 

                      write its own history: 'This is not a job to leave to outsiders, 

                      although they may provide scholarly advice; it is a family 

                      job, to be done by devotees trained for the task, and conscious 

                      of the movement's needs as well as the obligations of scholarship. 

                      ISKCON's history over the past three decades must be studied 

                      with constant reference to what it could be, and should 

                      be, on the basis of Prabhu­pada's fundamental principles, 

                      so that strengths can be recognised and built upon, and 

                      mis­takes can be corrected before they cause future harm.'<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>At the same time, Dr Hopkins reminds us that the competent 

                      writing of history requires disciplined training and institutional 

                      support: 'This task awaits devotees who have the his­­to­rical 

                      training and the institutional support to carry out what 

                      will be even at this early stage of ISKCON's development 

                      a difficult and time-consuming job of collecting the world-wide 

                      data of ISKCON's expansion and evolution, organising it 

                      systematically and trying for the first time to provide 

                      a comprehensive understanding of ISKCON's history.'<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p>Once Srila Prabhupada had established his movement in India, 

                      he constantly con­sulted with educated friends and well-wishers 

                      regarding the welfare of his society. There can be no question 

                      that Dr Thomas Hopkins has proven himself to be an unusually 

                      sup­por­tive and learned friend of ISKCON from its inception. 

                      We must have the maturity to recog­nise the wisdom of his 

                      words, and, as Srila Prabhupada often said, we must 'do 

                      the needful'.<o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>
