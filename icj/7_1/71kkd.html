                    Ksetra Dasa</a> </h2>

                  <p class=Purport><i> This paper by Krsna Ksetra Dasa, looks 

                    at a landmark in the life of Bhaktivinoda Thakura - his acceptance 

                    of the Bhagavata Purana (Srimad-Bhagavatam) as a theistic 

                    work, equal to the philosophy of the West and important to 

                    mankind as a whole. Bhaktivinoda Thakura (1838-1914) is recognised 

                    as a prominent acarya in the Gaudiya-Vaisnava tradition. He 

                    lived during a crucial period in Indian history, a time when 

                    Indian culture began to rediscover itself and react to the 

                    British-Christian hegemony. Bhaktivinoda expressed his appreciation 

                    of Srimad-Bhagavatam in his pamphlet: The Bhagavata: Its Philosophy, 

                    Its Ethics, and Its Theology. Krsna Ksetra examines the theological 

                    points made by Bhaktivinoda in his pamphlet, giving specific 

                    attention to the time and circumstances in which they were 

                    voiced. He places the pamphlet in the historical context of 

                    Christian missionary fervour versus Hindu revivalism and notes 

                    Bhaktivinoda's efforts to bridge the gap between these two 

                    opposing factions.<o:p></o:p> </i></p>

                  <p class=Purport> Amid the manifold transformations constituting 

                    the 'Bengal Renaissance' of the nineteenth century, an important 

                    issue was how to deal with sacred texts. Throughout the nineteenth 

                    century, intellectuals in Bengal were particularly put to 

                    task to determine how indigenous sacred literature was to 

                    be valued, and how it was to be understood and applied in 

                    the context of social and religious reform - bywords of the 

                    emerging British-schooled indigenous intelligentsia. The official 

                    opening of India to Christian missionaries in 1813 by the 

                    British East India Company accelerated the proliferation of 

                    the Bible, (soon translated into several Indian vernacular 

                    languages <a name="1"></a>(<a href="#1d">1</a>)&nbsp; and 

                    distributed widely throughout India) along with strong claims 

                    of its superiority to the scriptures of the 'Hindoos.' At 

                    the same time, there was an awakening concern amongst educated 

                    Indians about the need to examine their own traditional scriptures, 

                    which were in turn receiving considerable attention by Western 

                    (initially German) scholars. <a name="2"></a>(<a href="#2d">2</a>)&nbsp; 

                  </p>

                  <p class=purppara> Western attention to Indian scriptures grew 

                    out of mixed motives: genuine appreciation and fascination 

                    with the exotic, which predominated in the late eighteenth 

                    and early nineteenth centuries, gave way in the late nineteenth 

                    century to a practical concern to comprehend them and an intention 

                    to demonstrate the supposed superiority of Christian scripture. 

                    The net effect of this attention by European scholars was 

                    to cause renewed consideration of classical writings in a 

                    new context. </p>

                  <p class=purppara> The presence of scriptures in opposition 

                    to classical Hindu scriptures - the ancient <i>Vedas </i>and 

                    related Sanskrit works such as the <i>Upanisads </i>and <i>Puranas</i> 

                    - was not new to India. Jaina, Buddhist, and Islamic scriptural 

                    texts were a growing presence over the centuries. What <i>was 

                    </i>new was the printing press. Christian missionaries were 

                    quick to use the printing press to expand their influence 

                    through the publication of pamphlets and Bibles in Indian 

                    vernacular languages. It became imperative for Hindu intellectuals 

                    to ponder the implications of the claimed superiority of Christian 

                    scripture and the shortcomings of Hindu texts. </p>

                  <p class=purppara> In this paper I will explore this reflection 

                    on scripture in India through the lens of one indigenous Indian 

                    scholar and religionist, Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda. Bhaktivinoda 

                    was an important leader and <i>acarya</i> of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas 

                    of Bengal in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 

                    <a name="3"></a>(<a href="#3d">3)</a>&nbsp; </p>

                  <p class=purppara> As a family man employed in a variety of 

                    responsible civil service posts, Bhaktivinoda was professionally 

                    and educationally well acquainted with the intellectual currents 

                    swirling through India, and especially through Bengal. In 

                    later years Bhaktivinoda, a prolific writer, would expound 

                    extensively on Gaudiya Vaisnava theology and culture, basing 

                    his own work on earlier writings of the same school, centering 

                    on its late fifteenth and early sixteenth century founder, 

                    Sri Caitanya. But these writings came after a sea-change in 

                    his thinking, (<a href="#4d">4</a>)<a name="4"></a>&nbsp; 

                    marked by a public speech (in English) in 1869 later published 

                    as a pamphlet, <i>The Bhagavata: Its Philosophy, Its Ethics, 

                    and Its Theology</i>. Bhaktivinoda was thirty-one years old 

                    at the time and had recently secured a position as Deputy 

                    Magistrate in the Bengal district of Dinajpur, north of Calcutta. 

                  </p>

                  <p class=purppara> The focus of this article will be on this 

                    particular work, for it marks the beginning of a new type 

                    of self-awareness among followers of the Gaudiya-Vaisnava 

                    tradition, and because it highlights the contrast between 

                    Bhaktivinoda's early thinking and Hindu or neo-Hindu reformist 

                    responses to Western presence in India. As we shall see, Bhaktivinoda 

                    represents a return to Indian spiritual tradition, but he 

                    does not represent a reactionary rejection of progress. Rather, 

                    by helping his countrymen and women take a fresh look at one 

                    important traditional sacred text, the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>, 

                    Bhaktivinoda calls attention to the tradition's built-in reformist 

                    element. As a Hindu reformer, Bhaktivinoda demonstrated tremendous 

                    creativity by recasting, in the light of contemporary concerns, 

                    an earlier reform movement - the Krsna-bhakti movement of 

                    Sri Caitanya, who based his teachings on the <i>Bhagavata 

                    Purana</i> (hereafter, <i>Bhagavatam</i>). Thus Bhaktivinoda 

                    drew a path of spirituality from the Vedic literature to what 

                    he identified as the apex of Vedic tradition, the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, 

                    as a viable means to spirituality in an India entering the 

                    modern world. </p>

                  <p class=purppara> I make use of the typology of nineteenth 

                    century encounter between Christianity and Hinduism in Bengal 

                    offered by Ronald Neufeldt to locate Bhaktivinoda in relation 

                    to the variety of identifiable trends of the time. Like some 

                    Hindu reformers, Bhaktivinoda's response was thoroughly and 

                    unapologetically theistic; unlike others, he refused to subordinate 

                    <i>bhakti </i>- devotion to a divinity - to non-dual experience 

                    of advaitic leanings. Like both, he is aware of and participates 

                    in discourse on religious pluralism. Like all reformers, he 

                    responds to the challenges of the Christian missionaries and 

                    the attentions of the Western Indologists. As we shall see, 

                    his response is simple yet confident - that with the proper 

                    acceptance of the <i>Bhagavatam </i>as taught by and exemplified 

                    in the life of Sri Caitanya, the sixteenth century Bengali 

                    propounder of <i>bhakti</i>, nothing would be left wanting 

                    for seekers of ultimate knowledge and transcendental enlightenment.

                    gives an assessment of the learning he had gathered in earlier 

                    years, and the sense of distaste he had developed for the

                      lots of Vaishnav works. Greedily we poured over the various

                  <p class=Purport> Bhaktivinoda outlines his early education 

                    in a short autobiographical work <i>Sva-Likhita Jivani</i> 

                    ('Autobiography', hereafter referenced as SLJ) which he wrote 

                    in 1896 for his son Lalita Prasad Datta. At age fourteen, 

                    Bhaktivinoda recalls having talked with English military men, 

                    and that he would visit Christian missionaries whenever they 

                    came to town. His maternal uncle was the recognised Bengali 

                    poet Kashi Prasad Ghosh, who would test his ability to read 

                    and write. He recalls having 'limitless faith' in Isvara Chandra 

                    Nandi, who taught him literature (both English and Indian) 

                    at the Hindu Charitable Institution. Isvara was 'truthful, 

                    controlled his senses, was religious, knowledgeable in all 

                    the <i>sastras </i>and was well spoken.' Having studied four 

                    years there, Bhaktivinoda was able to write in English for 

                    the <i>Hindu Intelligencer </i>and give lectures in English 

                    as well as to exercise debating talent at 'societies like 

                    the Free Debating Club'. (<i>SLJ,</i> para 101-120) </p>

                  <p class=purppara> Bhaktivinoda's youthful enthusiasm and learning 

                    gave him considerable confidence, reflecting on which he would 

                    later write in his autobiography, 'On the strength of my little 

                    learning I thought that no one [but me] had any knowledge.' 

                    In Calcutta he studied several English books on philosophy, 

                    from the library of Kashi Prasad Ghosh. In the year 1856, 

                    at age eighteen, Bhaktivinoda entered Hindu School in Calcutta, 

                    where he had such schoolmates as Satyendranath Tagore (<a href="#6d">6</a><a name="6"></a>)&nbsp; 

                    and Keshub Chandra Sen who was a year ahead of Bhaktivinoda. 

                    (<a href="#7d">7</a><a name="7"></a>)&nbsp; Not able to enter 

                    the university (due to illness preventing him from taking 

                    the entrance examination), Bhaktivinoda resorted to self-education. 

                    Among authors he recalls having read were Edison, Carlisle, 

                    Haslett, Jeffrey, Macaulay, and Milton.' Every day I would 

                    go to Metcalf Hall and read books.' He often shared his gathered 

                    knowledge, giving 'lectures at many <i>sabhas</i>' (<i>SLJ,</i> 

                    para 131). Significantly, he also met and discussed with Charles 

                    H.A. Dall, the Unitarian minister who had arrived a year before 

                    in Calcutta (Kopf, 1979, p. 15). (<a href="#8d">8</a><a name="8"></a>)&nbsp; 

                    In that same year Bhaktivinoda wrote <i>Poriade</i>, a two-part 

                    poetic 'epic' which was, he tells us, liked by Reverend Duff, 

                    (<a href="#9d">9</a><a name="9"></a>)&nbsp; who urged him 

                    to write in the same fashion 'about the cruelty of the Zamindars,' 

                    a suggestion which Bhaktivinoda rejected. (<i>SLJ,</i> para 

                    133) </p>

                  <p class=purppara> After considerable exposure to Western ideas 

                    in the course of schooling, Bhaktivinoda would eventually 

                    enter into the midst of British-Indian interaction through 

                    the British governmental civil service. After serving in several 

                    positions in various towns in Bengal, he was posted as deputy 

                    magistrate in Dinajpur in March 1868 where, inspired by the 

                    presence of many Vaisnavas, he acquired a copy of the sixteenth 

                    century biography of Sri Caitanya, <i>Sri-Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, 

                    and a Bengali translation of the <i>Bhagavatam</i> (Rupavilasa 

                    Dasa, 82). This would mark a significant turning point in 

                    his life. Whereas his 'prejudices gathered in unripe years' 

                    may have included sympathies with the Brahmosamaj, in Dinajpur 

                    he declared himself definitely separate from it in 1869. (<a href="#10d">10</a><a name="10"></a>)&nbsp; 

                    He noted in his autobiography (written in 1896): &nbsp; </p>

                      The schoolmasters were Brahmos but almost everyone else 

                      was Hindu. The Hindus were endeavoring to put the Brahmos 

                      out of their caste. At that time the Brahmos invited me 

                      to come to their assembly and I wrote to them saying that 

                      I was not a Brahmo, but was a servant of the many followers 

                      of Caitanya. When the Brahmos heard this they gave up hope 

                      of my [becoming a Brahmo]. The Hindus invited me to form 

                      a <i>sabha </i>[for Hindus] and the first meeting was held 

                      in the house of Khajanji Babu. I gave a lecture on the <i>Bhagavata 

                      </i>which was published as a book. A few <i>sahibs </i>heard

                  <p class=Purport><i> The Bhagavata </i> is essentially an apologetic 

                    work addressed to educated Hindus, but also to sympathisers 

                    of Brahmoism as well as to European Christians who might have 

                    sympathies for Hindu reform movements. Originally a public 

                    speech, it contains eloquent and sometimes charming rhetoric, 

                    appealing to members of his audience to approach the <i>Bhagavatam

                    of prejudices and party spirit,' who is 'of the same disposition 

                    of mind as that of the author whose merits he is required 

                    to judge.' Such a thoughtful reader or true critic 'advises 

                    us to preserve what we have already obtained, and to adjust 

                    our race from that point where we have arrived in the heat 

                    of our progress.' He is not a destroyer of bad ideas, but 

                    rather one able to improve bad or old ideas for present purposes:

                    critique of Christians against the Vaisnava tradition: 'Thus 

                    it is that a great deal of ungenerousness enters into the 

                    arguments of the pious Christians when they pass their imperfect

                    p. 7). </p>

                  <p class=purppara> As Ronald Neufeldt points out, Christian 

                    missionary presence in India, as much as the Hindu Renaissance 

                    response to it, was not a monolithic entity but a fluid situation 

                    with a variety of approaches to their conceived task of conversion. 

                    That said, it is also clear that an attitude prevailed among 

                    the missionaries that there was nothing to be learned from 

                    the Hindus nor from their texts; rather, the exclusive way 

                    of salvation through Jesus was to be demonstrated by showing 

                    the inerrancy of Christian scripture, and Hindu scripture 

                    was to be - if attended to at all - shown for its folly (Neufeldt, 

                    pp. 29-30). Whatever attention was paid to the textual traditions 

                    was, Neufeldt notes, 'to show that the observed corruption 

                    [of Hindu society] has a basis in the historical and textual 

                    traditions of India' (Neufeldt, p. 31). </p>

                  <p class=purppara> As Hindu reform manifested in response to 

                    Christian preaching, Christian missionaries made a shift in 

                    strategy. Instead of aiming to seek converts directly from 

                    followers of 'popular Hinduism' the missions put their preaching 

                    energies into challenging reformed Hinduism or 'Vedantism.' 

                    Hindu orthodoxy as represented by village priests was more 

                    or less impervious to direct criticism by Christians, for 

                    amongst other reasons, there were linguistic barriers (see 

                    Kopf, 1979, pp. 160-61). It would have to be approached, so 

                    it was thought, through the liberal Hindu intelligentsia - 

                    especially that which made up the growing Brahmosamaj (the 

                    Vedantists, as they were known in the 1830s) and which, like 

                    Christian missionaries, was dedicated to reform. After flirtations 

                    with the Bible, Rammohun Roy and his followers had found scriptural 

                    value in the <i>Upanisads </i>and <i>Vedanta </i>as revealed 

                    sources of truth, as proof of Indian monotheism, as a basis 

                    of doctrinal guidance and inspiration, and as anchorage against 

                    both Christian missionaries and Hindu orthodox superstition. 

                    Whereas early Christian polemic was directed against the 'idolatry' 

                    perpetuated by Hindu orthodox priests, the new polemic would 

                    be directed against 'the God of the <i>Vedant</i>,' following 

                    the example of Kailas Chandra Mukherji, a convert of the influential 

                    Scottish preacher, Alexander Duff. Bannerji wrote in 1833:

                  <p class=Purport> Bhaktivinoda felt that although Roy's search 

                    for truth was commendable, and although he was not incorrect 

                    in ascertaining that universal truth could be imbibed from 

                    the 'Western Saviour' (Jesus Christ), he established the Brahmosamaj 

                    'independently of what was in his own country in the Beautiful 

                    <i>Bhagavat,</i>' thus denying himself the benefits of the 

                    text most valued by the 'Eastern Saviour,' Sri Caitanya of 

                    Nadia (<i>The Bhagavata</i>, pp. 4-6). Bhaktivinoda contrasts 

                    himself with Roy in that, although similarly seeking truth 

                    and finding inspiration 'in a manner Unitarian' in belief, 

                    he found writings about the 'Mighty Genius of Nadia,' perhaps 

                    in answer to prayer 'as Jesus prayed in the Garden', from 

                    which he was led to discover the <i>Bhagavatam </i>(<i>The 

                    Bhagavata</i>, p. 6). Through the teachings of Sri Caitanya 

                    it would be possible to access the theistic indigenous tradition 

                    which was yet situated in lofty philosophy, not in superstitious 

                    idolatry - a tradition which itself was one of reform. </p>

                  <p class=purppara> Neufeldt notes that reform was not new to 

                    Indian religion, but that the nineteenth century brought a 

                    new focus on Hinduism. &nbsp; </p>

                    <p> If one analyses the usual figures associated with the 

                      Hindu Renaissance, one is immediately struck by an overarching 

                      concern, that is, the concern to reform, refine and define 

                      Hinduism. The concern for reform is, of course, not new, 

                      but runs through Indian history as far back as the <i>Upanisads</i>. 

                      What is new is the focus on Hinduism. This is largely a 

                      concept forced onto India from the outside, at least in 

                      its use to define religion. And, once it became current, 

                      the spokespersons for the Renaissance began to argue and 

                      think in terms of Hinduism. (Neufeldt, p. 37) &nbsp; </p>

                    Sri Caitanya, could therefore act to resolve the ongoing wranglings

                      of faith which requires an exalted soul to understand. It 

                      certainly requires previous training of the soul in the

                    evils'. Bhaktivinoda concludes his point with a reference 

                    to the European Christian reformer: 'Luthers, instead of critics, 

                    are what we want for the correction of those evils by the 

                    true interpretation of the original precepts' (<i>The Bhagavata</i>,

                    obstacle was the presence of apparent <i>elements of non-rationality</i>: 

                    Readers of the <i>Bhagavatam </i>schooled in the modern mode 

                    of rational thinking might become dismayed by the presence 

                    of apparently irrational descriptions therein. Graphic descriptions 

                    of heavens and hells meant to 'check the evil deeds of ignorant 

                    people who are not able to understand the conclusions of philosophy' 

                    are found both in 'commonplace books of the Hindu religion' 

                    as well as in the <i>Bhagavatam</i>. However, Bhaktivinoda 

                    warns his readers elsewhere in the work 'not to accept them 

                    as real facts, but as inventions to overawe the wicked and 

                    improve the simple and ignorant.' He assures his audience 

                    that the philosophical principle behind these descriptions

                  <p class=Purport> Indeed, this was Bhaktivinoda's experience 

                    not long before delivering this speech. Having thought on 

                    first reading in <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i> that Caitanya 

                    recommends the worship of 'the improper character of Krsna,' 

                    Bhaktivinoda recalls that he prayed, 'O God! please give me 

                    the understanding by which I may know the secret of this matter.' 

                    Shortly thereafter his prayer was answered: 'The mercy of 

                    God is without limit. Seeing my eagerness and humility He 

                    showed mercy to me within a few days, and I received the intelligence 

                    by which I could understand' (<i>SVJ,</i> para 245). (<a href="#17d">17</a><a name="17"></a>)&nbsp; 

                  </p>

                  <p class=purppara> Thus Bhaktivinoda does not deny the existence 

                    of obstacles in approaching the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, but they 

                    are not insurmountable obstacles, and the reward for the effort 

                    is such as to secure for its reader the possibility of becoming 

                    a <i>saragrahi</i>, a 'seizer of the essence.' To do so requires 

                    a process of selective thought: &nbsp; </p>

                <div class=Section1> 

                  <p class=Purport> From such statements it might seem that Bhaktivinoda 

                    is proposing a new, modern way of reading scripture. Whereas 

                    the traditional prescription has always been to read (or, 

                    more often, to hear) scripture in an attitude of unquestioning 

                    submission, such an attitude does not preclude the necessity 

                    to read critically while taking guidance from previous commentators 

                    to the work. For such critical reflection Bhaktivinoda presents 

                    Vyasa as the prime example. His mature realisation consists 

                    of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, composed after distancing himself 

                    from works he had himself previously compiled. Hence, for 

                    Bhaktivinoda, Vyasa is proof that the modern<b> </b>way of 

                    reading <i>sastra </i>is in fact not new at all, and the fact 

                    that Sri Caitanya, the 'Eastern Saviour,' exemplified and 

                    taught that the <i>Bhagavatam </i>is proof that Indians need 

                    not resort to scriptures from outside India as sources of 

                    revealed knowledge. &nbsp; </p>

                  <h5 class=Subhead2><i> <b>The Bhagavata</b> </i><b> in Context 

                    </b> &nbsp; </h5>

                  <p class=Purport> Response to Bhaktivinoda's 1869 speech in 

                    Dinajpur was positive, if mild. Bhaktivinoda notes simply, 

                    'A few sahibs heard the lecture and were impressed' (<i>SVJ,</i> 

                    para. 247). In contrast, when in 1819 Ram Mohan Roy published 

                    his pamphlet <i>The Precepts of Jesus, the Guide to Peace 

                    and Happiness</i>, there was strong negative reaction both 

                    from Christians and Hindus. Roy's conciliatory intent between 

                    Christianity and Hinduism was met with accusations from both 

                    sides (Klostermaier, 389). Bhaktivinoda's intent, fifty years 

                    later, was similarly conciliatory but arguably rooted more 

                    firmly in his own tradition. Perhaps the time factor, but 

                    perhaps also the method of approach, brought the milder reaction. 

                  </p>

                  <p class=purppara> Clearly Bhaktivinoda was intent on calling 

                    attention to the <i>Bhagavatam </i>as theistic revelatory 

                    scripture in answer both to Christian claims that Indian scripture 

                    was not monotheistic, and to Brahmo preoccupations with its 

                    own version of <i>Vedanta</i>. Less explicitly, but nevertheless 

                    significantly, there exists in Bhaktivinoda's <i>Bhagavatam</i> 

                    eulogy a response to the Western Indologist fascination with 

                    Indian sacred texts. Since the writings of Max Mueller, there 

                    had prevailed the notion that true Indian culture was to be 

                    found in the ancient literature - especially the <i>Rg Veda 

                    </i>and the <i>Upanisads </i>- as well as in the writings 

                    on <i>Vedanta </i>and Sankhya. The <i>Puranas</i>, so it was 

                    thought, represented accretions which reflected and perpetuated 

                    the practices and beliefs of <i>popular </i>Hinduism - the 

                    body of religious institutions most distant from progressive 

                    human thinking and most unresponsive to the removal of social 

                    ills. Bhaktivinoda resisted this simple formula by acknowledging 

                    the value of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, one of the eighteen <i>Mahapuranas</i>, 

                    or principle <i>Puranas</i>. At the same time, like the Indologists, 

                    Bhaktivinoda put a premium on philosophy over narrative and 

                    particulars of belief. However, by comparing 'foreigners' 

                    to the proverbial blind men seeking to comprehend an elephant, 

                    Bhaktivinoda was in all probability alluding to the Western 

                    scholars who, because of their general prejudice against the 

                    <i>Puranas</i>, would be expected to miss the philosophical 

                    profundity of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>. Unlike the majority of 

                    Hindu reformers, Bhaktivinoda showed little inclination to 

                    grant the term 'Hinduism' the status being imposed by Europeans<b>, 

                    </b>for whom the term provided a handy suggestion of an essential 

                    common denominator amid the multiplicity of religious texts, 

                    beliefs, and practices of the Indian subcontinent. Whereas 

                    the Indian (especially Bengali) reformers were concerned to 

                    recover 'Hinduism' from its reputation for religious backwardness, 

                    Bhaktivinoda offered a different typology by universalising 

                    the term 'Vaisnava,' as the <i>saragrahi</i>, and placing 

                    persons of all religious or non-religious temperaments on 

                    a sliding scale of greater or lesser proximity to the standard 

                    of a spiritually perfected Vaisnava. In this way he turned 

                    the table on what Neufeldt terms the minority, more sympathetic 

                    'fulfillment' attitude among Christians such as J.N. Farquhar:

                  <p class=Purport> Bhaktivinoda similarly wanted to move away 

                    from the argument of inerrancy when he observed that 'Our 

                    <i>Shastras</i>, or in other words, books of thought, do not 

                    contain all that we could get from the infinite Father. No 

                    book is without its errors.' He wanted to offer Sri Caitanya, 

                    'our Eastern Saviour,' as an equal contender to Jesus, the 

                    'Western Saviour', as a fulfiller of human needs, together

                    Vyasa, the 'principal of the College of Theology at Badrikashrama'. 

                    Somewhat like Farquhar, Bhaktivinoda seems to place Indian 

                    sacred literature on a continuum of spiritual value measured 

                    on the ideal of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, such that other texts 

                    found spiritually wanting deserve recognition as necessary 

                    supporters of inferior <i>naimittika-dharma</i>, or regulated

                  <p class=purppara> Through the force of secularism generated 

                    by Enlightenment thinking, theological reflection in the West 

                    was undergoing radical changes even as missionary efforts 

                    in India roused indigenous thinkers to formulate their own 

                    clear and systematic religious concepts with scriptural grounding. 

                    Such reflection had been pursued for centuries within a relatively 

                    insular scriptural field, but with European presence and its 

                    accompanying print culture, Indian intelligentsia (which emerged 

                    largely in response to that same print culture) felt compelled 

                    to respond to this presence - either by rejecting it altogether 

                    or in some way accommodating it. The overconfidence of many 

                    (mainly Protestant) Christian missionaries to win India to 

                    Christianity and modern civilisation veiled perhaps a deeper 

                    uncertainty about the validity of their scripture in the face 

                    of modernism as it was taking shape in nineteenth century 

                    Europe. Bhaktivinoda's 1869 speech on 'The Bhagavata, Its 

                    Philosophy, Its Ethics and Its Theology' shows the beginnings 

                    of an increasing confidence in Indian religious scripture, 

                    wherein one can sense his awareness of Western uncertainty 

                    through his intellectual encounters in his student days. </p>

                  <p class=purppara> In later years, Bhaktivinoda made at least 

                    two gestures of assistance to the West by offering something 

                    of the teachings of the East. In 1880 he sent a copy of his 

                    Sanskrit work <i>Sri Krsna-samhita</i> to Ralph Waldo Emerson

                    signals of a single person working on his own, without any 

                    structured organisational entity to back him up. There was 

                    no 'pivotal social unit' (Malinowski) (Kopf, EE 35) to propel 

                    Bhaktivinoda's vision particularly far in India, what to speak 

                    of the West. But whereas history has thus far seemed to sidestep 

                    the work and writings of Bhaktivinoda, this may not be the 

                    enduring case. Gerald Larson has noted that the 'solution 

                    of synthesis' which has been considered by some writers the 

                    'successful response'(<a name="20"></a><a href="#20d">20</a>) 

                    to the coming of modernity in India, has over time proved 

                    to be the solution of a tiny percentage of the Indian populace. 

                  </p>

                  <p class=purppara> In Bhaktivinoda's time, in the height of 

                    British hegemony in India, he saw in the tra-dition of Caitanya 

                    not a sectarian 'Hindu' solution to modernity, but a tradition 

                    of reform which could be built upon to match the challenge 

                    of the West with a theologically sound, if misunderstood and 

                    neglected, text from the Indian scriptural corpus of revelatory 

                    truth. Bhaktivinoda sought to revive and continue that tradition 

                    of enlightened reform exemplified by Caitanya, whose message 

                    of <i>bhakti</i> to Krsna challenged caste barriers and brought 

                    the <i>Bhagavatam </i>forward as the 'ripened fruit of the 

                    tree of Vedic knowledge'.(<a href="#21d">21</a><a name="21"></a>)

                    later book <i>Prema Pradipa </i>(1886), in which he describes 

                    two young followers of Brahmosamaj, Naren Babu and Anand Babu, 

                    coming to Navadvipa from Calcutta in hopes of converting the 

                    local Vaisnavas to Brahmoism (<i>Prema Pradipa</i>, 11). In 

                    the course of the story (primarily in the form of dialogues, 

                    as in his book <i>Jaiva Dharma, </i>1893), the Brahmos become 

                    converted to Vaisnavism, having become attracted to the character 

                    of the Vaisnavas as well as their philosophy. Bhaktivinoda 

                    seems to suggest that he had leanings toward Brahmoism prior 

                    to his arrival in Dinajpur and his subsequent association 

                    with the Vaisnava community there. 'In Dinajpur the Vaisnava 

                    religion was fairly strong due to Raya Kamalochan Sahib. There 

                    were many Vairagis and Gosais coming and going there. A number 

                    of rich people supported many <i>brahmana-pandita</i> assemblies. 

                    Some respectable gentlemen would regularly come to me and 

                    discuss Vaisnava <i>dharma</i>. I had a desire to know the

                    Bhaktivinoda's comments here which faction of the recently 

                    split Brahmosamaj was represented at Dinajpur. It may be that 

                    it consisted of the more conservative group headed by Debendranath, 

                    not that led by Keshub Chandra Sen (Kopf, 1979, 132-36). </p>

                    to rescue Vaisnavism from the bad reputation it had received 

                    at the hands of unscrupulous persons. Careful reading of the

                    the means of recovering respectability for the Vaisnava faith. 

                    Such careful reading would distance one from what must have

                    Keshub Chandra Sen to establish a theological school in order 

                    to give 'durable structure' to the faith of the Brahmosamaj,

                    has been proposed as India's 'successful response' to the 

                    coming of modernity by Percival Spear: '[The] attempt to synthesise 

                    traditional Indian thought ... with modern Western thought 

                    ... as represented primarily in the work of Rammohun Roy ... 

                    is the 'ideological secret of modern India.' (Larson, 122). 

                    Other responses included an early 'military response' (among 

                    some of the regional polities), a 'reactionary response' (the 

                    North Indian rebellion, 1857-58), an 'acceptance' r&nbsp;esponse 

                    (radical westernisers), and an 'orthodox-renewal response' 

                    (religious reform and retrenchment). All of these latter, 

                    according to Spear, failed, and it was the 'solution of synthesis' 

                    that won the day, becoming the 'ideological secret of modern 

                    India.' ... Such, however, was hardly the 'ideological secret 

                    of modern India,' as the decades since independence have revealed 

                    ... [it was] the 'ideological secret' of only a tiny percentage 

                    of the population of modern India ...'(Larson, p 120). <b><o:p></o:p></b>
