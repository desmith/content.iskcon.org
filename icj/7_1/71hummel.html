                    <p align=JUSTIFY>During a recent conference in Cologne, two 

                      important questions were discussed: How will the course 

                      of ISKCON reform continue internally, and how will the relationship 

                      between ISKCON and German society develop in the future? 

                      The governmental changeover in Bonn gave these questions 

                      added weight: How multi-religious and multi-cultural must 

                      German society become under the leadership of the red-green 

                      coalition? 

                    <p> Five years ago (1994), at its 25-year celebration in Wiesbaden, 

                      ISKCON presented its reform plan to the German public. On 

                      Friday, the 29th of January this year, the Academy for Vaisnava 

                      Culture staged a 30-year jubilee in Cologne. On Saturday, 

                      the 30th of January, an 'interreligious podium discussion' 

                      with the theme 'Religious Minorities Meet with a Multi-cultural 

                      Germany' was initiated. Representatives of other religious 

                      minorities, namely Bahai, Islam, and Buddhism, were also 

                      invited to join in. 

                    <h5 align=LEFT><b>Dialogue with Critics</b></h5>

                    <p>The jubilee conference programme on Friday was well attended. 

                      The moderation was intelligently left up to non-members. 

                      This time the conference leaders (Saunaka Rsi and Alice 

                      Schumann) involved a section of church representatives critical 

                      towards ISKCON in the discussion: myself as retired director 

                      of The Protestant Centre for Questions of Worldview ('Evangelische 

                      Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen' - EZW), church 

                      experts on NRMs from Germany's main Christian denominations, 

                      and two protestant professors of theology - Edmund Weber 

                      (due to illness his manuscript had to be read out) and (on 

                      Saturday) Paul Schwarzenau, who had earlier spoken in favour 

                      of ISKCON and other new religious movements (NRMs). 

                    <p

                             align=LEFT>Prof. K. Klostermaier delivered a sensitive 

                      report about Vaisnava spirituality; I outlined the Church's 

                      treatment of ISKCON in Germany from the example of EZW; 

                      Alice Schumann reported on ISKCON's integration into German 

                      society; Dr Deadwyler (Ravindra Svarupa Dasa) talked about 

                      'Social Perspectives in ISKCON', or more concretely, the 

                      concept of <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>; and Saunaka Rsi spoke 

                      on the 'Development of Interreligious Dialogue in ISKCON'. 

                      Also invited to the podium were Dr Angelika Koester-Lossack, 

                      a Green Party member of the federal parliament, and the 

                      social scientist Dr J. Eiben, both engaged in the federal 

                      parliament's Commission of Enquiry regarding 'so-called 

                      cults and psycho-groups' 

                    <h5 align=LEFT><b>Religious Minorities in Germany</b></h5>

                    <p>Saturday's interreligious podium discussion about religious 

                      minorities dealt mainly with the partnership between State 

                      and Church as it developed after World War II. The Church's 

                      privileged position in this connection received some strong 

                      criticism. Attendees unanimously rejected (understandably) 

                      the defaming term 'cult'. They wanted more social recognition 

                      for religious fringe groups, greater readiness for dialogue 

                      on the part of the Church, and round table discussions at 

                      which representatives of controversial movements can have 

                      an equal say. Participants also generally agreed in criticising 

                      the cult clichés that predominate in the media and contribute 

                      toward poisoning the climate. 

                    <p> Whether religious minorities would do better by rejecting 

                      the German model or by expanding it to all religious associations 

                      remains unclear. Saunaka Rsi Dasa pleaded, if I correctly 

                      understood him, for rejection of the German model as well 

                      as for strict separation between State and religion. He 

                      deplored Germany's old-fashioned attitude toward the multi-cultural 

                      model. (Joke: Upon landing in Germany, the passengers are 

                      requested: put your watches 200 years back.) Others, including 

                      the representative of Islam, pleaded for expanding the German 

                      model, i.e. for the right of minorities to also take in 

                      taxes through the State, to be able to deliver religious 

                      education in schools, to be allowed to contribute toward 

                      the formation of policies, etc. Still these issues fall 

                      far short of having been thoroughly discussed. Expectations 

                      are now directed, above all, toward the Green Party whose 

                      representatives generally speak out in favour of State non-interference 

                      in religious affairs. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>One would advise ISKCON to become more familiar 

                      with the rights that the Federal Republic of Germany bestows 

                      on churches and religious communities and to then determine 

                      which model it favours for ISKCON and for Germany. Strict 

                      separation between State and Church may appear through the 

                      eyes of the USA or France to be the only acceptable model, 

                      but the Muslims and other religious minorities in Germany 

                      have discovered attractive aspects to the German model. 

                    <h5 align=LEFT><b> A New Style in Dealings with Church and 

                      Society</b></h5>

                    <p>Friday's jubilee session dealt mainly with ISKCON and its 

                      future. Alice Schumann, the president of ISKCON Germany, 

                      emphasised the increasing social integration of ISKCON's 

                      membership. The second, predominantly married, generation 

                      has asserted itself everywhere, among the leading managers 

                      as well as in representing ISKCON before the Commission 

                      of Enquiry. The role of women, the relationship to parents 

                      and outsiders in general and other issues were tackled, 

                      although the changes that have taken place did not receive 

                      much appreciation by the public (ISKCON should not allow 

                      itself to be too easily discouraged by this!). Several parents 

                      and representatives of cult awareness groups spoke out; 

                      desires for improved insurance coverage for those who leave 

                      the movement were loudly voiced. The Catholic Worldview 

                      Commissioner, Werner Hoebsch, recommended the model developed 

                      in the Catholic Orders for the future security of ex-members. 

                    <p>Several of ISKCON's critics appeared to have a hard time 

                      adjusting to the reforms. The old fronts cannot be maintained, 

                      a fact impossible to overlook. The ecclesiastic Commissioners 

                      of Worldviews from both major churches described the modified 

                      style of their work. Groups of priests and teachers as well 

                      as school classes visit movements like ISKCON in the movement's 

                      own centres and thus get the opportunity to gather their 

                      own impressions and make their own judgements. There are 

                      significant changes on both sides. Nevertheless, Saunaka 

                      Rsi Dasa reproached the Churches, with some justification, 

                      for not implementing recommendations for changed conduct 

                      toward NRMs given at a 1986 Amsterdam conference, which 

                      was collectively organised by the Lutheran World Federation 

                      and the Ecumenical Council of Churches. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>Extended trust-building will certainly be 

                      necessary before the new style becomes established, individual 

                      NRMs can establish closer contact with the Churches, and 

                      an atmosphere of dialogue can win through. ISKCON can be 

                      a forerunner for other movements. What is on the present 

                      agenda is that both parties energetically stand up for pacifying 

                      relations between NRMs on one side and the whole society 

                      along with the established Churches on the other. Differences 

                      of opinion and belief must not be swept under the carpet 

                      but endured and tolerated. 

                    <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>The Church's role in so-called 'cult 

                      counselling' (i.e. counselling people involved in NRMs) 

                      was contested. Movements like ISKCON understandably want 

                      counsel to be unprejudiced. For a long time sensible observers 

                      have clearly seen that, sometimes, what appears to be cult 

                      problems are in reality family problems and should be dealt 

                      with as such. On the other hand, trying to exclude the religious 

                      dimension from the consultations will help neither the grieving 

                      persons nor the movement. At least a minimal understanding 

                      of religious commitment is required. ISKCON must be concerned 

                      with this just as much as the Churches. What is still needed 

                      is more clarification in the area of tensions between NRMs, 

                      Churches and State. 

                    <h5 align=LEFT><b>Varnasrama-Dharma and Other Issues</b></h5>

                    <p align=LEFT>Besides such specific practical problems, there 

                      are fundamental theological differences between ISKCON and 

                      the Churches that I could address in my paper: the concept 

                      of an ideal society, the attitude toward militant Hindu 

                      nationalism, the power of gurus and <i>acaryas </i>over 

                      simple members, the role of women, the ability for interreligious 

                      dialogue, the collection practices. It is good for outsiders 

                      to know that in ISKCON several of these points are being 

                      vigorously worked on. The position of women for example 

                      has been re-evaluated, and some women have taken up leadership 

                      roles. ISKCON officially distanced itself from Hindu-nationalistic 

                      violence. These are important signs showing that ISKCON 

                      is ready for communication and understanding. 

                    <p align=LEFT>An example for sensible treatment of a prickly 

                      problem was Dr Deadwyler's penetrating research into the 

                      way ISKCON and its founder, Srila Prabhupada, dealt with 

                      the highly controversial social ideal of <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>. 

                      According to Deadwyler, the present agenda of ISKCON is 

                      not the forcible introduction of a 'caste system for the 

                      Occident,' as F.W. Haack called it, rather 'the primary 

                      mission of producing Vaisnavas', who then through studying 

                      and teaching acquire the qualifications to become <i>brahmanas</i>, 

                      lead society, and bring about a 'respiritualization of society' 

                      - so far, an 'unfulfilled mission'. Saunaka Rsi Dasa also 

                      emphasised two wants: education for members and properly 

                      formed spiritual leadership for the society. Even if someone, 

                      as a non-Vaisnava, would prefer to leave this <i>dharma 

                      </i>where it comes from, in India, the treatment of this 

                      subject was still impressive. The unwieldy parts of Prabhupada's 

                      programme are not simply ignored and forgotten, rather they 

                      are being theologically worked over in order to make them 

                      relevant for Western society. Even outsiders and critics 

                      will have to concede that every religious movement, including 

                      ISKCON, has an obligation to remain loyal to itself and 

                      its founder, in spite of all necessary changes. 

                    <h5 align=LEFT><b>The New Spirit of Dialogue</b></h5>

                    <p align=LEFT>Saunaka Rsi Dasa exemplified the new spirit 
                      (new from the viewpoint of critics and outsiders) with his 
                      explanation of interreligious dialogue and his commentary 
                      on 'ISKCON's Statement on Relating with People of Faith 
                      in God'. Those who are more familiar with Srila Prabhupada's 
                      teachings already know that ISKCON can relate to traditions 
                      of faith in a positive way, despite their missionary calling 
                      and their criticism of Christianity. This point having now 
                      been clearly and definitely confirmed is, for me, a milestone 
                      in ISKCON's development and its relationship toward the 
                      Churches and the religious environment in general. ISKCON 
                      thus conforms better to the modern ideal of tolerance, without 
                      forsaking its mission. Simultaneously ISKCON adheres, without 
                      damaging its distinctive profile, to inclusive tolerance, 
                      which is held in high esteem by many Hindu traditions. Even 
                      if one has reservations about this particular kind of tolerance, 
                      one would still like to encourage ISKCON to progress along 
                      this path. Whoever refuses dialogue harms himself and his 
                      movement's members, who for themselves and their families 
                      must find a respected place in the society at large.
