                      Klaus Klostermaier<br>

                      Publisher: Oneworld Publications, Oxford, 1998<br>

                      ISBN: 1-85168-175-2</span></h2>

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>If we consider the vastness of the subject, 

                      this small book by Klaus Klostermaier, University Distinguished 

                      Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the 

                      University of Manitoba, Canada, offers a remarkably complete 

                      overview of names, terms and concepts related to Hinduism. 

                    <p>To compile an encyclopedia of Hinduism is a true challenge, 

                      having in mind the enormous diversity and millennial history 

                      of that phenomenon. As the author puts it in the very beginning 

                      of his work, 'There is not a single statement that would 

                      be accepted by all Hindus as expressive of their religion, 

                      not a single symbol that all would agree upon as typifying 

                      what they worship. [...] No Hindu believes or accepts everything 

                      that is here presented as "Hinduism". Using inclusive terms 

                      like Hindu and Hinduism implies always and by necessity 

                      a certain blurring of real and important distinctions and 

                      generalizations that have to be taken with a grain of salt.' 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>In the introduction, Klaus Klostermaier offers 

                      a succinct explanation of Hinduism and its geography, history, 

                      sacred books, languages, philosophies and followers' beliefs. 

                      This brief study is essential in many ways: to those unfamiliar 

                      with the subject it gives a good understanding of the complex 

                      nature of Hinduism; for adherents of the Hindu faith in 

                      its different forms it provides a broader vision about their 

                      own teachings and practice; and to academic researchers 

                      or students it offers a scientifically credible summary 

                      of the different aspects of Hinduism. 

                    <p align=LEFT><i>A Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism</i> features 

                      people and places, scriptures and philosophical systems, 

                      art, architecture and mythology. It explains important terms 

                      that one may encounter in a more technical literature on 

                      the subject. The entries are mostly Sanskrit, transliterated 

                      with diacritics; often an English translation has been supplied. 

                      Cross-references provide fuller information by directing 

                      the reader to similar or related matters. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>Although the definitions are precise, in 

                      certain cases one would expect more elaborate explanations. 

                      Of course, in 240 pages not much can be presented in detail, 

                      and the author does not pretend to do this. With an extensive 

                      thematic bibliography at the end of the book, he directs 

                      the reader to more complete studies on the subject. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>Another useful feature of this encyclopedia 

                      is the appendix, which lists scriptures, philosophies and 

                      schools of Hinduism. The thematic index offers the reader 

                      an opportunity to explore Hinduism from a thematic point 

                      of view. The book is illustrated with well-picked black-and-white 

                      photographs and drawings (unfortunately, the photographs 

                      are not always of the best quality), and with several maps 

                      and graphics. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>Hinduism is not only a historic phenomenon 

                      but also an overwhelming&nbsp; reality. Klaus Klostermaier, 

                      having lived and worked in India for more than ten years, 

                      succeeds in presenting all the aspects of Hinduism with 

                      an ease and sympathy not often found in Western scholars 

                      of religion. The chronology offered by him at the end of 

                      the book does not support the 'Aryan invasion theory' popular 

                      in the West but instead represents the traditional view 

                      maintained by the majority of Indian scholars. 

                    <p align=JUSTIFY>Given the constraints of space and the very 

                      nature of the work, the author was forced to make choices. 

                      The followers of particular paths within Hinduism may find 

                      the information on their specific traditions insufficient 

                      but, as Klostermaier says, 'There is simply no way to do 

                      justice to any of them within the context of this enterprise.' 

                    <p align=LEFT>Vaisnavism and the founders of the four Vaisnava 

                      <i> sampradayas</i> are presented in separate entries. The 

                      <i>Encyclopedia</i> gives explanations about Gaudiya Vaisnavism, 

                      Caitanya Mahaprabhu, <i>bhakti </i>and <i>bhakti-marga</i>. 

                    <p align=LEFT>However, none of the six Goswamis of Vrndavana 

                      is listed, nor any of the promiment Gaudiya Vaisnavas after 

                      Caitanya Mahaprabhu. ISKCON is described as a branch of 

                      the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, with an international membership, 

                      founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. 

                    <p align=LEFT>Written with knowledge and insight, in a readily 

                      understandable language, <i>A Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism 

                      </i>will be a valuable reference for readers not conversant 

                      with the subject matter, for students and anyone who desires 

                      to know more about the conglomerate of philosophies and 

                      beliefs known under the name 'Hinduism'.
