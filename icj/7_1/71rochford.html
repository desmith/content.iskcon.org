                  <b>Introduction</b></div>
                <p>During the 1992 Mayapur meetings ISKCON&#146;s GBC (Governing 
                  Body Commission) established the ISKCON Global Ministry for 
                  the Centennial Celebration to plan and coordinate activities 
                  for Prabhupada's centennial in 1996. The following year the 
                  GBC passed a resolution to conduct a worldwide survey of ISKCON's 
                  membership. As stated in the resolution, the survey was intended 
                  to provide one basis for building a stronger and more unified 
                  movement.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <blockquote>

                  <p>That the Centennial Ministry organise a global survey or 
                    audit of devotees living both within ISKCON communities and 
                    outside as well as those who have left the full-time practice 
                    of Krsna consciousness, in order to help understand the steps 
                    that can be taken to develop a strong and united ISKCON.</p>

            <div class=Section1> 
              <div class=Section1> 
                <p>In the end, 1,996 devotees from 53 countries took part in the 
                  survey. As one might expect, the survey was more enthusiastically 
                  supported in some parts of the ISKCON world than others. Overall, 
                  however, the Prabhupada Centennial Survey proved a remarkable 
                  success. The survey was a massive undertaking requiring the 
                  cooperation of many many devotees around the world.</p>
                <p>This paper provides a summary of the major findings and recommendations 
                  from the Prabhupada Centennial Survey Report submitted to the 
                  GBC in November, 1998. For readers interested in reading the 
                  report in its entirety it can be located on both the &quot;Vaisnava 
                  News Network&quot; (VNN.org) and &quot;Chakra&quot; (Chakra.org) 
                  websites. </p>
                <p>There were of course many topics that might have been considered 
                  in the report. In the end I chose four. I have done so because 
                  these issues were identified by survey respondents as significant 
                  concerns or &quot;problem&quot; areas across regions of the 
                  ISKCON world. Moreover, my own research has likewise revealed 
                  their importance to ISKCON's development over the past 10-15 
                  years. The four topics considered were: (1) Family, women, and 
                  children; (2) Economic development and employment; (3) Leadership 
                  and governance; and, (4) Factors influencing devotees&#146; 
                  commitments to ISKCON. It should be clear that each of these 
                  in various ways, directly and indirectly, fit within the overarching 
                  framework of social development and the ongoing project of building 
                  an alternative social order capable of supporting a Krsna conscious 
                  lifestyle. </p>
                <p>Before discussing the four substantive issues identified above, 
                  I will first provide the reader with some background information 
                  concerning the Prabhupada Centennial Survey.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h5><b>Purposes and Goals</b></h5>
                <p>The Prabhupada Centennial Survey was meant to provide leaders 
                  &#151; GBC and Temple Presidents &#151; and devotees in general, 
                  with a comprehensive understanding of the movement's worldwide 
                  membership. This information promises to have a number of practical 
                  uses.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li> 
                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1>Accurate information on the movement's membership 
                    can help guide the GBC and other leaders as they seek to formulate 
                    local, regional, and worldwide strategies and policies to 
                    shape the movement's future (e.g., economic development, preaching, 
                    education, involvement of congregational members).</div>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>Given the diversity among devotees both between and within countries, 
                the survey allows for identifying the concerns and issues that 
                affect various constituencies of the movement's membership. 
                <div class=Section1></div>
              </li>
              <li>By identifying those issues and concerns that most influence 
                the spiritual and everyday lives of devotees, the survey's findings 
                will help leaders to focus their collective attention on concerns 
                most vital to the movement's present and future development. Too 
                often, those holding strong views have been able to create or 
                diffuse issues because leaders and others lack a comprehensive 
                understanding of the movement's rank and file membership. The 
                Prabhupada Centennial Survey affords an opportunity to gain an 
                accounting of the views, attitudes, and life circumstances of 
                devotees in and outside of institutional ISKCON. 
                <div class=Section1></div>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1>The survey serves an important symbolic 
                    purpose. The very act of conducting the survey communicates 
                    to all devotees that ISKCON's leadership is willing to engage 
                    the serious issues that confront the movement. The survey 
                    conveys that leaders are genuinely concerned with the health 
                    of Prabhupada's movement.</div>
                </div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <div class=Section1> 
              <div class=Section1> 
                <p>The findings presented in the report demand discussion and 
                  debate. Without it there can be little basis for constructive 
                  change and progress toward realising the potential of Prabhupada's 
                  movement for his many followers worldwide. I am pleased to say 
                  that these discussions are already well underway as suggested 
                  by recent Social Development Conferences, Women's Conferences, 
                  and the creation of GBC Ministries addressing social development, 
                  grhastha life, women, and youth. All of these efforts have sought 
                  in various ways to address aspects of ISKCON's social and cultural 
                  development. Of equal importance of course have been the many 
                  ongoing discussions among devotees about the state of the movement 
                  and how to bring about a greater sense of balance and harmony 
                  between their spiritual beliefs and practices, and other aspects 
                  of daily life. The issues that have emerged raise serious questions 
                  about the state of Prabhupada's movement, as indicated by a 
                  report released in 1998 from the ISKCON Commission for Social 
                  Development. The report begins with the following observations:

                <div class=Section1> 
                  <p>As the GBC concluded at its 1996 special meeting in Abentheur, 
                    &quot;ISKCON&#146;s house is on fire.&quot; The movement faces 
                    serious social problems. Devotees are dissatisfied, confused 
                    about their responsibilities and hampered in achieving their 
                    full potentials. Everyone is suffering, leaders as well as 
                    rank-and-file. Women, children and cows are unprotected and 
                    abused. Many who for years dedicated themselves to preaching 
                    and devotional service are now outsiders. Others are &quot;hanging 
                    on&quot; with diminishing hope of finding a secure, decent 
                    life in ISKCON. Others who should be free to be models of 
                    renunciation and spiritual leadership are perceived to be 
                    entangled with money and power.</p>

                <h5><b>Issues and Questions</b></h5>
                <p>The initial step undertaken was to gain a preliminary sampling 
                  of the views and insights of devotees from various parts of 
                  the world. This included identifying issues of concern for all 
                  devotees; grand disciples, uninitiated devotees, as well as 
                  disciples of Srila Prabhupada. Advice was sought from committed 
                  ISKCON followers as well as from more marginal devotees and 
                  even those estranged from ISKCON. Formal and informal discussions 
                  also took place with various members of the GBC and other ISKCON 
                  leaders.</p>
                <p>Issues addressed on the survey were identified primarily through 
                  working groups of devotees from various parts of the world. 
                  Groups in North America, Western Europe, and India contributed 
                  detailed suggestions and even specific questions to include 
                  on the final questionnaire. Individual devotees also wrote to 
                  me directly offering their ideas. In addition, a group comprised 
                  of myself and eight devotees reworked a preliminary draft of 
                  the questionnaire at the Mayapur meetings in 1994. The questionnaire 
                  was subsequently revised still further, given the suggestions 
                  made by members of the GBC subcommittee for the Prabhupada Centennial 
                  Survey.</p>
                <p>The following issues were identified by devotees as potential 
                  areas of inquiry for the Prabhupada Centennial Survey.</p>

                <p>These and other areas of inquiry were addressed in the Prabhupada 
                  Centennial Survey. The full range of topics and issues can best 
                  be discerned by reviewing the questionnaire itself (see Appendix 
                  1 in the final report). I think it important to note that approximately 
                  80% of the questions appearing on the final Centennial questionnaire 
                  were based on questions submitted by devotees in and outside 
                  of ISKCON.</p>
                <p>The final questionnaire was translated into eight languages 
                  (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Russian, Polish, Italian, German, 
                  Czech). Translations of the questionnaire were completed either 
                  by native-speaking ISKCON devotees, or by language teachers 
                  at Middlebury College. The latter translations were checked 
                  by ISKCON members who spoke the language to be certain that 
                  translations were accurate and reflected devotee ways of speaking.

                <h5><b>Sample and Sampling Procedures</b></h5>
                <p>Perhaps the most important yet most difficult part of the Prabhupada 
                  Centennial Survey was distributing the questionnaires throughout 
                  ISKCON's worldwide community. This proved a massive and at times 
                  difficult undertaking, requiring the good will and practical 
                  assistance of many devotees. </p>
                <p>Distribution and sampling guidelines were provided to Temple 
                  Presidents and/or designated survey representatives along with 
                  a copy (or copies) of the questionnaire itself. Copies of each 
                  document were mailed to all of ISKCON's communities and preaching 
                  centres worldwide. The actual sampling and distribution guidelines 
                  are included in Appendix 2 of the complete report. </p>
                <p>Despite efforts to ensure a degree of rigor in the sampling 
                  process, the results were uneven at best. Some communities did 
                  follow the guidelines carefully; others simply asked everyone 
                  in the community to complete the questionnaire; some only distributed 
                  the questionnaire to temple devotees; and, some communities 
                  failed to distribute the questionnaire at all. Given this pattern 
                  of distribution and the resulting sample, a few words about 
                  representativeness seem appropriate.</p>
                <p>The data collected from the Prabhupada Centennial Survey can 
                  not be considered representative of the total ISKCON membership. 
                  Neither can the findings from a particular region or country 
                  be considered representative. Despite efforts to ensure a more 
                  or less representative sample, the final sample is not a probability 
                  sample. A basic principle of probability sampling is that &quot;a 
                  sample will be representative of the population [in this case 
                  ISKCON's worldwide membership] if all members of the population 
                  have an equal chance of being selected in the sample&quot; (Babbie 
                  1998:200). Obviously this did not happen here for a number of 
                  reasons. Many ISKCON communities don't have accurate lists of 
                  their members. Moreover, the scale of the Prabhupada Centennial 
                  Survey hardly allowed for careful and precise sampling techniques. 
                  But even carefully selected samples are often less than perfectly 
                  representative. It is also fair to say that most surveys done 
                  in the social sciences are based upon less than representative 
                  samples. I don&#146;t raise these issues here in order to dismiss 
                  the data and findings from the Prabhupada Centennial Survey, 
                  for the fact is that the information gathered is the most comprehensive 
                  ever collected on ISKCON or, for that matter, any worldwide 
                  religious organisation that I am aware of. However, it is important 
                  that the reader view the findings presented here as reasonable 
                  estimates, rather than precise figures.</p>

                <h5><b>Data and Data Processing</b></h5>
                <p>After collecting the nearly 2,000 completed questionnaires 
                  the data had to be entered onto the computer before analysis 
                  could begin. This task took many hundreds of hours of work and 
                  proved costly. The questionnaire was over 20 pages in length 
                  with over 300 variables having numerical information. There 
                  were also several open-ended questions where devotees wrote 
                  out answers to questions. Students from Middlebury College were 
                  paid to enter the data on the computer. This took one year to 
                  complete.<a href="#1">(1)</a><a name="1up"></a> </p>
                <p> </p>
                <h5><b>Units of Analysis</b></h5>
                <p>The units of analysis for the report were: (1) Types of devotees, 
                  or ISKCON members (i.e., full-time ISKCON members, congregational 
                  members, former ISKCON devotees). As one might reasonably expect, 
                  the views, commitment, involvement, etc. of the three devotee 
                  groups varied on some, if not many issues. Where appropriate, 
                  I have given emphasis to these differences in the analyses presented 
                  in the report; and, (2) Region of the world (i.e., North America, 
                  Northern and Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the CIS, Latin 
                  America, Australasia, Africa, and Asia). Countries were placed 
                  into regions using the classification in &quot;Centres Around 
                  the World&quot; as found in Back To Godhead Magazine. I had 
                  expected to treat India as a separate region but the limited 
                  number of respondents did not warrant doing so. Table 1 reports 
                  on the number of respondents by country for each of the seven 
                  regions. </p>

                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1>There is a striking lack of trust between 
                    ISKCON members and the movement's leadership, as well as between 
                    devotees themselves. Survey respondents across regions expressed 
                    the view that there is a lack of honest and open communication 
                    between devotees; that impersonalism has been allowed to dominate 
                    devotee relations in place of friendship, respect, and caring. 
                    The findings presented also demonstrate that a lack of authority 
                    (and a related lack of trust) attributed to the gurus and/or 
                    the GBC institution has had major consequences for devotees' 
                    commitments to ISKCON (full-time, congregational, and former 
                    ISKCON members alike).<br>

                </div>
              </li>
              <li> Many devotee respondents expressed the view that ISKCON suffers 
                from poor management and that leaders are not always responsive 
                to those they serve. There is reason to suspect that this only 
                breeds mistrust and a sense that local as well as regional leaders 
                are out of touch with the needs and lives of the average member.

                <br>
                <div class=Section1></div>
              </li>
              <li> A set of concerns expressed by devotees worldwide falls under 
                the general heading of social development. As the data demonstrate 
                conclusively, the nuclear family has effectively displaced communalism 
                as the movement's foundational structure of social organisation 
                in most parts of the world. Even in the newly formed ISKCON communities 
                in Eastern Europe and the CIS, a sizeable percentage of householders 
                are living and working outside the movement's communities. By 
                favouring a renunciate-sectarian model organisationally in the 
                face of an expanding grhastha asrama, ISKCON has generally failed 
                to integrate families and family life into its communities. Until 
                recent discussions of &quot;social development,&quot; ISKCON has 
                done little toward building an internal domestic culture capable 
                of supporting householders and their children. Two elements of 
                social development were given special attention by survey respondents: 
              </li>
              <blockquote> 
                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1>(a) The lack of employment opportunities 
                    within ISKCON. As the findings demonstrate, a large portion 
                    of ISKCON's worldwide membership is working in conventional 
                    jobs. As <i>sankirtana</i> has become (and becomes) less of 
                    a source of revenue for ISKCON's communities, devotees have 
                    been forced to seek employment in the outside labour market. 
                    This has primarily affected householders. The result is that 
                    devotees working in non-devotee work environments are less 
                    involved in and committed to their religious beliefs and practices, 
                    and to ISKCON as a religious organisation. Of telling significance 
                    is that 80% of the respondents working outside of ISKCON say 
                    they would work within the movement, if employment was available 
                    allowing them to support themselves and/or their families. 
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1>The survey findings give further support 
                    to ongoing discussions concerning the urgency of developing 
                    <i>varnasrama</i> within ISKCON. Although <i>varnasrama</i> 
                    appears to mean different things to different devotees it 
                    nonetheless remains clear that there is a pervasive belief 
                    that something must be done to ensure that ISKCON members 
                    have the opportunity to work together, rather than in non-devotee 
                    jobs. </div>
                </div>
                <div class=Section1> 
                  <div class=Section1><br>
                    (b) Inadequate educational alternatives within ISKCON. Findings 
                    from the survey suggest that children, like their parents, 
                    are spending a good portion of their daily lives associating 
                    with non-devotees while attending schools outside of ISKCON's 
                    communities. As the evidence presented suggests, parents report 
                    that their children often grow up having few commitments to 
                    ISKCON and, more often than not, remain more or less uninvolved 
                    in the practice of sadhana-bhakti. While such a finding is 
                    hardly unusual, as many young people become estranged from 
                    their religious faith in adolescence, it still raises questions 
                    about ISKCON's future given the paucity of new adult recruits 
                    to the movement in at least some parts of the world. In the 
                    case of young devotee children who attend public/state-supported 
                    schools there is another force at work which differs from 
                    the average non-devotee young person who withdraws from his 
                    or her faith during adolescence. As I have shown elsewhere 
                    (Rochford 1999), attending public/state-supported schools 
                    for devotee youths tends to erode their collective identity 
                    as ISKCON members; although many hold to their identity as 
                    devotees of Krsna. In seeking social acceptance from their 
                    new non-devotee peers, devotee young people have essentially 
                    felt the need to subvert their ISKCON identity to avoid the 
                    stigma attached to being a Hare Krsna.</div>

            <div class=Section1> 
              <div class=Section1> 
                <p>Without adequate schools to train ISKCON's children spiritually 
                  and academically one can only expect that more and more parents 
                  will choose to educate their children outside the movement. 
                  While most survey respondents suggest a preference for asrama-based 
                  gurukulas one wonders if such a view continues to hold given 
                  recent revelations about child abuse within the asramas during 
                  the 1970s and 1980s (See Bharata Shrestha Dasa 1998; Rochford 
                  1998a). It may be that the asrama-based schools are seen as 
                  a viable alternative because some parents express general dissatisfaction 
                  with the spiritual and academic training provided by their local 
                  ISKCON community day-school. Also, of course, Prabhupada established 
                  these schools with the spiritual interests of the children in 
                  mind.</p>

              <li> Both women and men recognise that (mis)treatment of women within 
                the movement over the years has negatively affected women's sense 
                of self-esteem and limited their ability to make spiritual progress. 
                Most also agreed that the climate toward women within ISKCON has 
                improved in recent years. Men and women supported the idea that 
                women's roles should be expanded within ISKCON and that women, 
                being the spiritual equals of men, should have the same opportunities 
                for devotional service where performance, not gender, is the determining 
                criteria. As was true during the early days of the movement (see 
                Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi 1997) respondents tended to agree (with some 
                gender variations) that men and women should worship on different 
                sides of the temple (rather than women at the back), chant japa 
                collectively in the temple (slightly less than a majority of men 
                support this idea), that women should be able to lead public kirtanas 
                in the temple, give classes, and serve as Temple Presidents when 
                qualified. Fewer men and women supported the idea of women serving 
                as gurus.<br>
                <br>
                <div class=Section1></div>
              </li>
              <li> Of critical importance to the stability of ISKCON has been 
                the erosion of traditional religious authority in the face of 
                scandal and controversy involving ISKCON's gurus and sannyasis 
                (see Rochford 1985,1998b; Tamal Krsna Goswami 1997). These very 
                scandals have served to promote ritvik ideas, both within ISKCON's 
                communities and among dissidents outside ISKCON's ranks. But even 
                among devotees who reject the ritvik philosophy there still has 
                been an effort to further elevate Prabhupada as the primary source 
                of religious authority within ISKCON. In sum, the authority of 
                the present gurus has been openly questioned and Srila Prabhupada 
                has become the source of legitimate religious authority within 
                ISKCON and the broader movement. <br>
                <br>
                Because of continuing scandal involving gurus, survey respondents 
                expressed a desire to place strong bureaucratic controls on qualifications 
                for becoming an ISKCON guru, and on the behavior and lifestyle 
                of the gurus. Many respondents offered the view that the reform 
                movement of the mid-1980s did not go far enough in placing adequate 
                controls on the independent authority and power of ISKCON's gurus.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li> Related to the demise of religious authority has been the apparent 
                decline of GBC authority among some portions of ISKCON's membership. 
                Many congregational members for example expressed the belief that 
                they have been left with little input in how ISKCON is governed. 
                As a result many felt that the GBC had little real relevance to 
                their lives as devotees. This is perhaps most pronounced in the 
                area of the GBC's failure to address the needs of householders 
                and their children. A sizeable percentage of ISKCON's congregational 
                members believed that a representational form of government would 
                help broaden the variety of viewpoints found on the GBC. Full-time 
                members, congregational members and former ISKCON devotees alike 
                expressed the view that the GBC had not gone far enough in its 
                efforts to control the gurus and the guru institution. 
                <div class=Section1></div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class=Section1> 
              <div class=Section1> 
                <p>As the statistical analyses presented in the report demonstrate, 
                  member commitment to ISKCON is most influenced by views about 
                  the GBC and ISKCON's gurus (among a number of other variables, 
                  see Tables 12-14 in the report). For full-time members the authority 
                  placed in the GBC had a strong influence on ISKCON commitment. 
                  Those full-time respondents who viewed the GBC favorably (having 
                  a high level of authority) were also most likely to be highly 
                  committed to ISKCON. Conversely, those who saw the GBC as having 
                  little authority were more likely to have less commitment to 
                  ISKCON. Interestingly, guru authority was not a significant 
                  predictor of ISKCON commitment for initiated full-time ISKCON 
                  members. For congregational members the authority of the GBC 
                  had a significant influence on commitment to ISKCON; yet the 
                  strongest influence for initiated congregational members was 
                  the authority of the gurus. The pattern among former ISKCON 
                  members parallels the findings for full-time members. The authority 
                  of the GBC had by far the greatest influence on ISKCON commitment 
                  with the authority of the gurus having no significant effect.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h5><b>Recommendations</b></h5>
                <p>The findings presented in the report document the ongoing change 
                  of ISKCON as a religious organisation. It points to the existing 
                  and building tensions between a monastic, high commitment, and 
                  communal form of social organisation and one characterised by 
                  independent householders whose religious and organisational 
                  commitments are often less intense and whose involvements are 
                  more irregular and segmental. These findings are compatible 
                  with other studies of ISKCON in North America (Rochford 1995b, 
                  1997) and in Western and Eastern Europe (Rochford 1995a, forthcoming). 
                  With the decline of communalism many devotees &#151; especially 
                  householders and their children &#151; spend much of their everyday 
                  lives within mainstream cultures, either working outside jobs 
                  and/or attending state-supported or other non-ISKCON schools. 
                  As devotees have moved outside the movement's communal structure 
                  to establish independent households, ISKCON has lost its previous 
                  control over the lives and behavior of its membership (Rochford 
                  1995b). Communal control has been vastly reduced and individual 
                  devotees freely make choices about how they wish to live their 
                  lives and raise their children. ISKCON, as this implies, can 
                  be characterised as an increasingly pluralistic movement comprised 
                  of members with strikingly different commitments and levels 
                  of involvement. Given this pattern of change the question of 
                  paramount importance is how will ISKCON go about the task of 
                  integrating this increasingly diverse congregation into its 
                  communities? Perhaps more to the point, is it the position of 
                  the leadership that families should be, in fact, more fully 
                  integrated into ISKCON and its communities? But this question 
                  raises a broader one that I think must be answered by leaders 
                  and anyone else who claims either membership in ISKCON, or to 
                  be a follower of Prabhupada. </p>
                <p>What is your image of what ISKCON should be. What should it 
                  aspire to in the future? Is the ideal ISKCON you hold in your 
                  mind's eye tied largely to the movement's past; communities 
                  of devotees living communally, members dedicated first and foremost 
                  to missionary activity, a membership with high levels of commitment 
                  to and involvement in ISKCON and Krsna consciousness, sannyasis 
                  with considerable political as well as spiritual authority and 
                  power? Or, is your image of ISKCON one that more reflects ISKCON 
                  as we see it today in the West, and increasingly in other parts 
                  of the world; a congregation of people holding varying levels 
                  of commitment to ISKCON and their Krsna conscious beliefs and 
                  practices, where members are as much or more involved in the 
                  conventional world as with ISKCON? </p>
                <p>I raise these questions only because the meaning that readers 
                  give to the findings presented in the report relate directly 
                  to their visions of ISKCON and what Prabhupada's movement &quot;should 
                  be.&quot; Just as obviously, any person's recommendations about 
                  what must be done to make ISKCON a better instrument for Prabhupada's 
                  movement will also be derived from these at least somewhat idiosyncratic 
                  images. To someone committed to a life of renunciation, preaching, 
                  and communalism, ongoing changes in the direction of pluralism 
                  and congregationalism can only been seen as trends that lead 
                  ISKCON away from its true purposes. For others, these very same 
                  changes reflect the building strength of the movement because 
                  it is increasingly reaching into conventional societies in more 
                  diverse and perhaps influential ways.</p>
                <p>As a sociologist, my own images of ISKCON are seen through 
                  lenses shaped by theory and research in the sociology of religion. 
                  I assume that change is an inevitable part of the development 
                  of any religious organisation or community; though, it is true, 
                  that some groups have remained far more resistant to change 
                  than others. Yet there is a clear tendency in the social science 
                  of religion to attend to the social forces that push religious 
                  groups and movements in the direction of secularisation (accommodation 
                  to the conventional secular culture and its values and way of 
                  life). I believe, for example, that the inability to integrate 
                  family life within ISKCON's communities has been a (if not the) 
                  major force giving rise to growing congregationalism (Rochford 
                  1995a, 1995b, 1997). The widespread concern throughout the movement 
                  today with issues of social development suggests that many devotees 
                  share such a point of view. For, in fact, social development 
                  as presently being discussed in ISKCON is largely about families 
                  and family life.</p>
                <p>I offer the following recommendations for no reason other than 
                  to help guide the leadership as it considers the question of 
                  ISKCON's social development and the broader future of the movement. 
                  I am not trying to tell the leaders what to do, although at 
                  times it may seem like it. Rather my intention is to suggest 
                  what could be done and what areas represent the most immediate 
                  problems requiring attention. </p>
                <p>In the most general terms, it is time for ISKCON's leaders 
                  to move beyond the crisis mode. Most well informed members or 
                  observers of ISKCON realise that ISKCON's leaders have spent 
                  the last 20 years &quot;putting out fires&quot; of one sort 
                  or another. While this has been a necessary stance it has made 
                  it impossible for the leadership to address the fundamental 
                  needs of ISKCON's membership. In fighting battles of one sort 
                  or another, be they internal (e.g., guru issues) or external 
                  (e.g., lawsuits), the fact is many devotees, most particularly 
                  householders, have come to believe that the leadership has failed 
                  to vigorously address their needs. ISKCON has evolved as a religious 
                  movement, but that evolution, more often than not, has been 
                  unplanned and spontaneous. As the findings presented here suggest, 
                  members often feel estranged and powerless because they believe 
                  that the leadership is generally unresponsive to their needs 
                  for devotee-based employment, education for their children, 
                  fair-minded and efficient management, and the like. Please understand 
                  I am talking perception. But this perception has ultimately 
                  eroded the fundamental trust between those who lead and ISKCON's 
                  membership. I believe that one result of this is that many devotees 
                  are aligning themselves with the ritvik movement and other challenging 
                  groups not out of any conviction about what Prabhupada intended 
                  for the guru system, but because they are frustrated and even 
                  angry that ISKCON's leadership has not responded constructively 
                  as they struggle to raise their families in Krsna consciousness. 
                  I think it time for the leadership to dedicate itself (even 
                  in the midst of present and future &quot;fires&quot;) to making 
                  progress on a few specific issues that will benefit ISKCON's 
                  membership. In saying this I realise that progress has been 
                  made on a number of fronts such as child protection and education. 
                  But more could be done and this should be made an institutional 
                  priority and not one that grows out of an immediate problem 
                  that must be fixed. Think and plan pro-actively. There is both 
                  real and symbolic value in such an approach. Devotees' needs 
                  will be better served and, in time, the membership will come 
                  to trust that the leaders have their interests squarely in mind.</p>
                <p>Given this perhaps overly bold preamble, allow me to raise 
                  a few specific issues that are candidates for immediate attention. 
                  Some will take long-term planning and involve considerable resources. 
                  Others could be done rather quickly given the will of the GBC. 
                  I begin with economics, because I think a number of other things 
                  rest on building an adequate economic infrastructure to support 
                  devotees and ISKCON's communities.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><b>(1) </b>Building an Economic Infrastructure. As this report 
                  has amply demonstrated, devotees &#151; especially householders 
                  &#151; have been forced to seek employment outside of ISKCON's 
                  communities. The results of this trend have not always been 
                  beneficial to ISKCON or to the spiritual lives of devotees themselves. 
                  ISKCON members working outside are less likely to remain as 
                  involved in their religious practices, are less involved in 
                  and committed to ISKCON, are more involved in the outside conventional 
                  culture, and less committed to a Krsna conscious worldview. 
                </p>
                <p>But the unavailability of movement/devotee-based employment 
                  has other implications for ISKCON and its membership. Over the 
                  last few years greater attention has been focused on education 
                  within ISKCON. This has involved educating new adult members 
                  to the movement as well as children growing up in ISKCON. While 
                  most people would applaud these efforts it remains the case 
                  that, even should ISKCON build a laudable system of education, 
                  a serious problem remains. Even if ISKCON were able to build 
                  a gurukula system that was &quot;ideal&quot; (however defined), 
                  it still remains the case that young men and women who complete 
                  their secondary education have little or no future within ISKCON's 
                  communities. This is because there are few paying jobs that 
                  would allow devotees to be self-supporting, especially if they 
                  have families. However educated ISKCON's young adults become, 
                  they ultimately have few viable options open to them except 
                  to seek employment in the conventional labour market. This very 
                  fact suggests that ISKCON's social needs must be considered 
                  holistically. It is not enough to &quot;fix&quot; one part of 
                  ISKCON's social system without addressing the system as a whole. 
                  Prabhupada, and many of his followers, have suggested that <i>varnasrama 
                  </i>provides such a holistic solution.<a href="#2">(2)</a><a name="2up"></a> 
                </p>
                <p>Leaders have to think of <i>sankirtana</i> primarily in terms 
                  of preaching, rather than in terms of the financial resources 
                  it brings. Without question <i>sankirtana</i> has brought large 
                  sums of money into ISKCON and has bankrolled ISKCON's worldwide 
                  expansion (Rochford 1985). Yet in every case that I am aware 
                  of, <i>sankirtana</i> revenues begin to diminish in time, most 
                  often at the very moment when householder life expands and the 
                  need for resources increases. <i>Sankirtana</i> should be considered 
                  a short-term economic strategy; one that can help finance other 
                  types of entrepreneurial activity supportive of ISKCON's membership 
                  and ISKCON itself. Without a stable financial base ISKCON's 
                  communities have fragmented and devotees have in various ways 
                  lost the social supports that encouraged their spiritual pursuits 
                  and goals for self-realisation.</p>
                <p>I recommend that the GBC immediately establish regional economic 
                  committees comprised of devotees who have proven themselves 
                  productive businessmen and businesswomen and/or economic strategists. 
                  I say regional because I expect that while a movement-wide economic 
                  strategy might be possible, it is more likely that economic 
                  plans will vary by region, country, and perhaps even by community. 
                  These planning committees should be given authority to develop 
                  economic proposals, raise funds to launch businesses, and maintain 
                  a degree of autonomy that allows for working without being compromised 
                  by political considerations. I think the goal of these committees 
                  should centre foremost on employment for devotees, not raising 
                  money per se. Entrepreneurial activity that is labour intensive 
                  and capable of employing large numbers of people should be favoured. 
                  Computer businesses may be profitable for example but they are 
                  usually incapable of employing significant numbers of people. 
                  Work, not profit, should be the fundamental goal.</p>
                <p><b>(2) </b>Restoring Trust in the Leadership. This report has 
                  shown conclusively that the authority (or lack thereof) of ISKCON's 
                  gurus and the GBC represent the most significant predictors 
                  of member commitment to ISKCON. Quite simply, it is clear that 
                  many ISKCON members (temple devotees, congregational members) 
                  and former members alike place minimal trust in ISKCON's leadership. 
                  Child abuse, the mistreatment and abuse of women, the neglect 
                  of householders, guru scandals, etc., all have eroded the trust 
                  that binds devotees to Prabhupada's movement. In organisational 
                  terms as well as spiritual ones, ISKCON at its core is in the 
                  midst of a crisis of trust. As Seligman argues, the &quot;existence 
                  of trust is an essential component of all enduring social relationships&quot; 
                  (1997:13) and is indeed necessary for the continuation of any 
                  social order. Leaders can only be effective when followers have 
                  faith in those entrusted with positions of leadership. This 
                  is not uniformly the case in many portions of the ISKCON world. 
                  Now, with the demise of Harikesa Dasa, there is reason to believe 
                  that this crisis has grown deeper. </p>
                <p>I recommend that the GBC immediately form a committee whose 
                  purpose is to consider how the movement's leadership can restore 
                  the trust of ISKCON's membership as well as among those who 
                  have chosen to leave the movement. The committee's work should 
                  not be about how to strategically defend ISKCON against its 
                  critics. Rather it should focus on how to honestly address the 
                  concerns of devotees who have been mistreated and abused directly, 
                  or by the policies of ISKCON's leadership. As an act of good 
                  faith, the committee should consider the possibility of including 
                  a limited number of devotees who have been critical of the leadership. 
                  Obviously such persons, like all other members of the committee, 
                  would be required to affirm his or her commitment to the committee's 
                  goals and purposes. </p>
                <p><b>(3) </b>Re-enfranchising ISKCON Women. It is clear that 
                  both women and men see the need to expand women's spiritual 
                  and material roles within the movement. As the findings demonstrate, 
                  there is considerable support for women playing a more active 
                  and equal role in ISKCON's spiritual and community life. Men 
                  and women overwhelmingly agree that Prabhupada viewed his male 
                  and female disciples as spiritual equals. And there is evidence 
                  that Prabhupada implemented policies and procedures that were 
                  meant to be inclusive of women. It seems clear that the majority 
                  of the devotees surveyed want women to have rights and responsibilities 
                  as given to them by Srila Prabhupada before a backlash against 
                  women occurred in the early and mid-1970s (see Ravindra Svarupa 
                  Dasa 1994; Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi 1997; Radha Devi Dasi 1998).</p>
                <p>While ISKCON has an obligation to protect women (Executive 
                  Committee Letter 1998), leaders also have a responsibility to 
                  keep ISKCON a functioning organisation able to preach and meet 
                  the spiritual needs of its membership. Given the manpower shortages 
                  that exist in many temples, ISKCON can ill-afford to disenfranchise 
                  a large portion of its membership. While wrong theologically 
                  (Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi, 1997), and with respect to fundamental 
                  human rights (Radha Devi Dasi 1998), it is also simply foolish 
                  as an organisational strategy. While many regions of the ISKCON 
                  world are in desperate need of human capital to deal with the 
                  day-to-day functioning of temple communities, it remains the 
                  case that women and women's contributions too often remain under-valued 
                  and under-utilised. Organisationally ISKCON can't afford such 
                  a position and in fact there are growing numbers of women serving 
                  as Temple Presidents and holding other significant management 
                  and administrative positions (Rochford 1998c). </p>
                <p>I recommend that ISKCON leaders immediately move to restore 
                  the rights and responsibilities afforded women by Srila Prabhupada. 
                  Men should be educated accordingly. (A good start for everyone 
                  would be to read the articles by Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi 1997, 
                  and Radha Devi Dasi 1998.)<a href="#3">(3)</a><a name="3up"></a> 
                  Guru and non-guru leaders should teach respect for women; women 
                  should again be viewed as capable devotees in the service of 
                  Prabhupada's movement rather than as temptresses or other such 
                  derogatory characterisations. To do so would immediately increase 
                  the self-esteem of women and make them more productive members 
                  of ISKCON. By acknowledging women's value and worth as human 
                  and spiritual beings it will also make the movement more attractive 
                  to potential members who view ISKCON's position on women as 
                  antiquated and morally objectionable.</p>
                <p><b>(4) </b>Education and Children. ISKCON is slowly losing 
                  its most significant resource for the future: its children. 
                  A startling percentage of the movement's children are leaving 
                  ISKCON or are choosing to remain marginal to it (see Kraybill 
                  1989, on the retention of Amish children into adulthood). Friendships 
                  and ties with parents often have more holding power on ISKCON's 
                  second generation than ties to ISKCON, or even to the practice 
                  of Krsna consciousness. Certainly, child abuse has directly 
                  and indirectly affected a significant portion of ISKCON's now 
                  young-adults, but this is only one part of the story. For the 
                  fact is that ISKCON has yet to find an adequate replacement 
                  to the asrama system of schooling. Many parents in the survey 
                  express the view that the ISKCON day-school in their community 
                  is not adequately meeting the spiritual and academic needs of 
                  children. Teachers too often feel that ISKCON has not done nearly 
                  enough to support them in their efforts to create better schools. 
                </p>
                <p>Over the past two years ISKCON's leadership has committed itself 
                  to improving education within the movement both for adult members 
                  and children. From what I can tell, a substantial start has 
                  been made on this front. Yet this initiative has recently been 
                  hampered by the defection of Harikesa Dasa and the loss of resources 
                  he had committed to educational projects. Yet ISKCON must begin 
                  to build for the future, and like any society that prospers, 
                  education must become part of the equation that produces that 
                  prosperity. Here I mean education in the broadest sense of the 
                  word. Parents, with the assistance of ISKCON, must educate their 
                  children, but this education must be centred on goals and purposes 
                  that are distinct to ISKCON as a religious organisation. Because 
                  of this, ISKCON has a central role to play in the socialisation 
                  and education of the movement's youngest members. In doing the 
                  job well, ISKCON promises to reap the benefits of a core of 
                  young, enthusiastic devotees wanting to push forward Prabhupada's 
                  movement. To fail means that ISKCON has essentially squandered 
                  its most vital resource and the basis of its future. One only 
                  has to stand to the back of any temple in North America to see 
                  that there is a clear &quot;graying of the Hare Krsnas.&quot; 
                  (This too will likely be an issue of significance in the immediate 
                  future.)</p>
                <p>I believe that the movement has to continue in its efforts 
                  to acknowledge the mistreatment of second generation devotees 
                  in the 1970s and 1980s. It also has to do whatever possible 
                  to respond to the real needs of these young men and women. Certainly 
                  &quot;Children of Krsna&quot; is precisely such an initiative. 
                  But ISKCON's leaders must continue to work with and provide 
                  resources to teachers and schools if the movement is to nurture 
                  the development of its children. </p>
                <p>I recommend that recent efforts to improve education within 
                  ISKCON continue at full-pace. The education committee now in 
                  place must continue to receive the financial and other means 
                  of support it needs to promote education in ISKCON. Of equal 
                  importance, the leadership must not waver in its commitment 
                  to education and thereby to ISKCON's future hope. Educators 
                  and children must be seen as the keepers of ISKCON's future, 
                  not simply as parties who make demands on scarce resources. 
                  The sociologist of religion, Rodney Stark, writes that any new 
                  religion which hopes to succeed must &quot;find important things 
                  for young people to do on behalf of their faith&quot; (1987:25). 
                  It is time that ISKCON provides the training and support its 
                  children need in order to meet the challenges that lie ahead 
                  for ISKCON in the twenty-first century. </p>

                <p><a name="1"></a><a href="#1up">(1)</a> I would like to express 
                  my appreciation to Middlebury College for providing substantial 
                  funding so that this project could be completed.</p>
                <p><a name="2"></a><a href="#2up">(2)</a> I have consciously avoided 
                  any discussion of <i>varnasrama</i> in the report. I did so 
                  largely because this is an ongoing discussion and there are 
                  varied ideas about what <i>varnasrama</i> is and how ISKCON 
                  should implement it. I will make only one comment: It is important 
                  to understand that &quot;simple living and plain thinking&quot; 
                  in the context of a land-based agricultural society does not 
                  fit the character and background of many Western devotees and 
                  others. Moreover, devotees are now working in a great variety 
                  of positions in and outside of ISKCON. Whatever version of <i>varnasrama</i> 
                  that comes to the fore must consider who might be pushed out 
                  under such a system as well as how the system should work. Remember, 
                  &quot;time, place, and circumstance;&quot; the wisdom of this, 
                  sociologically, can not be overstated.</p>
                <p><a name="3"></a><a href="#3up">(3)</a> I am aware that some 
                  leaders and other devotees believe that the essays by Jyotirmayi 
                  Devi Dasi and Radha Devi Dasi do not accurately, or fully, represent 
                  Prabhupada's position on women in ISKCON. Should the GBC remain 
                  split on this question, a research group should be commissioned 
                  to investigate the issue further. Of course even this is a tricky 
                  proposition since Prabhupada's views are inevitably &quot;frozen 
                  in time&quot; and, therefore, we lose a sense of &quot;time, 
                  place, and circumstance.&quot; Much has happened in the past 
                  21 years and it is impossible to know what Prabhupada's views 
                  on the &quot;women's question&quot; might be in the present. 
                  Of course the theological significance of the problem I am pointing 
                  to goes well beyond debates about women's roles within ISKCON.</p>
