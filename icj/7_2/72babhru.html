            <h4 class="maintextsubhead">Author: Swami B.V. Tripurari<br>
              Publisher: Harmonist Publishers, 1998</h4>
            <p>In his introduction to <i>Sri Guru-parampara, </i>Swami B.V. Tripurari 
              says the essay's purpose is 'to examine the sensitive issue of Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati Thakura's critique of prevalent practices in the [Gaudiya 
              Vaisnava] <i>sampradaya </i>and his analysis of the modalities of 
              <i>raganuga-sadhana</i>'. Tripurari Maharaja then clearly, directly 
              and systematically confronts criticisms of the line of Gaudiya Vaisnavism 
              issuing from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, and in doing so demonstrates 
              its authenticity without the high degree of contentiousness that 
              often attends this controversy.</p>
            <p>The booklet begins by exploring the aspect of <i>raganuga-bhakti</i> 
              commonly practised by Bhaktivinoda and Bhaktisiddhanta's contemporaries, 
              known as the <i>siddha-pranali</i> system. As ISKCON devotees are 
              aware, Bhaktisiddhanta and his followers have not emphasised this 
              practice. This is partly because its too-liberal dissemination has 
              historically resulted in immoral behaviour disguised as spontaneous 
              devotion, which has in turn diminished public regard for Sri Caitanya 
              Mahaprabhu's movement. The qualification for this initiation has 
              generally been the candidates' eagerness for knowledge of their 
              eternal relationship with Krsna in Vraja. However, citing Jiva Goswami, 
              Visvanatha Cakravarti and Bhaktivinoda, Tripurari Maharaja clarifies 
              Bhaktisiddhanta's distinction between immature desire and the mature 
              eagerness that develops from genuine spiritual progress. Such mature 
              desire for perfection, he says, arises naturally from the positive 
              attachment to Krsna based on freedom from material desire, as described 
              by Rupa Goswami. Thus, as Tripurari Maharaja points out, 'Bhaktisiddhanta 
              <i>appears</i> to have rejected <i>siddha-pranali-diksa,</i> while 
              in reality he rejected its misappropriation' [emphasis added]. Indeed, 
              Maharaja appends a short lecture in which Bhaktisiddhanta tells 
              his disciples, 'Do not think that <i>astakaliya-lila smarana</i> 
              is the property of the <i>sahajiyas</i>. Actually it is our affair. 
              It has to be retrieved from the hands of the <i>sahajiyas</i>.'</p>
            <p>Maharaja explains that Bhaktisiddhanta's approach to <i>raganuga-bhakti</i> 
              stresses <i>kirtana</i>, enhanced by chanting the traditional Gaudiya-Vaisnava-mantras, 
              more than <i>smaranam</i>. Moreover, he broadened the understanding 
              of <i>kirtana</i> to include practical activities for disseminating 
              Lord Caitanya's teachings, especially the production and distribution 
              of transcendental literature. Swami Tripurari cites many sources 
              asserting the pre-eminence of <i>kirtana</i>, including <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 
              and <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. Bhaktisiddhanta's approach was 
              somewhat innovative; however, Maharaja demonstrates its roots in 
              tradition predating the <i>siddha-pranali </i>system. The chanting 
              of the holy name is the prime purificatory activity for Kali-yuga 
              and is accessible to all without any discrimination. This system, 
              Tripurari Maharaja writes, neither ignores nor prematurely imitates 
              the esoteric practices of <i>raganuga-bhakti</i>; rather, it prepares 
              the practitioners by purifying their hearts, ensuring gradual progress, 
              from initial <i>sraddha</i> through the <i>anartha-nivrtti</i> stage, 
              so the <i>sadhakas </i>may realise their spiritual identity in truth 
              rather than in imagination.</p>
            <p>This booklet also explores the nature of the <i>sampradaya</i> 
              as conceived by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. In response to the degeneration 
              of many venerable lines of succession, Bhaktivinoda, and, following 
              his explicit instruction, Bhaktisiddhanta, sought to reform the 
              Gaudiya Vaisnava-sampradaya by stressing the substance over apparent 
              form. Therefore, in pursuance of this end, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 
              fashioned such an essential lineage, consisting of universally acknowledged 
              <i>maha-bhagavatas</i>, thus making the important teachings of the 
              most prominent lines accessible to all sincere devotees. This essential 
              <i>sampradaya</i> may be called a <i>bhagavata-</i> or <i>siksa-sampradaya</i>. 
              The outward form is less important than essential spiritual ideal, 
              the Swami explains. Such is the nature of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's 
              revolution.</p>
            <p>What is the significance of all this to ISKCON devotees? Tripurari 
              Maharaja has written this booklet to encourage all devotees, including 
              those in ISKCON, to understand the nature of their spiritual heritage. 
              It often seems that ISKCON's focus on A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, 
              its Founder/<i>acarya,</i> has isolated ISKCON and its leaders from 
              the rest of the spiritual family that Maharaja calls the 'Bhaktivinoda-parivara'.<i> 
              </i>This isolation, together with Srila Prabhupada's caution regarding 
              the particulars of cultivating spontaneous devotion, Maharaja suggests, 
              has limited the society's impact and perhaps stunted the growth 
              of its members' devotional creepers. Following Srila Prabhupada 
              and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta, ISKCON's leaders teach that following 
              the process of <i>vaidhi-sadhana-bhakti</i> and vigorously preaching 
              Krsna consciousness will automatically deliver the practitioner 
              to the goal. Tripurari Maharaja wants to remind them that that goal 
              is to develop an inner desire for Vraja-bhakti. This desire, he 
              says, 'is the spiritual heritage of ISKCON'. ISKCON's leaders, then, 
              should ensure that service to the movement actually yields such 
              desires; further, they should be prepared to help devotees cultivate 
              those desires as they mature. More than this, though, Maharaja suggests 
              that an honest connection with the rest of Bhaktivinoda's family 
              and an increased focus on the essential mission in all its forms 
              would enhance ISKCON's potency. </p>
            <p>Many ISKCON leaders may tend to resist this advice. They will see 
              Tripurari Maharaja as an 'outsider' whose stress on 'substance' 
              over 'form' is code for neglecting the institution Srila Prabhupada 
              worked so hard to establish and exhorted his disciples to maintain. 
              However, this article itself provides evidence that such suspicions 
              may be mistaken. The booklet's tone indicates that Maharaja wrote 
              it in a mood of service to ISKCON and the other preaching missions 
              following Bhaktisiddhanta. Its purpose appears not to criticise 
              any institution, but to critique it with an eye to extending the 
              principle of 'unity in diversity' among all preaching missions. 
              The author advocates revival, not rejection.</p>
            <p>It may be that the author's tone is as significant as the essay's 
              subject. Tripurari Maharaja's essay may be an example of what communication 
              scholars have come to call 'invitational argument'. Such a rhetorical 
              approach is concerned less with dominance than with inviting interlocutors 
              into a conversation based on mutual regard and exploration. This 
              may be a model of dialogue more appropriate for discussions among 
              devotees than the more antagonistic response to controversies arising 
              in the movement over the past few years. Maharaja points out that 
              his essay is somewhat exploratory, meant more to open discussion 
              than to close it down. In his introduction he writes, 'I offer this 
              article as food for thought and with openness to information that 
              I may not be aware of that might alter its conclusions... .' Scholars 
              who read <i>Sri Guru-prampara</i> will apprehend more clearly the 
              dynamic nature of the Krsna consciousness movement. Leaders and 
              preachers within the movement who read this booklet &#151; including 
              those in ISKCON &#151; may be better prepared to defend the <i>sampradaya</i> 
              they serve when asked about apparent deviations from Gaudiya traditions 
              or apparent gaps in the lineage. If those who accept Tripurari Maharaja's 
              invitation also examine its manner of presentation, they may benefit 
              from both its substance and its form.</p>
