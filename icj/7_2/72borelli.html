            <p><b>The value of a statement of purpose</b></p>

            <p>A statement of mission is a valuable document. To accompany their 

              many gestures of goodwill in the arena of interreligious relations, 

              ISKCON members can now present to their partners in dialogue the 

              document, 'ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in God'. Those 

              of us who meet ISKCON members in our work, ministry and everyday 

              lives are grateful to Saunaka Rsi Dasa, the ISKCON Interfaith Commission 

              and the GBC Executive Committee for developing and issuing this 

              first official statement concerning the Society's relationship with 

              other people of faith in God. Readers seeking clear statements of 

              definition and purpose for ISKCON, and those members of the Society 

              engaged in interreligious relations, dialogue and co-operation, 

              will not be disappointed. The document offers reassurances of good 

              intentions and respectful actions on the part of ISKCON members 

              and presents goals similar to those of other religious groups for 

              relating to all members of society.</p>

            <p>ISKCON defines itself as a Vedantic, monotheistic Vaisnava tradition 

              and a missionary movement seeking to spread love of God. Thus, its 

              membership must grapple with the uncertain relationship between 

              mission and dialogue - a problem that Christians, Muslims and others 

              must also face. The text observes candidly: 'Some may feel that 

              for a missionary movement, a dialogue with those who may not share 

              the same spiritual or religious views may seem a contradiction in 

              purpose.' That the two seem contradictory is only part of the issue. 

              Some may feel that missionary activity overshadows any outreach 

              to peoples of other faiths. Indeed, in certain regions of the world 

              today including India, religious leaders confront Christians with 

              the suggestion that any widespread desire for interreligious dialogue 

              is nothing but a disguised programme for missionary activity. ISKCON 

              members may experience similar reactions. History, the mistakes 

              of the past, and the untrue impressions people have of our religious 

              traditions need to be addressed, and this statement is an important 

              step for ISKCON. Many Christians will feel a kindred spirit with 

              ISKCON's explanation of how bearing witness to the love of God in 

              the world implies openly and respectfully entering interreligious 

              relationships.</p>

            <p>The strength of  ISKCON's position on the relationship between 

              mission and dialogue lies in the distinction between conversion 

              as an individual experience, and spiritual development as the overall 

              purpose for all activities. Thus, on the one hand, ISKCON can say 

              that through dialogue people of different faiths can share principles 

              and address areas of common concern, engage together in the pursuit 

              of truth and encourage one another in their spiritual practices, 

              as an outgrowth of their mission; and, on the other, state that 

              its members will accept with open arms any sincere soul that declares 

              a need for their spiritual shelter and guidance, conversion being 

              part of a personal spiritual journey. Mission and dialogue appear 

              to be distinct, yet related, aspects of a single overriding purpose, 

              which ISKCON designates as spiritual development; however, these 

              explanations do not bring an end to discussion. In fact, how religious 

              communities live these distinctions between conversion and spiritual 

              development, and mission and dialogue, seems to lead to considerable 

              comment and even disputation. Our explanations may never seem completely 

              satisfying, even to ourselves, as we stumble with heavily laden 

              words such as 'proselytise' and 'conversion'. We try to flee the 

              negative connotations of expressions like 'religious institution' 

              or 'sectarian affiliation', and attempt to set ourselves apart from 

              failures and shortcomings, the exclusivist demands or narrow-mindedness 

              of other people, times or places.</p>

            <p>The reason we never quite seem to state our purpose once and for 

              all is because interreligious relations are actually the encounter 

              of peoples of faith. Religions do not dialogue; people dialogue. 

              Religions are not the partners of joint actions; people constitute 

              the relationship. Religious persons mediate to one another their 

              practices and beliefs. Every interreligious encounter takes on the 

              character of the people listening and speaking in it, and so our 

              principles, which ground our mission and witness in the world, can 

              also be expressed and heard by one another differently in each particular 

              relationship. </p>

            <p>Thus, ISKCON's statement reiterates the importance of charity, 

              non-violence, humility, compassion, respect, honesty, spiritual 

              education and personal integrity. In practising these virtues in 

              dialogue and relationship with people of other faiths, the members 

              of ISKCON are confident that they and their partners will strengthen 

              in faith, that the integrity and vision of their institutions will 

              benefit and they will be spiritually enriched, leading to a profound 

              realisation of mission. In addition, they will continue to raise 

              a challenge to those who espouse atheistic and materialistic principles 

              and values. These are insightful observations that many others have 

              concluded based on their experience of interreligious dialogue.</p>

            <p>There are certain actions that according to the statement are inappropriate 

              or unbecoming &#151; actions that do not witness the love of God 

              in the world, such as denigrating, misrepresenting or humiliating 

              members of other faith communities. The statement quotes Srila Prabhupada, 

              who urged his students not to criticise others' methods of religion. 

              By following this advice, trust and friendship have an opportunity 

              to take root so that the larger purposes of interreligious dialogue 

              can be achieved &#151; spiritual knowledge, moral thought and action, 

              devotion and service to God. As the discussion becomes more and 

              more profound, and as the friendship deepens among the partners 

              in dialogue, the opportunity for candid studies of each others' 

              methods will present itself.</p>

            <p>Christians make a distinction between ecumenism and interreligious 

              relations. Ecumenism is the widespread effort among Christians to 

              heal the divisions that exist among them. They believe that full 

              and complete unity, expressed in numerous ways and ultimately for 

              the sake of the message of the Gospel, is the will of Christ. The 

              topic of diversity is addressed in particular ways by Christians 

              in the context of their efforts to overcome disunity, restore unity, 

              and appreciate the gifts of various Christian communities.</p>

            <p>Diversity and unity have different meanings in the context of interreligious 

              relations. When ISKCON's statement says, 'Thus diversity is accepted, 

              but not to exclusion of unity', it is not suggesting the goal is 

              to merge all religions into one. That would be a misrepresentation 

              of interreligious relations, which do not mean that one must compromise 

              one's fundamental beliefs. Anyone who has engaged in interreligious 

              dialogue knows that there is no compromise nor is there a desire 

              to merge all religions into one. The unity about which ISKCON's 

              statement speaks and which ISKCON's members join others in promoting, 

              is none other than that human unity that is the basis for confidence 

              in relations. We see ourselves in one another and recognise the 

              enormous potential of every person.</p>

            <p>ISKCON is to be commended for this statement and its clarifications, 

              guidelines, purposes and other dimensions.</p>
