            <p><i>This article examines the early days of the Hare Krishna movement 
              in Hungary. It is an interesting view of the movement through the 
              eyes of the government, the media, mainstream religious groups and 
              the general public, all in a time of social and political upheaval. 
              The author also looks at the motivation and attitudes of those who 
              adopted Krishna consciousness despite open hostility towards the 
              movement by certain portions of society. The article is based on 
              surveys performed in 1995-7. It is of importance as it is one of 
              a very few such studies to emerge from Eastern Europe.</i></p>
            <p>How have the mostly new Hungarian devotees received, evaluated 
              and interpreted this new religion? Why did they choose a religion 
              apparently so alien to Christian culture? What is the impelling 
              force behind their often unexpected conversion? How deep is the 
              religious awareness of the devotees joining an unfamiliar tradition? 
              To what extent is Krishna consciousness pervading the different 
              dimensions of their lives?</p>
            <p>How are the Hungarian Krishna devotees received (evaluated and 
              interpreted) in their environment: by the people on the streets, 
              followers of other religions (in this mainly Christian country), 
              the media, the politicians and the devotees themselves? Is the cultural 
              shock caused by the completely new lifestyle, culture and knowledge 
              avoidable, or is it mitigated by the happiness and bliss of conversion 
              and enlightenment? The Vedic Krishna religion simultaneously means 
              knowledge, faith, sentiment, ceremony, lifestyle and community. 
              Through which of these gates do new devotees enter this new world? 
              In what order do they become initiated into these dimensions? I 
              undertook the task of answering these questions when I started to 
              research the world of the Hungarian Krishna devotees early in the 
              autumn of 1995. This paper only includes the first steps and first 
              partial results.</p>
            <p><b>Hare Krishna and political change in Hungary</b></p>
            <p>Krishna devotees first appeared in Hungary at the end of the 1970s, 
              but only in the second wave of the mission, in the mid 1980s, did 
              a viable community develop. Their reception in Hungary, as Zsuzsa 
              Horvath<a name="101"></a><a href="#01">[1]</a> also found it, was 
              filled with both sympathy and antipathy. Since 1989 the Community 
              of the Hungarian Krishna conscious devotees (from now on HSKCON 
              or Hare Krishnas<a name="102"></a><a href="#02">[2]</a>) is a registered 
              religion<a name="103"></a><a href="#03">[3]</a> in our country. 
              By 1993, half of the population had heard of them. </p>
            <p>In September 1991, two years after the political changes and just 
              after the second country-wide Hare Krishna Festival, Geza Nemeth, 
              a reformed minister, started an attack against the Krishnas in many 
              newspapers.<a name="104"></a><a href="#04">[4]</a> His main charges 
              were that individuals are brainwashed, split from their families, 
              have lost consciousness of being Hungarian, are treated like slaves. 
              Other charges are psychological terror, aggressive psycho-technology, 
              total control, cunningness, and perversion of personality. The president 
              of the council of the Reformed Church declared that Nemeth was not 
              an authorised representative of his church's views.</p>
            <p>One month later, with the help of two Protestant ministers<a name="105"></a><a href="#05">[5]</a> 
              he founded the Helping Friend Team, the Hungarian version of the 
              anti-cult movement. Some of the goals of the Team are 'disclosing 
              information', 'alerting the organs of criminal investigation', 'establishing 
              an authority to receive complaints against destructive cults', 'to 
              act against television and radio programmes that are propagating 
              these cults', 'to deprogramme the victims of these cults', 'to neutralise 
              the economic and political penetration that is endangering national 
              security'.<a name="106"></a><a href="#06">[6]</a> In early 1993 
              Nemeth suggested to a committee of the representatives of 36 churches 
              that they separate themselves from dangerous religious groups (he 
              named HSKCON amongst these groups), but the committee rejected the 
              suggestion. Not much later Albert Toth, reformed minister and a 
              representative of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,<a name="107"></a><a href="#07">[7]</a> 
              moved an amendment to the Committee of Human Rights of the Hungarian 
              Parliament that the four churches which represent destructive ideology 
              &#151; among them HSKCON &#151; should not get support. </p>
            <p>On March 19, the Parliament resolved that HSKCON and three other 
              religions,<a name="108"></a><a href="#08">[8]</a> being 'destructive 
              sects', would not get government support. Later that month a motion 
              was tabled which determined that to qualify as a church, there were 
              two requirements: 10,000 Hungarian members or a 100-year Hungarian 
              history. The Publicity Club collected 63,000 signatures against 
              this, and international protest was also strong. In April 1993, 
              HSKCON presented a petition signed by 140 well-known public figures 
              to the Vice-President of the Parliament. In the summer of 1993, 
              a court gave a judgement against Nemeth,<a name="109"></a><a href="#09">[9]</a> 
              and in the beginning of 1994 it rejected his appeal. In September 
              1993, Nemeth organised a conference about cults but invited only 
              those parents of 'cult-members' whom he chose to take part. He similarly 
              selected the lectures. Zsuzsa Horvath, the most noted Hungarian 
              religion sociologist studying the new religious movements and cults, 
              requested leave to speak but her request was rejected. HSKCON performed 
              a three-day-long, peaceful musical demonstration at the entrance 
              of the meetings. In March 1994, the Parliament voted for governmental 
              support of HSKCON and, by this, they withdrew the judgement of HSKCON 
              as 'destructive' and recognised its religious life and charitable 
              work.<a name="110"></a><a href="#10">[10]</a></p>
            <p>To evaluate these events is delicate because their key figure &#151; 
              G. Nemeth, who died in 1995 &#151; 'was undoubtedly a well-intentioned 
              person who had been deprived of his congregation for twenty years 
              and was working as a travelling preacher who later helped the Transylvanian 
              refugees and the neglected, drug-addicted young people.'<a name="111"></a><a href="#11">[11]</a> 
              Furthermore, this minister, who urged unity of the Christian Churches, 
              had Martin Luther King and Gandhi as his role models. Why was it 
              him who began an anti-cult campaign? Could he have done it without 
              expansive support? After the political change of regime he might 
              have felt, like others, wary of the many new values, standards and 
              traditions flowing into the country with the extended freedom. Often 
              this was spearheaded by religious and spiritual movements. It is 
              difficult for the ordinary person to distinguish between the valuable 
              and the destructive, the real and the imitation, between those things 
              that can be implanted and those that can only be hung upon us. </p>
            <p>Many people might think, with more or less reason, that as the 
              hamburger and Coca Cola have replaced the tastes of our country, 
              the new spiritual-intellectual movements may have similar effects 
              on our European, Christian and national values. Nemeth alerted the 
              troops without proper political culture, sociological knowledge 
              or psychological sense, in defence of a minority that was supposedly 
              injured: the parents left by their children joining the religious 
              movements. Besides the 'injured', but in many cases not at all perfect 
              parents, many other people were standing behind and next to Nemeth: 
              some of the ministers and the congregation of the historic churches, 
              a lot of workers from the Christian parties (among them many members 
              of Parliament), (temporarily) the majority of the mass media and 
              the majority of the uninformed public who were without a tradition 
              of tolerance.</p>
            <p>What J. G. Melton<a name="112"></a><a href="#12">[12]</a> states 
              in connection with the tragedy of the Davidian sect at Waco is true 
              for Hungary &#151; after the decay of communism a new enemy is needed 
              for the maintenance of identity. In the eyes of Nemeth and his allies 
              these enemies are the Western world (mainly the USA) and the liberalism 
              and cults that are expanding from the West to the East. They are 
              enemies because they suppress and weaken national values. As Laszlo 
              Bartus mentions in a noted liberal newspaper: 'The exaggerated summer-long 
              campaign of the Hare Krishnas played a great part in the explosion 
              of the affair of the cults. Those little religious communities which 
              demand acceptance by the society have to learn to have respect for 
              the boundaries of the majority.'<a name="113"></a><a href="#13">[13]</a></p>
            <p>'Krishna drug', 'Krishna party', 'Krishna festival', 'Krishna dinner', 
              'Krishna-village': Krishnas in the Hungarian press </p>
            <p>These typical article titles from 1991-5 describe well the Hungarian 
              reception of the Krishnas. Apart from the occasional one-lined and 
              captioned-pictures, fifty to seventy articles were published about 
              the Krishnas in over seventy printed publications. </p>
            <p>Half of the writings deal with the introduction of the Krishna 
              religion, a quarter of them are profiles of individual members; 
              six of them provide a thorough analysis. Mostly the Krishnas are 
              portrayed as items of curiosity, and the main interest is about 
              the dress-code, reincarnation, diet and sexual habits. The rest 
              of the articles deal with events, mostly (15%) with festivals and, 
              in due course, with HSKCON's food distribution programme, the conference 
              organised by Geza Nemeth, the legal case, the parliamentary decision 
              against the Krishnas, the Krishna village, the scientific conference 
              organised by the Krishnas for introducing their religion and with 
              a rock musician who became converted to the Krishna faith. </p>
            <p>Between January 1991 and September 1995, 35% of the articles were 
              published in national papers, 30% in regional and local daily papers, 
              9% in political weekly papers, 8% in entertaining weekly papers 
              and 3% in art and scientific journals. There were very few articles 
              published in youth and religious papers. In 1991, 51% of the articles 
              made no value-judgement, but were mainly concerned with facts, 39% 
              portrayed the Krishnas negatively and 11% in a positive light. In 
              the next year the number of neutral articles grew to 66%, with the 
              number of negative ones decreasing to 20%. In 1992, the number of 
              articles dealing with curiosity increased from 9% to 21% (in other 
              words, they took the place of the negative articles). By 1993, the 
              number of negative articles had further decreased (to 9%) and the 
              number favourable to the Krishnas had increased three times as compared 
              to 1991. This is the year of the marked change, for the majority 
              (82%) of the articles published in the next two years were neutral 
              or objective. I estimate that at least 40% of the positive articles 
              were written or inspired by Krishnas or their friends. 40% were 
              published in left-wing papers and in the yellow press, 10% in right-wing 
              and Christian-democratic papers that in 1991 had published negative 
              articles. From 1992 there was an increase in articles that reported 
              Krishna events having titles such as: 'Peace be with you', 'Meeting 
              with the attractive superior being', 'Purifying the heart', 'Krishna's 
              charitable children', 'Krishna village &#151; opened to the world', 
              'Cart festival in the sign of tolerance'.</p>
            <p>Ten prominent publicists wrote a dozen articles about the Krishnas. 
              Eight of them wrote positively. Beside Nemeth, a dozen distinguished 
              public figures (scientists, politicians, artists, priests) expressed 
              their opinion. Seven of them were positive, three neutral and two 
              negative. </p>
            <p>What was the cause of this quick change in perception? Was it due 
              to the publicity about democracy? If so, does that mean that Hungary 
              is finally part of Europe? The answer is yes &#151; partially. Freedom 
              of religion (and the 'cults') is one of the tests of democracy. 
              Few newspapers &#151; after early uncertainty &#151; failed this 
              test.</p>
            <p>Is it possible that we have to seek the explanation mostly in the 
              socialist- and liberalist-orientated press? There may be some truth 
              in this, but the fact that by 1992-3 the right wing and the Christian-democratic 
              orientated press also seemed to be positive contradicts this. The 
              Krishnas' more conscientious and skilful public-relation activity 
              could have played a role in it. The other similarly important factor 
              could be that the yellow papers quickly gave up their negative tone 
              and focused more on curiosity since in the case of the exotic Krishnas 
              the news itself or the simple description proved to be interesting, 
              at least in the first years. </p>
            <p>The early attacks brought grist to the Krishnas' mill, and public 
              opinion about them changed very much. From being a public enemy, 
              suspicious different people, a threat, they became seen as 'strange' 
              and 'exotic', or a society not only worth smiling at or wondering 
              at, but also worth respect. They are now depicted less and less 
              as a cult and more often as an ancient, interesting culture that 
              while difficult to fully understand and approach is still worth 
              trying out. </p>

              paper of the reformed church.<a name="114"></a><a href="#14">[14]</a> 
              In a popular Catholic paper, a 'scholarly' monk writes about the 
              Krishnas in the series: <i>Web of Satan</i>. He turns Christ, the 
              redeemer who nevertheless behaved naturally, against the 'pretentious 
              godhead' of Krishna consciousness. He says that Krishna consciousness 
              is inspired by Satan, since Krishna not only forbids meat-eating 
              for his followers but is also depicted as making love with his consort.<a name="115"></a><a href="#15">[15]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>After the parliamentary decision which labelled the Krishnas as 
              destructive, Zoltan Endreffy established that the basis of this 
              suggestion is distrust, which is contradictory to the spirit of 
              the Second Vatican Synod. Tamas Majsai, a reformed minister and 
              newspaper editor, holds: 'The big churches are enjoying hugely the 
              field that was expanded for them from 1989-90 and they are <i>afraid 
              </i>of the soul-fishing of the legalised little churches.'<a name="116"></a><a href="#16">[16]</a> 
              There may be some truth in this, but there are broader issues. Bela 
              Balas, a Catholic bishop and legendary figure of movements persecuted 
              by the party government regime, thinks that the secularised world 
              creates a market for the Krishnas since there is need in society 
              for silent-thinking, self-control and higher meaning. The endeavours 
              of the Catholics and the Krishnas are, in one sense, in competition 
              in this regard. Though Bela Balas thinks that the Krishnas' 'way 
              of life is too strict and hard for the Hungarian nation with its 
              hurt soul'. At last he establishes, 'It would need incredible patience 
              for the Catholics and the Hare Krishnas to understand each other 
              and become closer'.<a name="117"></a><a href="#17">[17]</a> His 
              opinion is significant because the developing Krishna village community 
              is in his diocese. </p>
            <p>Tamas Barabas (Trisa-hara Dasa), a leader of HSKCON, prepared a 
              report at my request. He was in charge of approaching leading figures 
              in the fields of theology, churches and monastic orders after the 
              unfavourable parliamentary decision, asking for their support in 
              protesting against discrimination. His experiences of the Catholic 
              Church are typical and similar to my own. The majority of the theologians 
              did not attend the meetings. Amongst seven bishops, one was prepared 
              to sign that he found the attack against the Krishnas contrary to 
              'Christian ethics'. Many showed warm sympathy and maintained relations 
              with the Krishnas while others showed polite or sincere interest. 
              Two of the five monastic orders signed, though one of them perhaps 
              only because they are very much afraid of the victory of the socialist 
              party. In the monasteries the Krishna monk asking for help was accepted 
              as a partner, colleague or brother and they managed to talk extensively. 
              An Adventist leader and a Lutheran bishop also signed, and the rector 
              of a Protestant academy offered to welcome Krishna students into 
              his institute. </p>
            <p><b>'In the drumfire of false doctrines': Krishna consciousness 
              in the mirror of scientific and educational books</b></p>
            <p>There are half a dozen Hungarian books dealing with cults and new 
              religious movements. In most cases they misinform the reader. A 
              slender brochure was published by the Society for Scientific Education, 
              heralding the appearance of the Documentation and Information Centre 
              for protection against dangerous cults.<a name="118"></a><a href="#18">[18]</a> 
              This Centre was strongly influenced by Nemeth. According to their 
              brochure, the Krishna religion is a pseudo-science and mass-brainwashing. 
              The majority of the facts and figures are wrong, and the attitude 
              is prejudiced. There are other publications from churches. Amongst 
              those produced by the Catholics is a book by G. De Rosa, using key 
              phrases such as 'magic', 'brainwashing' and 'dictatorship'.<a name="119"></a><a href="#19">[19]</a> 
              A Hungarian author describes Krishna consciousness as part of the 
              New Age movement, an 'aggressive and destructive cult'. He compares 
              its stance on family and children to the communist and Hitlerian 
              educational principles.<a name="120"></a><a href="#20">[20]</a> 
              There is another book by a scholarly Benedictine who is critical 
              of his own church and quite tolerant of the 'cults'. He deals with 
              the Krishna religion by comparing it to other religious phenomena 
              that are not yet present in Hungary.<a name="121"></a><a href="#21">[21]</a> 
              Among two books produced by the Protestants, one is a short brochure 
              that says that non-Christian cults and movements are 'traps' and 
              our fellow-countrymen<a name="122"></a><a href="#22">[22]</a> should 
              be most definitely warned against them. The other is a larger, more 
              thorough work, and its author must have conducted his studies in 
              America. He reports quite accurately the conference organised by 
              the Krishnas to introduce their religion (although he chose not 
              to attend it but only received its publicity material). He tries 
              to refute the statements of István Tasi<i>,</i> the Hungarian writer 
              of a book that compares Christianity and Krishna consciousness.<a name="123"></a><a href="#23">[23]</a></p>
            <p>I suggest that even someone who reads the yellow press is more 
              informed about the Krishna religion than people who read those books. 
              The more demanding readers, the interested intellectuals or the 
              concerned relatives cannot really get complete and accurate information 
              because the majority of the books published in Hungarian are written 
              in a spirit of 'defence against an imagined enemy'.</p>
            <p><b>'I received an answer for everything': meeting with Krishna 
              consciousness</b></p>
            <p>Through surveys, personal talks and interviews, I have learnt about 
              the conversion, integration and transformation of the way of life 
              of one hundred Krishna followers.<a name="124"></a><a href="#24">[24]</a> 
              They represent one-tenth of the inner circle (estimated to number 
              900-1000 according HSKCON's leaders). This includes initiated monks, 
              student-members aspiring for initiation, and all those who practise 
              the religion seriously.<a name="125"></a><a href="#25">[25]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>The majority (70%) of those who completed the survey are from 21-30 
              years old. The proportion of men and women was about equal. Most 
              members had completed at least secondary education. Half of them 
              had been to specialised secondary schools or secondary grammar schools. 
              One-tenth had some university education. 30% had undertaken vocational 
              training<a name="126"></a><a href="#26">[26]</a>. Many discontinued 
              their studies because of their conversion. The majority are from 
              urban backgrounds, twice as many from other cities as from the capital. 
              On this basis, Zsuzsa Horvath's statements about the members of 
              the faith seems true:<a name="127"></a><a href="#27">[27]</a> 'They 
              mostly recruit amongst those who have enough free time for taking 
              part actively and those less socially integrated or in temporary, 
              marginal positions. In other words, they recruit amongst those for 
              whom it is relatively less risky to join a magical movement.'<a name="128"></a><a href="#28">[28]</a></p>
            <p>It is remarkable that most (65%) of the Krishnas whom I interviewed 
              had not belonged to any church or religious group before their conversion. 
              Some called themselves materialists and atheists. Others described 
              themselves as believers in some higher power, and many had been 
              familiar with the idea of reincarnation. The rest belonged mostly 
              to the Catholic Church and, to a lesser degree, to the reformed 
              church, but most of them were religious only in their childhood 
              or only superficially, without active practice, real spiritual experience 
              or deep religious values. </p>
            <p>In 1995, two-thirds of the members had committed themselves to 
              Krishna consciousness within the previous 4-7 years; the remainder 
              within the previous 1-3 years. The majority were introduced to Krishna 
              consciousness through receiving a book, others by attending public 
              programmes at the temple or at festivals, generally having been 
              invited by friends. Initially most of them found that the most attractive 
              thing about Krishna consciousness was the behaviour and attitude 
              (mainly the kindness and purity) of the Krishna followers (40%) 
              and the Vedic philosophy (30%). The hardest things for most of them 
              to come to terms with were the renunciation of sense gratification 
              and the esoteric aspects of the philosophy (for example, Krsna's 
              incarnations, the Sanskrit language, the habits (mainly the way 
              of dressing) and the Vedic roles of men and women. </p>
            <p>Initially many members' families (55%) reacted negatively to the 
              conversion, 15% positively and the others with worry, as one would 
              expect, or they found it strange or surprising. Subsequently, however, 
              most became favourably inclined.</p>
            <p>To find out about the changes in members' attitudes, convictions 
              and values, and whether Krishna consciousness is just a stage in 
              a person's search needs a more thorough research (including a study 
              of those who leave the Krishna church). One fact, however, is unambiguous: 
              there is no sign of brainwashing or some tricky forcing. Those who 
              converted cannot be described as suffering from some deficiency 
              or crisis, such as feeling life void and useless, a lack of self-confidence, 
              anguish, an unsuccessful marriage, or fear of death. On the contrary, 
              members generally showed positive characteristics, such as interests 
              in Vedic and Indian culture, vegetarianism, yoga, mysticism, transcendence 
              and reincarnation.</p>
            <p><b> Living in Krishna consciousness in the world</b></p>
            <p>I asked the question: 'What does Krishna consciousness mean for 
              you?' The most frequent answers were: way of life (70%); knowledge 
              (65%); faith (55%); security and community (40%). Only 15-35% chose 
              enlightenment, certainty, mission and ritual. Notably, 40% found 
              that Krishna consciousness represented the goal or meaning of life. 
            </p>
            <p>Naturally, we have to take into account that new followers portray 
              their lives prior their conversion negatively (willingly or not), 
              and they explain it through their new worldview. In this way they 
              attempt to suppress the old way of life and justify the present 
              one. Perhaps this explains why Krishna followers feel that Krishna 
              consciousness has changed their life radically. Mostly they describe 
              these changes as follows: their human relationships have become 
              happier and more harmonised; they have found the goal of life and 
              have become more spiritual. One-third changed their social status 
              (they shifted from work of an intellectual nature to physical work, 
              mundane studies to studies in the monastery). Most of them feel 
              that their personality changed; becoming more open, sincere, patient, 
              balanced, peaceful and determined. In spite of their living at a 
              greater distance from their families (because they moved to the 
              temple), they reported that their relationships with the members 
              of their family had improved.</p>
            <p>Members' interests have become simultaneously narrower and broader. 
              Members are broader in their interests about the inner and transcendent 
              world, but they are less interested in the events, institutions, 
              entertainment, science and art of the mundane (they say 'material' 
              or 'sensual') world. Most of them are not (60%) or hardly (20%) 
              interested in politics, and they have the same attitude towards 
              non-Vedic sciences that they consider atheistic, faithless, unnecessary 
              and imperfect. Members regard the following as entertainment: associating 
              with devotees (20%), reading, music and talking (15%), singing, 
              festivals, <i>kirtanas</i>, reading the scriptures, hearing scriptural 
              classes, accepting sanctified food, and dancing (5-15%). One-third 
              of them do not read anything but scripture, only one-third read 
              newspapers, 5-15% read educational books (e.g. natural healing, 
              esoteric literature, training of children) and also fiction. For 
              more than a year, two-thirds of them have not been to the theatre, 
              four- fifths have not been to the cinema, and 45% have not watched 
              television (and for those who have it is mostly news or wildlife 
              or documentaries). </p>
            <p>I have studied their scale of values using the Rokeach-test. This 
              test lists eighteen goals and eighteen values. I had the opportunity 
              to compare the Krishnas' results with (same aged but a little more 
              educated) members of the Catholic community whose religion and level 
              of commitment is most close to theirs. The 6-6 values that most 
              of them chose or rejected were the following:</p>

            <p>The similarity is conspicuous: In both scales of values the spiritual 
              values are prominent. The difference, however, is also sharp; in 
              the life of the deeply Catholic people, human relationships and 
              feelings are much more important, in the case of the Krishnas the 
              emphasis is on transformation of the ego or, as they say, the 'devotion'. 
            </p>
            <p><b> Summary</b></p>
            <p>Was it incidental that the growth of HSKCON happened at a time 
              of political change, or was it due to this social upheaval that 
              peoples' interest in something promising peace and a sense of meaning 
              was awakened?</p>
            <p>Even at the beginning of the study we see that the Krishnas get 
              in connection with a culture which is more or less unfamiliar, but 
              its many elements enchant them, although the conscious acceptance 
              and realisation of values supposedly happens only slowly. The everyday 
              thinking and the way of life of the Krishnas are strongly penetrated 
              by their faith. </p>
            <p>It is difficult to decide whether the world of the new Krishna 
              followers has become narrower or broader. It needs more research 
              to clarify whether the habits, standards and  values of the mundane 
              world are completely rejected or if they are merely readjusted and
