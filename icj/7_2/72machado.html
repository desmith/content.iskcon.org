            <p>Ven. Saunaka Rsi Dasa, Director of the Oxford Centre for Vaisnava 
              and Hindu Studies, has published a document, 'ISKCON in Relation 
              to People of Faith in God', inviting people from various religious 
              traditions to respond to it. Representing the Catholic Tradition 
              and committed to promoting respectful and friendly relations with 
              people of different faiths, I wish to share how the Catholic Church 
              understands its dialogue with other religious traditions. I would 
              like to state here that although the Catholic Church considers its 
              relations with various Hindu religious traditions an important aspect 
              of her mission it has, so far, not entered into any direct, formal 
              dialogue with ISKCON. In recent years, several ISKCON members have 
              made sporadic visits to the PCID (Pontifical Council for Interreligious 
              Dialogue) and the staff have always received them in a friendly 
              spirit. The result of these informal but friendly meetings has been 
              positive.</p>
            <p>I am struck by the title of the document, namely, <i>ISKCON in 
              Relation to People of Faith</i> <i>in God</i>. The first point in 
              Part 1 of the document clearly states that ISKCON considers love 
              of a supreme personal God to be the highest form of religious expression, 
              and recognises and respects this expression in other theistic traditions:</p>
            <p>In ISKCON we consider love of a Supreme personal God to be the 
              highest form of religious expression, and we recognise and respect 
              this expression in other theistic traditions. We respect the spiritual 
              worth of paths of genuine self-realisation and search for the Absolute 
              Truth in which the concept of a personal Deity is not explicit. 
              Other communities and organisations advocating humanitarian, ethical 
              and moral standards are also valued as being beneficial to society. 
              (Part 1, 1)</p>
            <p>Christianity is essentially a religion founded on faith in God. 
              The divine mystery, fully re-vealed in the person of Jesus Christ, 
              is central to the Christian faith. The Church, which is also part 
              of that divine revelation, continues, like a sacrament, to communicate 
              this revelation in history. Consequently, because of their search 
              for the divine mystery, religious traditions, particularly those 
              that explicitly acknowledge his existence, hold a special place 
              in the Church's relations. In this context I would like to quote 
              St. Paul's dialogue with a group of people belonging to another 
              religious tradition that acknowledged existence of God. Paul said: 
              'Men of Athens, I have seen for myself how extremely scrupulous 
              you are in all religious matters, because, as I strolled round looking 
              at your sacred monuments, I noticed among other things an altar 
              inscribed: To An Unknown God. In fact, the unknown God you revere 
              is the one I proclaim to you.'</p>
            <p>Since the God who made the world and everything in it is Himself 
              Lord of heaven and earth, He does not make His home in shrines made 
              by human hands. Nor is He in need of anything, that He should be 
              served by human hands; on the contrary, it is He who gives everything 
              &#151; including life and breath &#151; to everyone. From one single 
              principle He not only created the whole human race so that they 
              could occupy the entire earth, but He decreed the times and limits 
              of their habitation. He did this so that they might seek the deity 
              and, by feeling their way towards Him, succeed in finding Him. Indeed, 
              He is not far from any of us, since it is in Him that we live and 
              move and exist. As some of your own writers have said: We are all 
              His children. </p>
            <p>Since we are the children of God, we have no excuse for thinking 
              that the deity looks like anything in gold, silver or stone that 
              has been carved and designed by man. (Acts of the Apostles, 17:23-9, 
              <i>The New Jerusalem Bible</i>)</p>
            <p>Through its document, <i>Nostra Aetate</i>, the Catholic Church 
              launched an official call 'in our times' to all its faithful to 
              enter into positive relations with people of different religions. 
              It was promulgated in Rome in 1962-5, during the Second Vatican 
              Council, a decisive and major event in the life of the Church, as 
              an official teaching concerning relations with other religions. 
              <i>Nostra Aetate</i> makes the search for and belief in the existence 
              of God by people of different religious traditions as the principal 
              motive for the Church's dialogue with them: </p>
            <p>Throughout history even to the present day there is found among 
              different peoples a certain awareness of a hidden power, which lies 
              behind the course of nature and the events of human life. At times 
              there is present even a recognition of a supreme being, or still 
              more of a Father. Such an awareness and such a recognition instil 
              the lives of these peoples with a profound religious sense. Religions 
              bound up with cultural advancement have struggled to reply to these 
              same questions with more refined concepts and in more highly developed 
              language.</p>
            <p>Thus in Hinduism men contemplate the divine mystery and express 
              it through an unspent fruitfulness of myths and through searching 
              philosophical inquiry. They seek release from the anguish of our 
              condition, through ascetical practices or deep meditation or a loving, 
              trusting flight toward God. (<i>NA,</i> 2)</p>
            <p>However, I wish to make it clear that ' ... belief in (God) is 
              the easiest and, at the same time, the most difficult starting point 
              in Hindu-Christian dialogue. It is the easiest starting point because 
              Hinduism is saturated with a rich and profound reflection on the 
              existence, nature and the presence of God; Hinduism speaks of the 
              practice to reach God in innumerable ways. But the question of God 
              is also the most difficult starting point for dialogue with Hinduism 
              because of its ambivalent, syncretistic and absorbing nature.' (F. 
              Machado, <i>Pro Dialogo</i>, 93, 1996/3)</p>
            <p>The second point in Part 1 of the ISKCON document speaks about 
              a basic principle which is important in the dynamics of interreligious 
              dialogue; namely, a certain openness towards the dialogue partner 
              while at the same time the obligation to uncompromisingly hold on 
              to one's own essential religious identity and respect that of the 
              other:</p>
            <p>ISKCON views dialogue between its members and people of other faiths 
              as an opportunity to listen to others, to develop mutual understanding 
              and mutual trust, and to share our commitment and faith with others, 
              while respecting their commitment to their own faith. (Part 1, 2)</p>
            <p>Part 2 of the ISKCON document speaks about this when it states 
              that:</p>
            <p> ... diversity is accepted, but not to the exclusion of unity. 
              Religions do not have to become homogenous or merge together, but 
              they can develop respectful and practical relationships with one 
              another.</p>
            <p>The same document further states:</p>
            <p>... we need to encourage one another to be faithful to the principles 
              of our own traditions.</p>
            <p>In its commitment to and practice of interreligious dialogue, the 
              Church has considered, on the one hand, adherence to one's own religious 
              identity and, on the other hand, a trustful openness to other religious 
              traditions, as two important elements. To be rooted in one's own 
              faith means, first of all, an uncompromising obedience to God as 
              believed in faithfulness to one's own religious tradition. It means 
              to be familiar with the essential precepts, doctrines, teachings, 
              duties, etc. of one's own religious tradition. It also means to 
              be committed to the duties and responsibilities that are consequences 
              of belonging to a particular religious tradition. In short, it means 
              to enter into dialogue with the integrity of his or her own faith. 
              Dialogue begins, grows authentically and bears fruits, despite difficulties, 
              when it stands on the solid foundation of mutual trust between partners. 
              If fear of the other is the enemy of dialogue then lack of trust 
              should be said to be at the root of fear. Trust inspires and cultivates 
              eagerness to know the other, not superficially but in depth; trust 
              helps overcome fear of hurting the other.</p>
            <p>This obligation, with a double dimension concerning interreligious 
              dialogue, is beautifully expressed in one of the documents from 
              the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, which states:</p>
            <p>That they may be able to give this witness to Christ fruitfully, 
              (Christians) ought to be joined to the people of their time by esteem 
              and love, and acknowledge themselves to be members of the group 
              of people among whom they live ... . They ought to know well the 
              religious and cultural traditions of others, happy to discover and 
              ready to respect the seeds of the Word which are hidden in them 
              ... . As Christ himself ... so also His disciples should know the 
              people among whom they live and should establish contact with them, 
              to learn by patient and sincere dialogue what treasurers a bountiful 
              God has distributed among the nations of the earth. At the same 
              time, let them try to illuminate these treasurers with their Saviour. 
              (<i>The</i> <i>Attitude of the Church Towards the Followers of Other 
              Religions</i>, Vatican, 1984, n. 27)</p>
            <p>The third point of Part 1 of the ISKCON document merits careful 
              response on the part of the Catholic Church:</p>
            <p>ISKCON recognises that no one religion holds a monopoly on the 
              truth, the revelation of God or our relationship with God. (Part 
              1, 3)</p>
            <p>The Catholic Church firmly believes that, created in the 'image 
              of God', human beings have the possibility of knowing God. Only 
              in God will they find the truth and happiness they never stop searching 
              for. The Catholic Church further holds that in many ways, throughout 
              history down to the present day, human beings have given expression 
              to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behaviour: 
              in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations and so forth. 
              However, the Catholic Church's self-understanding is also formed 
              by her unshakeable faith that there is another order of knowing 
              God, which one cannot possibly arrive at by one's own powers: the 
              order of divine revelation. Through an utterly free decision, God 
              has fully revealed Himself and given Himself to mankind by sending 
              us His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and by giving the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>However, the Church considers dialogue with other religions indispensable 
              because the Catholic Church acknowledges that the fullness of truth 
              received in Jesus Christ does not give individual Christians the 
              guarantee that they have grasped the truth fully. The Church admonishes 
              the Catholic faithful to remain open to truth:</p>
            <p>In the last analysis truth is not a thing we possess, but a person 
              by whom we must allow ourselves to be possessed. This is an unending 
              process. While keeping their identity intact, Christians must be 
              prepared to learn and to receive from and through others the positive 
              values of their traditions ... . Through dialogue they (must allow) 
              the understanding of their own faith to be purified. ('Dialogue 
              and Proclamation, Reflections and Orientations on Interreligious 
              Dialogue and the Proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ', <i>P.C.I.D. 
              Bulletin</i>, 77, 1991) </p>
            <p>Christian understanding of the truth, which is defined as the revelation 
              of God in Jesus Christ, must not become an occasion for Christians 
              to be self-complacent, righteous and judgemental of others. The 
              official teaching of the Catholic Church states:</p>
            <p>Truth, however, is to be sought in a manner proper to the dignity 
              of the human person and his social nature. The inquiry is to be 
              free, carried on with the aid of teaching or instruction, communication 
              and dialogue. In the course of these, men explain to one another 
              the truth they have discovered or claim to have discovered in order 
              to help one another in their search for the truth. Moreover, as 
              truth is discovered, it is by personal assent that men are to adhere 
              to it. (The Second Vatican Council, <i>Dignitatis Humanae</i>, n. 
              4)</p>
            <p>The Catholic Church proposes different forms of dialogue so that 
              all may have the possibility of promoting it according to his or 
              her ability. Among these forms, dialogue of collaboration is mentioned. 
              This corresponds to the fourth point of Part 1 of the ISKCON document:</p>
            <p>ISKCON's members are encouraged to be respectful to people of faith 
              from other traditions and to see the need for people of different 
              faiths to work together for the benefit of society as a whole and 
              for the glorification of God. (Part 1, 4)</p>
            <p>Catholics are encouraged to work with people of different religious 
              traditions to confront together the problems of the world and for 
              goals of a humanitarian, social, economic, or political nature which 
              are directed towards the liberation and advancement of mankind. 
              The most outstanding and concrete example of this form of dialogue 
              is found in the coming together of different religious leaders in 
              Assisi in 1986, at the invitation of Pope John Paul II, to pray 
              for peace in the world. The clarion call in the 1950s of the founder 
              of ISKCON to the leaders of various religions, in the midst of the 
              growing indifference to the religious nature of the human person, 
              not to sit idly and silently watch the rapid growth of a Godless 
              civilisation, merits our serious consideration.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the points of convergence between different religions, 
              it must also be said that religions also essentially differ in their 
              fundamental beliefs, doctrines and manner of living. Consequently, 
              there are different ways of understanding the divine mystery, distinct 
              ways of approaching it, characteristic ways of conceiving and expressing 
              beliefs, definite ways of responding to moral and ethical questions, 
              etc. These questions need to be reflected upon by experts and specialists. 
              Yet, in the pluralistic world of today, all believers face the same 
              existential problems. Thus dialogue of collaboration becomes a necessity. 
              The Catholic Church encourages its faithful throughout the world 
              to seek collaboration among various religions to address such problems 
              as war, violence, moral decline, crime, intoxication, poverty and 
              hunger, social instability and environmental degradation.</p>
            <p>In the fifth point in Part 4 of the document, ISKCON proposes that 
              each individual develop his or her relationship with the Supreme 
              Lord:</p>
            <p>ISKCON affirms the responsibility of each individual to develop 
              his or her relationship with the Supreme Lord. (Part 4, 5)</p>
            <p>According to the Christian tradition, God reveals Himself as the 
              Father of all in His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. As the third 
              person of the Blessed Trinity, the mystery of divine love, the Holy 
              Spirit, inspires and enables each individual to relate to God the 
              Father by associating in a mysterious way through the passion, death 
              and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Thus, every individual has the 
              possibility of accepting this relationship with God, the Supreme 
              Lord. What is to be emphasised here is the characteristic of the 
              Christian faith, namely, it is not so much the initiative of the 
              human person to develop a personal relationship with the Supreme 
              Lord as simply to go on accepting, through an act of faith, the 
              initiative of God in the course of his or her life. Of course, far 
              from being inert, uninvolved and passive, every person is called 
              to responsibly inculcate this relationship through God's grace, 
              which is constant and unfailing.</p>
            <p>But there is another dimension to this relationship, namely that 
              love of God cannot be separated from the love of one's neighbour. 
              According to the Christian tradition they go together inseparably 
              like two wings of a bird. One grows simultaneously in one's relationship 
              with God and one's neighbour. In other words, the whole of religious 
              experience cannot be reduced to just a personal relationship between 
              an individual and the Supreme Lord. One cannot claim to love God 
              while hating his brother or sister. This is why <i>caritas</i> or 
              <i>agape</i> (unselfish love) has been the constitutive dimension 
              of the Christian faith. Commitment to bring, not just better life, 
              but fullness of life, to every person, particularly the poor and 
              the downtrodden, is an intrinsic part of the <i>sadhana </i>for 
              growing into a personal relationship with the Supreme Lord.</p>
            <p>We find the essence of this Christian teaching in the first letter 
              of St. John. He says:</p>
            <p>My dear friends, let us love one another, since love is from God 
              and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. Whoever 
              fails to love does not know God, because God is love. This is the 
              revelation of God's love for us, that God sent His only Son into 
              the world that we might have life through Him. Love consists in 
              this: it is not we who loved God, but God loved and sent His Son 
              to expiate our sins ... . Let us love, then, because He first loved 
              us. (<i>The First Letter of John</i>, 4:7-10, 19)</p>
            <p>For Christians, dialogue means all positive and constructive interreligious 
              relations with individuals and communities of other faiths. Enterprise 
              of dialogue must be carried out in obedience to truth and respect 
              for freedom. Through their dialogue with other religious tra-ditions 
              and their adherents, Christians wish to understand themselves better, 
              to get to know others justly and fairly, to dispel fears and misunderstandings, 
              to be influenced, inspired and enriched mutually with their partners 
              in dialogue and to accept the new self-understanding which may emerge 
              as a consequence of dialogue. For Christians, dialogue is a sacred 
              act be-cause 'by dialogue we let God be present in our midst; for 
              as we open ourselves in dialogue to one another, we also open ourselves 
              to God.' (Pope John Paul II, Madras, 1986) Respect, tolerance, mutual 
              understanding, good behaviour, etc., form part of one's spirituality 
              of dialogue. The guidelines for approaching members of other faiths 
              in the ISKCON document are a fine summary of what the Catholic tradition 
              has been proposing and communicating through the official teaching 
              of the Church (through the Pope and the Bishops) in our times.</p>
            <p>I wish to conclude by presenting some challenges that are generally 
              faced by Christians in their dialogue with Hindus. The Catholic 
              Church has high esteem for Hinduism, the family of religions in 
              which a reflection of that truth which enlightens all men is found. 
              All the traditions of Hinduism (<i>sampradayas</i>) manifest the 
              quest of the human person for the Absolute Truth. This quest instils 
              the lives of Hindus with a profound religious sense. </p>
            <p>This is what Pope John Paul II publicly declared to the Hindus: 
              'I hold in esteem your concern for inner peace and for the peace 
              of the world, based not on purely mechanistic or materialistic political 
              considerations but on self-purification, unselfish love and sympathy 
              for all.' (Address at Los Angeles, 16 September 1987)</p>
            <p>Christians need to know this complex tradition well. Hinduism as 
              such has no identity. The most appropriate approach to this tradition 
              is to know the particular <i>sampradaya</i>, such as Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              &#151; a monotheistic tradition within Hinduism. Given the well-organised 
              structure of the Catholic Church, its members wish to find a credible, 
              suitable and representative dialogue partner in Hinduism. There 
              are devout and practising individual Hindus who are not necessarily 
              part of any institution, organisation or community. It is important 
              to enter into dialogue with these rather than wait for a representative 
              of an institution or an organisation or a community. Hindus in dialogue 
              with Christians must also realise that the mys-tery of God, revealed 
              in Jesus Christ, and the living community of the Church are distinct 
              but inseparable. Of course, the Church is not merely the sum total 
              of all Christians, neither is it a purely human institution. As 
              transcendental mystery, the Church is the living 'Body of Christ' 
              (<i>The First Letter of Paul</i> <i>to the Church at Corinth</i>, 
              12:12-30). Thus every individual Christian is at the same time his 
              or her entire community. In other words, every individual's essential 
              identity is the Church.</p>
            <p>According to the particular nature of Hinduism, Jesus Christ is 
              accepted, loved and revered by most Hindus. This fact makes it easy 
              for a Christian to enter into dialogue with Hindus. However, dialogue 
              also becomes difficult and appears to have reached a dead end for 
              Christians when Jesus Christ is seen by Hindus only as one of the 
              many manifestations (<i>avataras</i>) of the Absolute Mystery; because, 
              for the Christian there is no other Saviour outside the person of 
              Jesus Christ. The Church accepts that people in other religions 
              could be saved in and through their respective religious traditions; 
              however, that salvation is never independent of Jesus Christ. The 
              Catholic Church teaches that all religions, as far as they uphold 
              truth, holiness and goodness, are related to the mystery of Jesus 
              Christ. This is why Christian theologians speak of 'participatory' 
              ways rather than 'parallel' ways of salvation, which are always 
              related to the mystery of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all.</p>
            <p>Based on the revelation of God in history, Christianity gives history 
              a paramount im-portance: </p>
            <p>Christianity has its starting-point in the incarnation of the Word. 
              Here, it is not simply a case of man seeking God, but of God who 
              comes in Person to speak to man of Himself and to show him the path 
              by which He may be reached ... . <i>The Incarnate Word is thus the 
              fulfilment of the yearning present in all the religions of mankind</i>: 
              this fulfilment is brought about by God Himself and transcends all 
              human expectations. (John Paul II, <i>Tertio Adveniente</i>, n.&nbsp;6)</p>
            <p>A Christian enters into dialogue with people of different religious 
              traditions because he or she is aware that the action of Christ 
              and his Spirit is already mysteriously present in all who live sincerely 
              according to their religious convictions.</p>
