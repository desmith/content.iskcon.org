            <p><i>This article was originally presented as a paper at the AFF 
              (American Family Foundation) Annual Conference held at St. Paul 
              Campus, University of Minnesota, on 14 May 1999 by Dr Michael D. 
              Langone, Executive Director of the AFF and editor of the Cultic 
              Studies Journal.</i></p>
            <p>This conference's title, 'Cults, Psychological Manipulation, and 
              Society: International Perspectives', is significant because cults 
              and related groups have aroused significant concern around the world. 
              I am aware of organisations concerned about cults in the following 
              countries: USA, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, 
              Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, 
              Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Greece, Russia, Malta, 
              Israel, Japan and Australia. There are probably some of which I 
              am not aware. The concern tends to focus on, though not be limited 
              to, issues related to psychological manipulation and its impact 
              on society. Concerns generate much confusion and disputation, in 
              large part because people define the term 'cult' in different ways.</p>
            <p><b>Analysis of definitional issues</b></p>
            <p>According to the <i>Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary</i> 
              (1971) the term 'cult' originally referred to 'worship; reverential 
              homage rendered to a divine being or beings ... a particular form 
              or system of religious worship, especially in reference to its external 
              rites and ceremonies ... devotion or homage to a particular person 
              or thing.'</p>
            <p>More recently, the term has taken on additional connotations: '3: 
              A religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious ... 4: A system for 
              the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator 
              ... 5: a. great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or 
              work ... b. a usually small group of people characterized by such 
              devotion" (<i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, </i>Tenth 
              Edition, 1994). Rutgers University professor, Benjamin Zablocki 
              (1997), says that sociologists often distinguish 'cult' from 'church', 
              'sect', and 'denomination'. Cults are innovative, fervent groups. 
              If they become accepted into the mainstream, cults, in his view, 
              lose their fervour and become more organised and integrated into 
              the community; they become churches. When people within churches 
              become dissatisfied and break off into fervent splinter groups, 
              the new groups are called sects. As sects become more stolid and 
              integrated into the community, they become denominations. Zablocki 
              defines a cult as 'an ideological organisation held together by 
              charismatic relationships and demanding total commitment'. According 
              to Zablocki, cults are at high risk of becoming abusive to members, 
              in part because members' adulation of charismatic leaders contributes 
              to their becoming corrupted by the power they seek and are accorded. 
              The power these corrupt &#151; or corrupted &#151; leaders come 
              to wield can also result in social harm, such as lawbreaking and 
              the undermining of democratic values. Definitions proposed at various 
              times by associates of AFF tend to presume the manifestation of 
              what is potential in Zablocki's definition (by definition, low-control 
              groups are not cultic). These definitions tend to emphasise elements 
              of authoritarian structure, deception and manipulation and the fact 
              that groups may be psychotherapeutic, political or commercial as 
              well as religious.</p>
            <p>Because such definitions imply high levels of psychological manipulation, 
              some students of the field have associated cults with the concept 
              of thought reform (Lifton, 1961; Ofshe &amp; Singer, 1986; Singer 
              &amp; Ofshe, 1990). Although there are similarities between these 
              concepts, a cult does not necessarily have to be characterised by 
              thought reform, nor does a thought reform programme necessarily 
              have to be a cult. Nevertheless, the two seem to go together often 
              enough that many people mistakenly see them as necessarily linked.</p>
            <p>Definitions advanced by AFF associates imply that the term 'cult' 
              refers to a continuum, in which a large grey area separates 'cult' 
              from 'non-cult'. This continuum is often expressed by the use of 
              qualifiers such as 'destructive' or harmless. These definitions 
              suggest that there may be some debate about the appropriateness 
              of the term as applied to a specific group, especially when available 
              evidence indicates that the group is in or near the grey area of 
              the continuum. This debate can become more acute when the group 
              in question is one that varies among its geographic locations, has 
              different levels of membership with correspondingly different levels 
              of commitment, has changed over time in the direction of greater 
              or less 'cultishness', or is skilled at public relations. Because 
              they tend to focus on certain practices and behaviours, the definitions 
              advanced by AFF associates are implicitly interactionist. Like all 
              psychologically based models, they presume that different people 
              will respond differently to the same group environment, as much 
              as twins can respond differently to the same family environment. 
              Cults are not all alike. Nor are all cult members affected in the 
              same way, even within the same group.</p>
            <p>Because of the definitional confusion surrounding the term 'cult', 
              students of the field should carefully examine the cult phenomenon 
              in detail and avoid making hasty categorisation decisions about 
              specific groups.</p>
            <p>Since this paper has a broad focus, in what follows I will presume 
              the Zablocki definition of 'cult': 'an ideological organisation 
              held together by charismatic relationships and demanding total commitment'.</p>
            <p>Concerns about cults and related groups operate on four levels</p>
            <p><i>Psychological concerns</i></p>
            <p>Although cultic groups vary a great deal, a huge body of clinical 
              evidence and a growing body of empirical research indicate that 
              some groups harm some people sometimes, and that some groups may 
              be more likely to harm people than other groups. This proposition 
              is at the heart of the debate about 'cults'. A number of the programmes 
              at this conference explore ways in which cultic groups may adversely 
              affect individuals, families and society at large. This proposition 
              is amenable to systematic, empirical research that ought eventually 
              to be able to resolve current disputes about specific groups or 
              the general population of 'cultic groups'. Among the subjects that 
              have been or could be studied empirically are:</p>
            <p>. What psychological dynamics characterise groups at high risk 
              of harming members and families?</p>
            <p>. How can cultic environments be assessed empirically, in particular 
              with regard to the dimensions of control and harm?</p>
            <p>. What is the nature and magnitude of harm that current and former 
              members may experience?</p>
            <p>. How prevalent is high manipulation within cults?</p>
            <p>. How prevalent is harm within particular groups and across groups?</p>
            <p>. How prevalent are groups at high risk of harm?</p>
            <p>. How many individuals have been involved in such groups?</p>
            <p>. How many involved persons have been harmed?</p>
            <p>. How effective are psychological and other attempts at remedy?</p>
            <p>Some individuals on both sides of the controversy tend to ignore 
              the empirical foundation of the cult issue and affirm non-falsifiable 
              assumptions.</p>
            <p>Some, for example, seem to presume that all groups labelled cults 
              must be all bad and incapable of change. Messages on the Internet, 
              for example, have asserted that this conference's programme, 'Can 
              Cultic Groups Change: The Case of ISKCON', is a sign of naivety 
              on AFF's part, or even a sign that 'AFF has been taken over by cults'. 
              The underlying assumption of these criticisms seems to be that a 
              group such as ISKCON is incapable of positive change; therefore, 
              AFF must be wrong-headed or complicitous.</p>
            <p>Some observers on the other side of the controversy seem to presume 
              that all groups labelled cults are persecuted and benign. They sometimes 
              call negative reports of ex-members 'atrocity tales' (Bromley, Shupe, 
              &amp; Ventimiglia, 1979), a term that appears <i>a priori</i> to 
              dismiss all criticism of cultic groups as fabrications or face-saving 
              sour grapes.</p>
            <p>In between these extremes of 'see no evil' and 'see nothing but 
              evil' is a broad range of opinions. If these opinions are ever to 
              rise to the level of knowledge, disputing parties must engage in 
              sincere and substantive dialogue that recognises the need to phrase 
              the issues as questions that are amenable to scientific research. 
              Such research must be conducted as a co-ordinated programme of studies, 
              not a hodgepodge of unrelated studies pursued by isolated researchers.</p>
            <p>The workshop on Sunday, 'Towards a Common Research Agenda', will 
              attempt to contribute to the process of dialogue. Fortunately, some 
              useful research has been, or is being, conducted. Some of this research 
              will be discussed Saturday morning.</p>
            <p>Those in the helping professions, however, realise that one cannot 
              wait for research when people need help. One must do the best one 
              can with the knowledge and understanding at one's disposal. A number 
              of sessions in this conference offer advice based on the presenters' 
              current understanding of the issues, for example, the sessions on 
              support groups and psychological needs, and the workshops for families, 
              ex-members and those interested in education about the cult issue.</p>
            <p><i>Ethical concerns</i></p>
            <p>When faced with certain controversial practices, the first reaction 
              of many cult critics is, 'That's wrong.' Often, the specific behaviour 
              or practice being criticised results in psychological or other forms 
              of harm to people. Sometimes, however, the effects are not necessarily 
              harmful; yet, the criticism, 'That's wrong', remains. Lying about 
              one's group affiliation while trying to recruit people on a college 
              campus, for example, may not 'harm' the persons approached, but 
              those persons may feel offended that somebody would lie to them 
              in the name of religion, social betterment, or self-improvement; 
              they feel, 'It's wrong.'</p>
            <p>Although thought reform is usually associated with the psychological 
              dimension of the cult phenomenon, the cult critics who discuss thought 
              reform often implicitly place it in an ethical context. I have heard 
              from a colleague, for example, that some scholars in the organisational 
              psychology literature advocate the use of 'coercive persuasion' 
              techniques in order to improve organisational performance (I am 
              not personally familiar with this literature). He and I, and probably 
              most of our colleagues in this field, blanch at this notion. We 
              tend to believe that thought reform, or coercive persuasion, should 
              not be used on people, regardless of the presumed nobility or usefulness 
              of the goals. Ethically, people should not be treated in this way.</p>
            <p>A special issue of AFF's <i>Cultic Studies Journal</i> (Volume 
              2, Number 2) reported on the development of an ethical code for 
              the Christian evangelist, a code developed by a team of evangelicals 
              led by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. A modified version of 
              this code was adopted by Boston University (and possibly other schools) 
              to guide its religious personnel. I wish that more religion professionals 
              would look at this code and related work in order to begin to delineate 
              ethical boundaries for religious influence situations. What is needed 
              is an ethics casebook, similar to the casebooks developed by professional 
              associations in the mental health field.</p>
            <p>Dr Benjamin Zablocki has proposed a bill of inalienable rights 
              for intentional communities. He proposes voluntary guidelines on 
              matters such as the right to leave, to maintain contact with the 
              outside world, the right to an education, to adequate health access 
              and the right to impartial investigation of complaints. It is important 
              not to confuse ethical objections related to cultic groups with 
              other kinds of objections. One does not <i>have </i>to demonstrate 
              harm to justify an ethical criticism of a behaviour or practice. 
              Nor does one <i>have</i> to demonstrate thought reform. Many practices 
              and behaviours that are not part of a thought reform programme can 
              be criticised on ethical grounds. Similarly, one does not <i>have 
              </i>to whitewash ethical transgressions simply because some cult 
              critics unfairly characterise a group as using thought reform. </p>
            <p>Again, the two extremes of 'see no evil' and 'see nothing but evil' 
              miss the long continuum separating these two poles.The session on 
              ISKCON will address ethical issues, for the reform group within 
              ISKCON appears to recognise that some of the organisation's behaviours 
              and practices need to be subjected to ethical accountability. The 
              people I have talked with have shown much interest in the ethical 
              code developed by InterVarsity and in Dr Zablocki's bill of rights. 
              Recently, the abuse of children in ISKCON, which certainly has profound 
              ethical as well as psychological and medical implications, has been 
              an issue of great concern. Consider the following quotes:</p>
            <p>As a stigmatised and politically marginal group, householders were 
              left powerless to assert their parental authority over the lives 
              of their children. Children were abused in part because they were 
              not valued by leaders, and even, very often, by their own parents 
              who accepted theological and other justifications offered by the 
              leadership for remaining uninvolved in the lives of their children. 
              (Rochford &amp; Heinlein, pp. 43-44)</p>
            <p>Over the years, any number of estimates have been offered, ranging 
              from 20% of all students who attended an <i>asrama-gurukula</i> 
              suffering some form of abuse, to as many as 75% of the boys enrolled 
              at the <i>gurukula</i> at Vrndavana, India, having been sexually 
              molested during the late 1970s and early 1980s. (Rochford &amp; 
              Heinlein, p. 47)</p>
            <p>'I remember dark closets filled with flying dates (large, three-inch 
              flying cockroaches) and such, while beatings and "no <i>prasadam</i>" 
              for dinner became everyday affairs.' (Rochford &amp; Heinlein, p. 
              47)</p>
            <p>'Seattle was hell because I was only six years old, my mom lived 
              in Hawaii and I had always been a very shy mommy's girl. The movement 
              was in its earlier stages, and the devotees were fanatical &#151; 
              beyond fanatical. I mean, they would give us a bowl of hot milk 
              at night, so I would, of course, pee in my bed. Then as punishment 
              they would spank me very hard and make me wear the contaminated 
              panties on my head. In general, at that time, because I was so young, 
              I was so spaced out and confused. I would cry ... for my mom, but 
              that wasn't allowed, so I would say I was crying in devotional ecstasy.' 
              (Rochford &amp; Heinlein, p. 47)</p>
            <p>Is this quote from <i>Cultic Studies Journal?</i> No. Is it from 
              the <i>Cult Observer</i>? No. Is it even from the <i>Journal for 
              the Scientific Study of Religion</i>? No. It is from <i>ISKCON Communications 
              Journal,</i> and the article from which the quotes come was written 
              by E. Burke Rochford, Jr., with Jennifer Heinlein. Rochford is often 
              identified with the 'pro-cult' camp of sociologists.</p>
            <p>When the lawyers get their teeth into this issue, ISKCON may pay 
              a great price for the forthrightness demonstrated in its own journal. 
              However, if genuine reform is to occur, then the price must be paid 
              for past abuses and the ground laid for future accountability. The 
              organisation may pay a financial price. Many of the adult members 
              whose children were abused are undoubtedly already paying a heavy 
              price emotionally as they confront the terrible consequences of 
              their loyalty and obedience to the movement.</p>
            <p>We who are cult critics should not gloat and say, 'I told you years 
              ago that children were being abused in ISKCON.' It would have been 
              much better had we been wrong and innocent children not been abused. 
              We should take no satisfaction from their suffering. If we, as cult 
              critics, can offer constructive advice and commentary to the reform 
              element within ISKCON, we can do much more to help the children 
              (and adults) within ISKCON than we could by standing on the sidelines 
              shouting 'I see nothing but evil!' Even if the reform movement is 
              not fully confronting the organisation's problems, its capacity 
              to bring about constructive change is much greater than that of 
              its critics. How many cults have changed their practices in a substantial 
              way because of the criticisms of outsiders? Reform that grows from 
              within an organisation has a much greater chance of success than 
              reform that outsiders try to impose. This is not to say that criticism 
              from outside isn't important. It may stimulate persons within the 
              organisation to re-evaluate their group and press for change. However, 
              except in rare cases where legal authorities exercise power, change 
              will usually occur only when enough persons within the organisation 
              support it.</p>
            <p><i>Social concerns</i></p>
            <p>I think it is important to distinguish social concerns that reflect 
              offences against fundamental societal values from those that reflect 
              concerns against the idiosyncratic values of individuals. Society's 
              valuing of social order demands accountability when a group commits 
              the first offence. But society's valuing of individual freedom demands 
              that critics strive for tolerance when confronted by a group that 
              elicits idiosyncratic disapproval in them. Examples of the latter 
              category of concern include antagonism resulting from an observer's 
              disapproval of:</p>
            <p>.<b> </b>unconventional dress or lifestyle choices</p>
            <p>.<b> </b>religious beliefs different from his/her own</p>
            <p>.<b> </b>groups with a foreign origin</p>
            <p>.<b> </b>groups with a particular racial or ethnic makeup</p>
            <p>Examples of the former category include concerns resulting from 
              a group's violation of commonly held ethical and/or legal standards, 
              such as: criminal laws, including those related to immigration, 
              commerce and finances.</p>
            <p>.<b> </b>explicit or implicit standards of ethical influence (e.g., 
              lying to people in order to persuade them to come to a group-sponsored 
              event)</p>
            <p>. infiltration of government organisations</p>
            <p>. tax-evasion</p>
            <p>. abuse of the legal system through spurious lawsuits</p>
            <p>. pursuit of political goals while operating under the rubric of 
              a non-political, charitable or religious organisation</p>
            <p>. deceptive fund-raising and sales practices</p>
            <p>. unlawful pressuring of employees to participate in cultic 'educational' 
              programmes</p>
            <p>. misuse of charitable status in order to secure money for business 
              and other non-charitable purposes</p>
            <p>. unfair competition through the use of underpaid labour or 'recycled 
              salaries'</p>
            <p>. medical, psychological and educational neglect and/or abuse of 
              children</p>
            <p>. Misuse of school or college facilities</p>
            <p>In societies that cherish religious freedom, the balancing of religious 
              freedom and law enforcement may sometimes be difficult to achieve 
              or to gain consensus on. Two sessions in this conference will examine 
              how the legal and governmental systems in the US and Europe have 
              responded to cult issues. The Saturday evening discussion programme 
              is also likely to address this question of balance.</p>
            <p><i>Theological concerns</i></p>
            <p>If one accepts the notion that beliefs have consequences,<b> </b>then 
              one is likely to conclude that theological analyses may shed light 
              on the psychological, ethical and social implications of the cult 
              phenomenon.</p>
            <p>During the Waco stand-off, for example, some observers criticised 
              the FBI for not addressing the thought reform dimension of Waco. 
              Others criticised the FBI for not considering the theological beliefs 
              of David Koresh. Herb Rosedale and I wrote an essay at the time 
              in which we argued that both perspectives should have been considered. 
              (Rosedale &amp; Langone, 1993)</p>
            <p>I believe that theological analyses can contribute to the understanding 
              of cult-related phenomena. Professor Roger Olsen of Bethel Seminary 
              was to have spoken on this issue at this conference, but his circumstances 
              changed and thus he could not make the conference.</p>
            <p>Theological issues may arise in our discussion of changes in ISKCON. 
              How, for example, can reformers justify changes that, at least on 
              the surface, appear to conflict with the belief system set down 
              by the movement's founder? If they can make compelling justifications 
              for these changes within ISKCON's theological belief system, the 
              reformers  are likely to run into less resistance on practices that 
              have elicited considerable social concern.</p>
            <p>Those who offer theological analyses should be careful to recognise 
              that modern democratic societies place a protective wall around 
              belief &#151; and for good reason. One can believe bad things without 
              acting badly. The tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, demonstrates this 
              point. As commentators try to 'explain' why the young men went on 
              a killing spree, they point to a host of possible causes: they revered 
              Adolf Hitler; they hated 'jocks'; they were racist; etc. But thousands 
              of people who do not murder others share these beliefs. If we locked 
              people up for their beliefs, our prisons would burst. Nevertheless, 
              critical analysis of potentially destructive belief systems may 
              lessen the probability that some people will act upon those beliefs, 
              in part by decreasing the probability that some may be persuaded 
              to adopt them in the first place. That is why AFF has worked with 
              certain individuals and organisations that focus on theological 
              analyses of cultic groups. To the extent they can help people think 
              more discerningly, they can lessen the probability that people will 
              get caught up in destructive systems. Of course, some think that 
              all religions are hogwash, that the Heaven's Gate philosophy is 
              no more irrational than that of Christianity or Judaism. I believe 
              these people are wrong. </p>
            <p>Although all religions rest on assumptions about a transcendental 
              reality that can't be accessed scientifically, conceptual structures 
              built on these assumptions can vary greatly with regard to internal 
              logical coherence and the degree to which they respond constructively 
              to human needs that are common across cultures. Some theological 
              critics might argue that cultic conceptual structures will undermine 
              attempts at reform because they lack logical coherence and don't 
              adequately meet human needs. Sometimes, the theology of a particular 
              group may be so inconsistent and contrary to human needs that adaptation 
              to society will be impossible. As a psychologist, however, I have 
              come to have great faith in the human capacity to creatively rationalise 
              contradictory beliefs and behaviours, so I am more optimistic about 
              reform for many groups, at least in the short run. In the long run, 
              however, reality always wins. So I advise against dismissing out 
              of hand theological critiques of groups' conceptual structures.</p>
            <p><i>Important not to mix up concerns</i></p>
            <p>People sometimes act as though a valid criticism in one of the 
              four major areas of concern &#151; psychological, ethical, legal 
              and theological &#151; necessarily implies that potential concerns 
              in the other three areas must also be valid. If, for example, a 
              group has an unorthodox belief system (e.g., it follows an Indian 
              guru), the group may be 'presumed' to be psychologically harmful, 
              unethical and legally suspect. Drawing such conclusions, however, 
              is an unwarranted conceptual leap, the kind of false inference that 
              encourages unthinking polarisation, rather than thoughtful dialogue. 
              Although it may be the case that the socially deviant group violates 
              the law, behaves unethically and harms people, it is not necessarily, 
              nor even probably the case. Evidence, not presumption, should rule.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>In closing, let me reiterate the proposition that I believe is 
              central to the cult issue: Some groups may harm some people sometimes, 
              and some groups may be more likely to harm people than other groups.</p>
            <p>The so-called pro-cult-anti-cult debate really revolves around 
              different judgement calls people make with regard to how many groups 
              are at risk for harm, how much harm they contribute, what causes 
              the harm, and what should be done about it. We must make judgement 
              calls about such questions because we lack sufficient empirical 
              data to resolve the disputes.</p>
            <p>If we are to avoid replacing the closed-mindedness of high control 
              groups with another form of closed-mindedness, in which we treat 
              our opinions as facts, people on both sides of the cult dispute 
              must acknowledge the following:</p>
            <p>. Despite the commendable scientific research that has been conducted, 
              much, maybe most, of what we think we know is opinion (however informed 
              and reasonable it may be), not scientific fact.</p>
            <p>. If we are to increase our scientific understanding of this phenomenon, 
              we must put substantial resources into studying it scientifically 
              in a co-ordinated way, not the usual academic route of each researcher 
              working independently, chasing whatever question happens to grab 
              his or her fancy.</p>
            <p>. We must be willing to change our opinions as scientific knowledge 
              increases.</p>
            <p>As we struggle to increase our scientific knowledge, we must try 
              to help hurt people and forewarn those as yet unaffected, especially 
              youth, as best as we can. But we should do this with a humility 
              that permits us to continue to learn, even as we teach and counsel.</p>
