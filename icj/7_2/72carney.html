            <p>The second in an ongoing series of dialogues in the Washington 
              DC area took place on 9-10 April 1999. Like the first dialogue, 
              held the previous year, the participants included Christians from 
              the Catholic, Episcopalian, Methodist and Anglican traditions and 
              Vaisnavas from the Gaudiya and Madhva traditions. This year's dialogue 
              was expanded to include an overnight stay at the retreat centre 
              as well as an opportunity to share in worship together on the second 
              day. The first day was devoted to scholarly discussion of the conference 
              theme and the second day to shared worship and reflection on the 
              theme in light of those experiences.</p>
            <p>The conference theme addressed the experience of divine presence 
              in the world as well as the mode of responding to that presence. 
              It was very important that the theological dialogue was based on 
              selections from texts that are central to the Christian and Vaisnava 
              traditions respectively, the Gospel of John and the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. 
              Presenters had provided the participants with assigned readings 
              that greatly helped involvement in the discussion. </p>
            <p>After a warm welcome from Anuttama Dasa and a first round of introductions, 
              we listened to a presentation by Margo Stevenson of Catholic University 
              on the relation between the divine spirit and the world in four 
              passages of the Gospel of John: the prologue, which points to the 
              Word of God becoming flesh in this world; the narrative about the 
              man born blind, which sets the historical context of conflict in 
              'the world'; a selection from the farewell discourse of Jesus in 
              which he promises his disciples the gift of the spirit to protect 
              them in that world, even in the midst of conflict; and the deep 
              conflict revealed in the dramatic interrogation of Jesus by the 
              Roman governor.</p>
            <p>The second presentation, by Ravindra Svarupa Dasa of ISKCON, focused 
              on key themes of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. Krsna instructs Arjuna 
              in his duty to sustain the ethical order of <i>dharma </i>in the 
              world. Even in the midst of moral ambiguity, Arjuna should not renounce 
              the actions required by <i>dharma </i>to uphold the world but he 
              should act selflessly, with no regard for the fruits of his action. 
              This type of renunciation is an affirmation of the true moral order 
              and is based on devotional surrender of self and work to Krsna. 
              Krsna's appearance in the world shows both his unconditional love 
              and His judgement on the world. Krsna reveals the path of devotional 
              surrender to God that is the foundation of selfless service to God 
              and to society.</p>
            <p>The lengthy and quite candid discussion which followed these presentations 
              showed how differently Christians and Vaisnavas experience divine 
              presence (as incarnation or as <i>avatara</i>) and how deeply they 
              are engaged with similar struggles to live 'in the world' without 
              being 'of the world' that is hostile to God and under divine judgement. 
              Both Christians and Vaisnavas strive to be faithful disciples and 
              to engage in action that is animated by selfless love and devotional 
              surrender. We explored together our very fundamental differences 
              in understanding divine presence and in understanding 'the world'. 
              However, one participant commented towards the end of the discussion 
              that, despite such deep religious and philosophical differences, 
              Christians and Vaisnavas share this call to be committed in selfless 
              service and loving surrender to God. There is fertile ground for 
              encounter to flourish on this level of religious experience and 
              commitment.</p>
            <p>On the second day of the dialogue, we started with a shared experience 
              of <i>arati </i>and <i>kirtana </i>from the Gaudiya tradition, followed 
              by an interpretation of a text from the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>. 
              We continued with an experience of Christian prayer in readings, 
              interpretation and song. In <i>bhajana </i>and <i>kirtana</i>, in 
              hymn and song, the participants had an experience of each other 
              and saw the others' beliefs in a new light. The tone of the discussion, 
              led by Kenneth Cracknell of Brite Divinity School, showed the impact 
              of these experiences. The participants introduced themselves again 
              &#151; with greater detail and more intimacy. Reflecting on this, 
              Dr Cracknell identified the change that dimensions of physicality 
              (dance, movement, song) add to religious encounter. This link made 
              it possible to see the necessary tension between affirmation and 
              renunciation of material existence, but also to give a more positive 
              understanding of the divine presence in the sacred places of our 
              world. Dr Cracknell summarised the challenge facing both Christians 
              and Vaisnavas in finding a way to live with both religion <i>and 
              </i>secular culture while seeking the conversion of the culture. 
              The discussion drew on the previous day's theme of selfless service 
              in the midst of a suffering world. As the participants looked together 
              at the religious challenges facing them, their responses converged 
              on the many ways in which they as believers sought to give new spirit 
              to the world. The depth of this discussion came largely because 
              the participants had the luxury of time to speak informally and, 
              especially, to share worship together. However irreducible their 
              systems of belief might be, such an experience of sharing allowed 
              the participants in this dialogue to speak heart to heart.</p>
            <p>The spring weather was brisk during much of the conference, but 
              it warmed up on Saturday afternoon to allow us to eat lunch outside 
              and to conclude our discussions. The grounds of Rockwood Manor are 
              beautiful and we were blessed with delicious food. It was no surprise 
              that we lingered over lunch, enjoying the friendships that had been 
              developed in dialogue. All were committed to continuing these sessions, 
              combining talks by specialists with the experiential dimension that 
              proved so fruitful in advancing both understanding and discussion. 
              The participants expressed a hope for expanded participation of 
              Christian churches and of various Vaisnava traditions. In conclusion, 
              all the participants expressed their thanks to Anuttama Dasa and 
              the other Washington-based leaders who had developed the programme.
