            <p><i>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, a long-time participant to ISKCON reform, 
              presents in this paper a first-hand historical overview of the problems 
              facing ISKCON, and what he sees as a sure point for successful change.</i></p>
            <p>A devotee, therefore, should execute his devotional services with 
              full energy, endurance, and confidence. He should perform his scheduled 
              duties, he should be pure in heart, and he should serve in association 
              with devotees. All six of these items will lead the devotee to the 
              path of success. One should not be discouraged in the discharge 
              of devotional service. Failures may not be detrimental; they may 
              be the pillars of success. (<i>Light of the Bhagavata, </i>43)</p>
            <p>In October of 1984, I became active in what was later to be known 
              within ISKCON as 'the guru reform movement'. Over the next two years 
              I wrote a series of widely circulated papers in an  attempt to understand 
              and help rectify some failures in ISKCON. As things turned out, 
              I became a leader of the reform movement. At the annual meeting 
              of the Governing Body Commission (GBC) in March of 1987, the reform 
              effort reached a denouement of sorts. Four of the most powerful 
              leaders of ISKCON all (simultaneously) <i>sannyasis</i>, initiating 
              gurus and GBC members resigned or were removed from office, each 
              under a noisome cloud of scandal.</p>
            <p>These and other depredations had shrunk the GBC to fifteen members. 
              At the same time, the GBC had empowered an outside 'Committee of 
              Fifty', all senior disciples of Srila Prabhupada, to interview and 
              evaluate each of the remaining GBC members and to share its findings 
              with the body. That being accomplished, the GBC then requested that 
              committee to place before the GBC the names of some devotees as 
              prospective new members. (The GBC added new members by a two-thirds 
              vote.)</p>
            <p>My name was among those proposed, and I was voted onto the body. 
              I had wanted to return to my services of writing and scholarship 
              with the Bhaktivedanta Institute and the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 
              but I fell unwittingly under the sway of a fairly well-established 
              law: If you lead a successful revolution, you are condemned to become 
              part of the government. There is no doubt that in the activities 
              of reform I had to criticise many devotees who &#151; deviations 
              and shortcomings notwithstanding harboured an inviolable seed of 
              devotion to Prabhupada and Krsna. Having to serve on the GBC was 
              only a fitting punishment for my offence.</p>
            <p>Although I prefer the contemplative to the active life, it is true 
              that my active engagements with the guru reform movement and later 
              the GBC have repeatedly produced bumper crops of material to feed 
              contemplation. I should explain that reflecting on the Hare Krishna 
              movement &#151; in that mode of critical self-awareness inculcated 
              in academia &#151; formed, from the beginning, an important component 
              of my involvement with it.</p>
            <p>In 1971 I had moved with spouse and children into a fledgeling 
              temple community in Philadelphia, thereby committing our joint and 
              several futures to Prabhupada's movement. It was indeed an act of 
              faith, but faith seeks ceaselessly to understand, and I strove daily 
              to comprehend more fully just what I had done, what adventure I 
              had embarked on. The understanding that gradually took shape was 
              composed of three closely interrelated dimensions; and these three, 
              eventually, were to provide me with the features of certain broad 
              principles for reform. I shall call them the historical, the personal 
              and the social.</p>
            <p>Prior to my joining ISKCON I had seriously pursued academic study 
              in religion and philosophy. Although the limits of the merely academic 
              impelled me to refuge within a living spiritual tradition, I could 
              not simply shed my prior formation. And so it was with a certain 
              thrill that I realised that, having joined the Hare Krishna movement, 
              I was granted the closest, real-time access to a kind of event that 
              fascinates scholars of religion: a religion transplanting itself 
              from its natal culture. I had once studied the movement of Christianity 
              from its original Jewish milieu into the cosmopolitan Mediterranean 
              world of the <i>pax Romana</i>. Now I recognised a parallel in Prabhupada's 
              ISKCON: Gaudiya Vaisnavism being led from its Bengal cradle-land 
              into the modern global civilisation of the <i>pax Americana</i>. 
              I didn't have just a 'ring-side seat' to this event; I was in the 
              ring.</p>
            <p>I was committed. I had committed more than this life to the mercies 
              of ISKCON. I had committed my very soul. In spite of my predilections 
              for the long historical perspective, I was anything but a disinterested 
              observer. My own personal stake in the success of Srila Prabhupada's 
              endeavour had an individual as well as a social dimension. As an 
              individual, I had committed myself to the enterprise of becoming 
              a pure devotee. Prabhupada had succeeded in convincing a coterie 
              of idealistic American youth that sainthood was a feasible vocation, 
              a 'live option', and I was one among them. Prabhupada called us 
              to a kind of heroism of risk, of commitment, and of sacrifice in 
              an ultimate 'war against <i>maya</i>'. Prabhupada taught that this 
              consummate victory was granted only to those prepared to subordinate 
              all other concerns to the service of this single ultimate concern. 
              When I took initiation from him, I pledged myself to this principle. 
              Yet I could not carry out this pledge by myself; I required favourable 
              grounds. That was ISKCON, painstakingly crafted by Prabhupada himself, 
              placed by him in late twentieth century America, to nourish and 
              foster my personal pilgrimage toward pure service to God.</p>
            <p>ISKCON harboured a further significance: ISKCON was itself my service. 
              Even as ISKCON nurtured me, I was bound in turn to nurture ISKCON. 
              Assisting Srila Prabhupada in his mission was both my obligation 
              and my saving grace. His mission was to deliver throngs of fallen 
              souls through propagation of the <i>sankirtana yuga-dharma</i>, 
              effecting thereby 'a respiritualisation of the entire human society'. 
              In this effort, ISKCON was both his means and his end. In the <i>bhakti 
              sankirtana </i>movement, as Prabhupada taught it, saving myself 
              and saving the world entailed each other. ISKCON was the context 
              for both.</p>
            <p><i>Bhakti </i>is at once personalistic and social, for it is a 
              philosophical truth that the personal and the social cannot be separated. 
              What a 'person' is can be fully manifest only through interactions 
              with other persons. This principle is exemplified at the highest 
              ontological level in Krsna, whose supreme personhood entails that 
              He is also supremely social. The fullness of the Godhead entails 
              that the supreme, transcendental Absolute is equally the supremely, 
              transcendentally relative. Krsna, therefore, is never alone but 
              always in the company of his devotees. He is constituted by relationships, 
              and many of His proper and eternal names include those of his nearest 
              and dearest &#151; as, for example, Radha-kanta (Radha's sweetheart), 
              Yasoda-nandana (Yasoda's darling boy), Partha-sarathi (charioteer 
              to Prtha's son) and so on. For this reason, <i>bhakti</i> &#151; 
              devotional service &#151; is pre-eminently a social activity, and 
              that social principle attains its fullest exfoliation in the idea 
              of <i>sankirtana</i>, the congregational glorification of God's 
              name, fame, activities and so on. Therefore, Prabhupada's founding 
              a society of devotees was not simply a tactical expedience; it was 
              a metaphysical necessity.</p>
            <p>The effort of Prabhupada, then, was to establish the community 
              or communion of devotees, a communion that, out of the natural overflowing 
              of its own joy, would be ever increasing. That communion is one 
              in which certain kinds of personal transactions would take place 
              among the devotees; by them, the devotional consciousness of the 
              participants would ever increase; and, in a spirit of compassion 
              for those suffering outside this community, the members would always 
              be initiating others into their circle to share in the felicity 
              of their communion. </p>
            <p>Prabhupada, however, was not inaugurating this society <i>de novo</i>, 
              from scratch. Inducted into ISKCON, we became part of a <i>sampradaya 
              </i>(the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya, to be precise), a venerable 
              historical community whose task, generation after generation, was 
              properly and correctly to receive a spiritual culture, attain full 
              formation and realisation through it, and pass it on complete and 
              sound, free from any adulteration, to the next generation. Although 
              Prabhupada came to us in the West as a solitary figure (an anomaly 
              we shall examine later), he was the repository of a vastly rich 
              tradition of teachers and students, who studied, composed, taught 
              and practised volumes of theology, commentary, drama, poetry and 
              song. When we became Prabhupada's students, he was initiating us 
              into the teachings and practices of that tradition, to become its 
              heirs.</p>
            <p>Here, then, was quite another way the historical past came to be 
              known by me &#151; as age-old tradition, received and transmitted 
              through authority. It is the outstanding national trait of Americans 
              to be without tradition. A nation of migrants, the United States 
              could realise more thoroughly than Europe the Enlightenment project 
              of a radical break with the past, of wholesale rejection of traditional 
              political and spiritual authority, of the reinvention of humanity 
              from the ground up. In America, tradition and traditional authorities 
              are reflexively viewed with scepticism, suspicion and even hostility. 
              Rootlessness is the national style, and the ability to perpetually 
              reinvent oneself through a series of discrete identities is practically 
              the national ideal. It is, unfortunately, the world's future, as 
              indigenous communities and traditions are dissolved by the solvent 
              of the ever-spreading <i>pax Americana</i>, to survive only in the 
              travesty of the theme park and the multi-media 'experience'. At 
              first, American &#151; I should say modern &#151; rootlessness was 
              an important, even necessary, condition for the beginning of ISKCON; 
              very soon, it became one the greatest impediments to its development 
              and continuance. The contrast between the condition of modern America 
              and the 'Vedic' culture of tradition and authority, of continuity 
              and conservation, that Prabhupada was attempting to transplant could 
              hardly have been greater. With growing amazement, I gradually got 
              sight of the immensity of Prabhupada's endeavour. It was breathtaking. 
            </p>
            <p>I also came to see that Prabhupada was very well aware of the overwhelming 
              difficulty of his undertaking. Seeing him immersed in that endeavour 
              gave me new appreciation for certain of his oft-repeated sayings, 
              such as 'Impossible is a word found in a fool's dictionary,' and 
              for his injunction to 'shoot the rhinoceros' (meaning that if you 
              are to attempt something, you might as well make it something formidable). 
              As Prabhupada explained in a 1971 letter to Balavanta Dasa: 'We 
              should always be enthusiastic to try for shooting the rhinoceros. 
              That way, if we fail, everybody will say, "Never mind, nobody can 
              shoot a rhinoceros anyway," and if we succeed, then everyone will 
              say, "Just see, what a wonderful thing they have done."' </p>
            <p>Prabhupada understood the obstacles, but he remained ever-confident, 
              and instilled the same confidence in others. His ability to convey 
              a sense of unshakable confidence in himself and his mission attained 
              its impressive power because it was evidently part and parcel of 
              a simple and deep humility. The confidence of Prabhupada reposed, 
              of course, on supernatural foundations, on firm dependence on guru 
              and Krsna, and therefore it held impervious to all failures and 
              setbacks. 'So I don't think there is any cause of discouragement', 
              he wrote in 1969 to Vrndavanesvari, 'because we are working on a 
              different platform.'</p>
            <p>Yet at every minute Srila Prabhupada was wrestling with failure 
              and setbacks. Indeed, as I was gradually to learn, when Prabhupada 
              single-handedly conducted Caitanya's mission to the West, he did 
              so as the sole undebilitated survivor of a monstrous spiritual failure 
              in India, the foundering of his spiritual master's mission and institution, 
              the Gaudiya Matha. He came to America like a survivor paddling away 
              from a colossal shipwreck. Even from the beginning of his Western 
              mission, Prabhupada was carrying on in the face of massive failure 
              and discouragement in the generation previous to us. He noted this, 
              for example, in a letter of 1972 responding to a disheartened Guru 
              Dasa: 'Do not be depressed. All along my godbrothers gave me only 
              depression, repression, compression &#151; but I continued strong 
              in my duty. So never mind there is some discouragement, continue 
              with your work in full enthusiastic Krishna Consciousness attitude 
              of service.' </p>
            <p>Prabhupada's own movement also soon provided him with ample reason 
              for discouragement. From the very outset there was trouble: his 
              authority was challenged; his position compromised; his instructions 
              distorted, neglected or selectively followed; his teachings moulded 
              to various fancies; his assets misused, mismanaged and misappropriated; 
              his standards broken; his dependents neglected, exploited and abused. 
              And the worst of this was committed by men Prabhupada entrusted 
              with responsible positions. Prabhupada travelled continuously around 
              the world, grappling with problems. Each day his mail washed up 
              to him a jumbled deposit of scandals, failures and disappointments. 
              Internal weaknesses and shortcomings turned the eleven years of 
              Prabhupada's personal supervision into a concatenation of crises. 
            </p>
            <p>It is a noteworthy feature of ISKCON during that time that there 
              was hardly any frank and open acknowledgement of the problems among 
              the members. Even though almost any of us could provide impressively 
              detailed accounts of a plethora of scandals and failures, a weird 
              sort of schizoid compartmentalisation allowed us to maintain the 
              conviction that we as a society were pure and transcendental and 
              that, almost by definition, we could do no wrong. Scandals and failures 
              tended each to be viewed as discrete and anomalous, and they were 
              rarely surveyed as a whole to alarm us with the picture of a chronic 
              condition, a pervasive pattern, a trend. We became so captivated 
              by our own dazzling ideals that we were blinded to our actual behaviour. 
              We could have benefitted by accepting some of the devastatingly 
              accurate criticisms levelled against us by the anti-cult movement, 
              but unfortunately the anti-cultists called for the destruction of 
              ISKCON. Their condemnations were indiscriminate and sweeping, and 
              they in no way wished us well. As a result, they simply fostered 
              the very bunker mentality they condemned and only fed the self-righteousness 
              of the devotees.</p>
            <p>Yet given all that, it was more than possible to flourish spiritually 
              within ISKCON. True, when I moved into a temple of little over a 
              dozen residents, it was a shock to discover the extent of the struggle 
              with spiritual weakness that went on daily. It was a test to undergo 
              the difficulties of human relations within a small, tightly-knit, 
              high-demand, high-intensity, religious community, especially one 
              nearly bereft of the human comforts of social or psychological compatibilities. 
              Nevertheless, one could, if one wanted, negotiate all the individual 
              and group minefields, and not only advance in Krsna consciousness, 
              but also deliver it effectively to others. In fact, I could do neither 
              of those things at all outside of ISKCON. If, on my worst days, 
              I found myself thinking that the devotees I lived with were fools 
              and rascals, I always reminded myself that without these fools and 
              rascals, I could make no advancement in Krsna consciousness. I had 
              better learn to appreciate them. We were, all of us, fools and rascals; 
              nevertheless, Prabhupada still enabled us to do miraculous things, 
              rendered all the more miraculous in light of the character of the 
              performers.</p>
            <p>Thus, it was not until after the demise of its founder-acarya in 
              1977 that ISKCON as a n institution had to acknowledge and come 
              to terms with its failures and shortcomings. At first &#151; with 
              the lineage apparently handed over securely by Prabhupada to eleven 
              hand-picked successor-<i>acaryas</i> &#151; ISKCON set out with 
              great panache, leaping off with the boyish ebullience of Siegfried 
              bounding down to the Rhine, horn blaring. Yet it was not long before 
              ISKCON had to confront, at last, its own shadow, as over the decade 
              intractable failures and shortcomings &#151; abuse of authority, 
              enjoyment of position, attachment to material pleasures, and the 
              like &#151; emerged within the group of initiating gurus. The movement 
              was forced to begin facing, frankly and openly, the gap between 
              its ideals and its actual achievements. We had attained the condition 
              for real progress.</p>
            <p>So profound was ISKCON's denial, its concealment of its own problems 
              from itself, that many reacted initially as if these problems among 
              leaders were some shocking brand-new phenomenon. They contrasted 
              the prelapsarian paradise of ISKCON under Prabhupada with the now 
              hopelessly degenerate society, devoid as it is of the salvific presence 
              of any '<i>maha-bhagavata</i>'. Some awaited eagerly the emergence 
              of a new 'self-effulgent <i>acarya</i>' who would restore us to 
              our lost purity. There are those who still await the coming of such 
              a saviour, while there are yet others who proclaim to have found 
              him manifest in the person of some particular devotee, usually this 
              or that elderly Indian <i>sannyasi</i>.</p>
            <p>Yet even in the presence of Prabhupada &#151; the all-acknowledged 
              '<i>maha-bhagavata</i>' &#151; ISKCON regularly failed to live up 
              to its own ideals. Moreover, it was during Prabhupada's presence 
              that ISKCON devotees were most successful at maintaining their concealment; 
              only after Prabhupada was gone did the concealment begin to break 
              down. It has taken longest for those failures enacted during Prabhupada's 
              own presence to attain admission to consciousness. Seeking the reason 
              for this delayed recognition has led me to face an uncomfortable 
              fact: It was Prabhupada's very presence that had gradually begun 
              to function for many devotees as an instrument of concealment and 
              denial.</p>
            <p>It was natural for us to identify ourselves to some extent with 
              Prabhupada as the living embodiment of our ideals and to see him 
              as the very personification of ISKCON (so that his purity became 
              ours). This helped us maintain our ideals and our enthusiasm to 
              attain them even in the face of setbacks and adversity. However, 
              such a relationship turns unhealthy if I engage in the worship or 
              adoration of an ideal precisely in order to compensate for personal 
              failures. In such cases, my self-respect no longer resides in the 
              heroism of my struggle, for I have given up on the struggle, without 
              acknowledging that I have done so. Now, as a substitute for dealing 
              honestly with my failures, I identify intensely myself with my saviour-figure. 
              My disowned anxieties about my true condition and the psychic tensions 
              of concealment find release as adulation, one that reveals its origin 
              in falsity though its strident, driven character. In such cases, 
              worshipping a guru becomes a substitute for becoming Krsna conscious. 
              Thus we have the too familiar phenomenon in ISKCON (then and now) 
              of fanatical followers and so-called 'guru groupies'. This pathological 
              submergence of self into an all-powerful, idealised saviour-figure 
              is, of course, one of the phenomena that gives rise to the notion 
              of a 'cult'. It is a sure sign of arrested spiritual development 
              disguising itself as true religion. </p>
            <p>The point is that the difficulties that precipitated the guru reform 
              movement are intimately connected with psychological patterns and 
              styles of relationships that began to establish themselves from 
              the beginning. These are grounded in the inability of many devotees 
              to acknowledge and deal fruitfully with their own spiritual shortcomings 
              and failures, or, in traditional vocabulary, their inability to 
              execute the process of <i>anartha-nivrtti</i> (the eradication of 
              'unwanted things' from the heart). This general, widespread failure, 
              which pervades the institution and has even shaped some structural 
              features of it, is the root debility, of which the guru crisis &#151; 
              the 'crisis of succession' &#151; is simply a highly visible symptom. 
              It is my conviction that any real reform has to address effectively 
              the root debility. Too many of us have tried to fix the symptom 
              while ignoring the local manifestation of the disease, including 
              the manifestation within our own hearts. Too many have tried to 
              purify ISKCON as a substitute for purifying ourselves. This kind 
              of behaviour is the disease, not the cure.</p>
            <p>In 1979 questions about the gurus' position had burst out in major 
              eruptions at ISKCON centres at Vrndavana and Juhu Beach, ejecting 
              over the rest of the movement thick fascicles of photocopied papers. 
              In May of 1980 the GBC body was forced to convene an 'extraordinary 
              general meeting' &#151; an emergency meeting &#151; in Los Angeles 
              to find immediate responses to controversial behaviour on the part 
              of Hamsaduta Swami (abuse of power, drugs, sex, crime), Jayatirtha 
              Swami (LSD, as it would turn out), and Tamala Krsna Goswami (extreme 
              autocracy). A mere three months after sanctioning these gurus, the 
              GBC issued a philosophical position paper defending the position 
              that the current gurus were to be understood as <i>maha-bhagavata</i>s. 
              In any case, by 1981 the GBC had to remove Hamsaduta from his position, 
              and it did the same with Jayatirtha in 1982. By this point, most 
              senior devotees believed that guru failures and abuses were going 
              to continue and the GBC could not control them. This growing anxiety 
              finally found institutional articulation at a routine meeting of 
              the North American temple presidents and <i>sannyasis</i> in September 
              of 1984. The thirty-five voting members present polled themselves 
              and discovered that 94% of them believed that 'there are fundamental 
              and compelling problems with the guru institution as it presently 
              exists in ISKCON'.</p>
            <p>The group called a second meeting in November to pursue this issue 
              further, and, in spite of a good deal of reluctance, I was persuaded 
              to attend the meeting. Much to my surprise, I found myself becoming 
              greatly enlivened and encouraged by the association and the commitment 
              of the devotees. I realised, with a shock, that quite unconsciously 
              I had fallen into a state of despair about ISKCON &#151; and about 
              myself as well. I was in a spiritual slump, and the meeting was 
              waking me up. At this gathering I was asked to conduct research 
              to determine just exactly what had gone wrong with the way the position 
              of the guru had been institutionalised in ISKCON. I agreed to take 
              the job.</p>
            <p>Back in Philadelphia, I concluded that the only way I could responsibly 
              conduct research on such a loaded subject was to attempt to entrust 
              myself to the guidance of Supersoul, the indwelling guide and director 
              of intelligence. I feared more than anything else my own stupidity. 
              I was the straw man, and I needed a brain. I decided to entrust 
              myself to Prabhupada's instructions for attaining direction from 
              Supersoul. Thus, as a remedial measure, I undertook to rigorously 
              restore my <i>sadhana </i>to a strict level. I defined good <i>sadhana</i> 
              as chanting the holy name while trying assiduously to avoid offences. 
              In this way, I would be in a position to receive intelligence from 
              Krsna whenever He chose to give it. Prabhupada's instructions were 
              as potent as they are simple: </p>
            <p>In all spiritual affairs, one's first duty is to control his mind 
              and senses. Unless one controls his mind and senses, one cannot 
              make any advancement in spiritual life. Everyone within this material 
              world is engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance. One must 
              promote himself to the platform of goodness, <i>sattva-guna</i>, 
              by following the instructions of Rupa Goswami in the first verse 
              of <i>Upadesamrta</i>, and then everything concerning how to make 
              further progress will be revealed. (<i>The Nectar of Instruction,</i> 
              Preface)</p>
            <p>It seemed that this was as pertinent for guidance of the entire 
              movement as it was for personal guidance. </p>
            <p>As my <i>sadhana </i>became strict, my spirits picked up, and my 
              despair over the fate of ISKCON began to evaporate like fog. And 
              every day I thought hard about what had gone wrong in ISKCON. Then 
              a breakthrough came.</p>
            <p>One evening some of us who had attended the meeting in Towaco were 
              discussing strategy. Sesa Dasa, the temple president, was there, 
              as well as Mahakrama Swami, who had been elected vice-chairman in 
              Towaco. He was also the regional secretary for Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, 
              the initiating guru and GBC for our area. Although Satsvarupa Maharaja 
              would later publish an influential book called <i>Guru Reform</i>, 
              his initial reaction to the nascent reform movement had been filled 
              with misgivings. He did not interfere with our participation, yet 
              he had publicly expressed strong reservations about the Towaco meetings, 
              questioning the suitability of politics to deal with spiritual issues. 
              After our strategy meeting broke up that night, Sesa took me aside 
              and warned me: 'You know, you should be really careful about what 
              you say around Mahakrama! He reports everything back to Satsvarupa 
              Maharaja. You should know that.'</p>
            <p>I was stunned. I thought: 'Here we are supposed to be the reform 
              party, and we think we can save ISKCON, but we cannot even trust 
              each other. How will we be any better?' It was during the sleepless 
              night that followed that I came to realise that the 'guru problem' 
              was merely a symptom of a disease, with which we were all infected. 
              The polarity of 'us-and-them' was wrong. I remembered the famous 
              motto of Pogo, the newspaper-comic possum: 'We have met the enemy 
              &#151; and he is us!' Any effort at reform that did not begin with 
              myself and with our 'side' would be superficial and counter-productive. 
              It would indeed be mundane politics.</p>
            <p>Ideas flooded into my head, and in the morning I began intensely 
              discussing them with Kundali Dasa and others and setting them down 
              on paper. Addressing my godbrothers and godsisters. I began by asserting, 
              'The root of all problems now facing ISKCON is that we, the disciples 
              of Srila Prabhupada, have not yet established proper Vaisnava relationships 
              among ourselves. While Prabhupada was here with us, we did not enjoy 
              such relationships, and our spiritual master plainly told us that 
              our greatest fault was our tendency to quarrel with each other.' 
              And then I went on to commit to writing &#151; for the first time 
              &#151; my honest perceptions of life in ISKCON:</p>
            <p>A society of devotees in which proper Vaisnava relations are not 
              yet the norm is called a <i>kanistha-adhikari</i> society. Its distinguishing 
              characteristic is contentiousness arising from envy. Envy is a product 
              of false ego. Because of false ego, the members are unable to establish 
              spiritual friendship among themselves. Instead, they vie with each 
              other for prestige, power and perquisites. Intensely desiring the 
              honour and respect of others, the contentious neophyte pretends 
              to be more advanced than he actually is. He tries to conceal his 
              shortcomings and falldowns, and in so doing he develops a secretive 
              mentality and holds himself back from entering into open and honest 
              relations with his Godbrothers. Because he cannot reveal his mind 
              in confidence, he remains aloof from real fellowship.</p>
            <p>He strays from the path of devotional service, but his peers do 
              not help him. For he thinks that if he allows someone to preach 
              to him, he implicitly admits his own subordination. Therefore he 
              cuts himself off from hearing and becomes impervious to instruction 
              or good advice. Because he has many secret misgivings about himself, 
              he becomes eager to find the faults of others; that way he reassures 
              himself of his own superiority in spite of his many unacknowledged 
              weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Spiritual immaturity often leads a <i>kanistha-adhikari</i> to 
              identify spiritual advancement with organisational advancement. 
              He thinks that attaining prestige, power and the perquisites of 
              office is evidence of spiritual advancement. Lacking the assets 
              for real spiritual achievement, he substitutes organisational elevation, 
              which he can attain through his cunning or political prowess. He 
              therefore competes intensely with others for high office, and he 
              comes to believe implicitly that one achieves a spiritually elevated 
              state only by becoming victorious over others. In this way material 
              competition becomes institutionalised in <i>kanistha-adhikari</i> 
              societies.</p>
            <p>I could also propose a path of reform:</p>
            <p>Fortunately, however, the <i>kanistha</i> stage is followed by 
              the <i>madhyama</i> stage. A <i>kanistha-adhikari</i> advances to 
              the <i>madhyama</i> platform by means of <i>sadhana-bhakti</i>. 
              <i>Sadhana-bhakti</i>, pursued diligently and attentively, destroys 
              false ego, and as long as the neophyte devotees attend to their 
              <i>sadhana</i> they can be sure of elevation to the higher stages. 
              There is, however, no other assured means of advancement, and habitual 
              negligence in <i>sadhana</i> is therefore fatal to progressive spiritual 
              life. Furthermore, when a neophyte devotee has risen to the <i>madhyama</i> 
              platform, <i>sadhana</i> is absolutely necessary to maintain him 
              in that position. If he becomes slack in <i>sadhana</i>, he rapidly 
              reverts to the neophyte condition. Therefore, the essential prerequisite 
              for both creating and sustaining a <i>madhyama</i> society is intense 
              common commitment to <i>sadhana</i>.</p>
            <p>Further on, when I described this grass-roots process of reform, 
              I expanded upon what I felt were the pervading social and individual 
              deficiencies in ISKCON:</p>
            <p>One special advantage to this revolutionary project for the regeneration 
              of ISKCON is that it need not wait on the action of the GBC. It 
              can be initiated in each temple immediately. It can be started by 
              one devotee, and then spread by progression to two, three, and on 
              and on. Thus there can be many centres of reformation, and they 
              will each widen until all of ISKCON is included.</p>
            <p>Any devotee who wants to institute reform must begin with himself. 
              The prerequisite for coming to the <i>madhyama</i> stage is to be 
              a strict follower of the regulative principles of devotional service. 
              Spiritual fellowship cannot flourish if <i>anarthas</i> are not 
              being relentlessly uprooted by daily practice. Therefore, every 
              devotee who wants to help in the reformation of ISKCON must first 
              carefully review his own spiritual condition and his personal devotional 
              practice. If he is careless in observing regulative principles and 
              slack in <i>sadhana</i>, he must immediately take up the process 
              of rectification. This entails attending the complete morning program 
              in all alertness, with especial concentration on attentive, offence-avoiding 
              <i>japa</i>. By this effort, a devotee may quickly remove all his 
              accommodations to sense gratification and undertake the deliberate 
              dismantling of his false ego. A devotee of the reforming party should 
              recognise sense gratification and false ego as the two great impediments 
              to Vaisnava fellowship. They are the mortal enemies of ISKCON, and 
              he should resolve to conquer them.</p>
            <p>Having undertaken whatever personal reformatory measures are required, 
              the reforming devotee should then undertake the rectification of 
              his relationships. Most devotees will discover that few, if any, 
              of their relationships are satisfactory. The devotee will probably 
              see that he has almost no confidential friends, and that he does 
              not and cannot trust most of his associates. He is conscious that 
              many of his associates have made accommodations &#151; sometimes 
              quite extensive &#151; to sense gratification. Indeed, he has participated 
              in many meetings in which the faults and shortcomings of those not 
              present have been thoroughly examined. Yet the established patterns 
              of relationships are such that while everyone is free to talk <i>about</i>, 
              no one is free to talk <i>to</i> them. In this situation, devotees 
              find themselves standing helplessly by as they watch one of their 
              associates sink deeper and deeper into <i>maya</i> until he finally 
              bloops; no one is able to come to his aid. As the failing devotee 
              falls further and further away, the criticism of him intensifies, 
              but no one helps.</p>
            <p>Nor can the devotees work together effectively, because they have 
              no way of working out the inevitable differences that arise in any 
              collective effort. When one devotee transgresses against another, 
              the offended party will either respond in wrath or else retreat 
              into wounded silence (complaining, however, vociferously to others). 
              He does not know how to approach the other devotee and openly resolve 
              their differences. He is unable to reveal his mind without giving 
              offence.</p>
            <p>Under these conditions, a great stockpile of resentment builds 
              up in time, and the atmosphere is filled with sullen undercurrents 
              of hostility and mistrust, relieved only by periodic outbursts of 
              anger. In this uncongenial climate, devotional relations become 
              more and more burdensome, and materialistic people start to seem 
              relatively nice. The devotees find themselves living in deepening 
              isolation from one another, each enthroned in a well-fortified ivory 
              tower of false ego. They learn to get along by avoiding each other. 
              These are some local conditions that arise in the milieu of fratricidal 
              strife.</p>
            <p>I called the finished paper a 'preliminary proposal', and gave 
              it the title 'The Next Step in the Expansion of ISKCON: Ending the 
              Fratricidal War.' My realisations were quite personal; I had conducted 
              no surveys, nor much textual research, on the guru question. So, 
              tentatively, I mailed photocopies to three or four devotees to get 
              their responses. (Remember that at this time &#151; November 1984 
              &#151; facsimile machines were not yet in common use; it was photocopying, 
              then ubiquitous, that carried the reform movement.) What happened 
              next astonished me: within two weeks strong responses &#151; some 
              of them very personal &#151; began flooding in from devotees all 
              over the world. Chain-photocopying had geometrically propagated 
              the paper swiftly throughout ISKCON. I received phone calls from 
              devotees who complained that I had left them off my mailing-list 
              &#151; I had to explain that the paper had published itself.</p>
            <p>Clearly, I had struck a nerve. The response was overwhelmingly 
              favourable. However, Ramesvara Swami, the head of the North American 
              BBT, was outraged, and he charged me with the worst of malefactions: 
              because I was discouraging the devotees, <i>I was hurting book distribution</i>. 
              This I worried about until the Christmas mail delivered a store-bought 
              card from Los Angeles displaying on front the words 'Good Job!' 
              and 'Thank you!' inside. It was signed by Ramesvara Swami's biggest 
              book distributors &#151; 'Mothers Kaumadaki, Jagaddhatri and friends 
              too shy to write their names' &#151; who added the message: 'Dandavats 
              for your "Preliminary Proposal" for ISKCON. At last some hope!!'</p>
            <p>Bahudaka Dasa, the chairman of the North American temple presidents 
              and leader of the reform movement in America, was a little disappointed. 
              He wrote me that:</p>
            <p>We need solid research to understand what should be the role and 
              position of guru. With that paper we can push on strongly for real 
              change. ISKCON as Prabhupada set it up has changed radically and 
              the primary cause is the serious mistakes being made regarding the 
              position of guru. How can we establish the importance of <i>sadhana 
              </i>in our movement when the majority of gurus give the worst example 
              in this regard?</p>
            <p>As Bahudaka wanted, I did go on to write a further paper about 
              the misunderstanding of Prabhupada's order concerning the position 
              of guru in ISKCON. '"Under My Order ...": Reflections on the Guru 
              in ISKCON' (August 1985) became accepted as the position paper of 
              the reform movement, and the paper's thesis helped lead, two years 
              later, to the formal dismantling of the 'zonal <i>acarya</i>' system. 
            </p>
            <p>My investigation of this issue brought home the fact that the difficulties 
              undergone by ISKCON uncannily paralleled those suffered by the Gaudiya 
              Matha after the demise of its founder. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 
              Thakura had appointed no successor to occupy the chair at the head 
              of his institution; instead he ordered the institution to be managed 
              by a 'Governing Body Commission', that is, a board of directors 
              of the kind that runs modern corporate enterprises. ('Governing 
              Body Commission' is in fact the name of the governing board of the 
              British-established Indian Railways.)</p>
            <p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura was attempting to construct a 
              preaching mission effective in the modern, global context. To do 
              this he instituted a collection of reforms that rendered his mission 
              suspect to many formed by and attached to prevailing practices, 
              which they regarded as sanctified by sacred tradition. The idea 
              of a GBC was one such innovation. However, it did not prevail. As 
              Srila Prabhupada recounts it:</p>
            <p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, at the time of his departure, 
              requested all his disciples to form a governing body and conduct 
              missionary activities cooperatively. He did not instruct a particular 
              man to become the next <i>acarya</i>. But just after his passing 
              away, his leading secretaries made plans, without authority, to 
              occupy the post of <i>acarya</i>, and they split into two factions 
              over who the next <i>acarya </i>would be. Consequently, both factions 
              were <i>asara</i>, or useless, because they had no authority, having 
              disobeyed the order of the spiritual master. Despite the spiritual 
              master's order to form a governing body and execute the missionary 
              activities of the Gaudiya Matha, the two unauthorized factions began 
              litigation that is still going on after forty years with no decision. 
              (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila</i> 12.8, purport)</p>
            <p>According to Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami (who discussed 
              this matter during a audio-taped conversation with a group of GBC 
              members on October 17, 1980), a GBC of thirteen members was formed 
              ten days after the departure of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, 
              but Sridhara Maharaja &#151; who would not serve on the body &#151; 
              was dissatisfied with it, and he and some other senior members prevailed 
              upon the Matha to elevate Ananta Vasudeva Dasa, a <i>brahmacari 
              </i>of brilliant scholastic ability who had served as Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati Thakura's secretary, to the position of <i>acarya</i>. 
              In effect, the Matha reverted to an ancient, traditional model of 
              leadership, in which a single guru, recognised by all as possessing 
              exceptional spiritual power (charisma) is elevated above all others 
              to rule autocratically at the seat at the head of the institution. 
              One of Ananta Vasudeva's 'principle supporters', B.R. Sridhara Swami 
              recollects (referring to himself in the first person plural):</p>
            <p>We made him <i>acarya</i>, though a <i>brahmacari</i>, because, 
              next to Prabhupada [Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura], he could 
              satisfy us with the <i>siddhanta</i>, sastric <i>siddhanta</i>, 
              sastric conclusion. He was well versed [in the <i>sastra</i>]. It 
              was universally accepted: Next to Prabhupada, he knows the sastric 
              <i>siddhanta</i>. So we felt indebted to him. And from early time, 
              we thought the next <i>acarya </i>will be he. That was our conviction.</p>
            <p>Two years after the elevation of 'Vasudeva Prabhu', however, someone 
              stumbled across some 'love letters', part of a correspondence between 
              Ananta Vasudeva and a woman; these letters were brought to B.R. 
              Sridhara Swami, who concluded, together with some other senior men, 
              that Ananta Vasudeva could not 'do justice to the seat of our Guru 
              Maharaja' and should step down. Ananta Vasudeva, however, did not 
              agree, and he and his loyal followers squared off with the others 
              in protracted, painful hostilities that included systematic discrimination, 
              much persiflage and on occasion physical assault. Finally, as Sridhara 
              Maharaja put it, 'Prabhupada withdrew from him', and Ananta Vasudeva 
              began to preach against Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura &#151; 
              Sridhara Maharaja says this blasphemy was the result of Ananta Vasudeva's 
              having committed so many offences against devotees &#151; and he 
              left the mission. He gave himself <i>sannyasa</i> in Allahabad, 
              and later took initiation (as Puri Goswami) among the <i>babajis</i> 
              of Radha-kunda &#151; a group highly antagonistic to Bhaktisiddhanta 
              &#151; among whom he continued as leading intellectual light, even 
              though he eventually got married. After his abdication, the Gaudiya 
              Matha fragmented into contending parties over the succession, and 
              the case ended up before the Calcutta High Court for resolution.</p>
            <p>We see that ISKCON is not going through anything new. It faces 
              the same issues that broke apart the Gaudiya Matha. The fact that 
              Bhaktisiddhanta's disciples could not continue their founder's visionary 
              reforms demonstrates first of all the sheer difficulty of the undertaking. 
              It may well take several generations to get it right. The undertaking 
              is to pass on a spiritual tradition in a sound and healthy form, 
              its living force undiminished, into the modern world. This is no 
              small task. Up until now, when the religions of the West have encountered 
              modernity, they have tended either to remain intact by withdrawing 
              into the self-protective shell of fundamentalism, or to become swallowed 
              up and assimilated by the world, to live on only as a few nostalgic 
              gestures. Does a similar fate await Lord Caitanya's movement? The 
              task facing Gaudiya Vaisnavas, it seems to me, is to discover another 
              alternative.</p>
            <p>Awareness of the history of the Gaudiya Matha not only shows us 
              the difficulty of challenge, but it may save us from the same mistakes 
              or at least help us rectify those we have made. Any hope we have 
              of healing fragmentation and isolation depends upon our recognition 
              of past mistakes. At the beginning of the reform movement, I tried 
              to show how, within ISKCON, concealment of failure leads to isolation. 
              This principle holds as much for relations among communities as 
              among individuals. Progress in spiritual life, individually and 
              institutionally, depends first of all on the frank acknowledgement 
              of shortcoming, errors and mistakes. Without that, all 'progress' 
              is mere bluff.</p>
            <p>At a certain time, Germans found it necessary to put themselves 
              through a painful process to which they gave the name <i>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</i> 
              &#151; that is, 'coming to terms with the past', 'past' here referring 
              to the period 1933-45. ISKCON requires its own <i>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</i>. 
              Each devotee needs to undergo it as an individual, and the society 
              needs to undertake it as an institution. It is also a necessity 
              for the various present offshoots and spin-offs of the original 
              Gaudiya Matha. ISKCON is not the only place mistakes get buried. 
              In those quarters there seems to be a reluctance to face up to a 
              historical failure to serve the order of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 
              Thakura.</p>
            <p>The reform movement in ISKCON aimed at establishing the GBC-principle 
              and subordinating initiating gurus to the GBC authority, based on 
              Srila Prabhupada's order. To me, however, the most important element 
              of reform is the personal reform as I envisioned it in my 'preliminary 
              proposal'. And it is this project that has, as you might suspect, 
              proven to be the most intractable.</p>
            <p>For devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement, reform must be 
              a fundamental spiritual practice, inseparable from our cultivation 
              of the holy name. We must accordingly recognise that reform is a 
              never-ending enterprise, our daily work. It should never be neglected, 
              nor should we ever assume that the job is accomplished. Our confession 
              should be perpetual: </p>
            <p align="center"><i>trnad api sunicena taror iva sahisnuna<br>
              </i><i>amanina manadena kirtaniya sada harih</i></p>
            <p>One who thinks himself lower than the grass, who is more tolerant 
              than a tree, and who does not expect personal honour but is always 
              prepared to give all respect to others can very easily always chant 
              the holy name of the Lord. (<i>Sri</i> <i>Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila 
              </i>20.21)</p>
            <p>At the same time, if we show some perseverance in the matter, always 
              begging Krsna to destroy our desires to enjoy independently in this 
              world, Krsna will reciprocate with us and give us guidance from 
              within. In this way, the devotee becomes acquainted with the infinitely 
              caring and carefully guiding presence of Krsna, a presence that 
              becomes the solace of the devotee's heart. And the devotee can progress 
              confidently. The devotee is also empowered to give guidance to others.</p>
            <p>When I became involved with the reform movement, it distressed 
              me to see the number of my revolutionary godbrothers who thought 
              that the problems with ISKCON were due to the fact that other people 
              were not Krsna conscious enough. The other people, in this context, 
              were those who had become the first initiating gurus after Prabhupada. 
              Each of them had been a responsible leader under Prabhupada, and 
              Prabhupada relied much upon them. Prabhupada deeply appreciated 
              them because they had shouldered the burden of so much responsibility 
              on his behalf. Whatever their shortcomings, they were Prabhupada's 
              'best men'. If, in the event, they turned out to be not good enough, 
              then the question I had to ask myself was: 'Why wasn't I any better?' 
              After all, we are told that the spiritual master's mercy is equally 
              available to all disciples, without discrimination. Prabhupada did 
              not play favourites. So the fault was mine: I had every opportunity 
              to be better, but I did not take it. </p>
            <p>I also realised that, despite all their failings, Prabhupada appreciated 
              the service of these people. I should therefore appreciate it as 
              well. And it seemed to me that success in reform of leadership would 
              only come when Krsna became convinced that there were other people 
              who would be as willing to carry the burden of responsibility as 
              those who had failed and who would strive more diligently than they 
              did to become free from impurities. In sum, the personal qualification 
              for reform is: With a firm vow, we in ISKCON have to commit ourselves 
              to (1) purifying ourselves, and (2) accepting responsibility to 
              care for others. I am convinced that any devotee &#151; man or woman, 
              senior devotee or new <i>bhakta</i>, big preacher or humble doorkeeper 
              &#151; can, by taking these two vows, become increasingly empowered 
              by Krsna to save ISKCON. We can begin today.</p>
