            <p><i>In this article, Bhaktavatsala Dasa will discuss what spiritual 
              abuse is, why there is a need for it to be discussed, some dynamics, 
              causes, consequences and suggested solutions. The material in this 
              article is based on research into ISKCON's needs,<a name="101"></a><a href="#01">[1]</a>examination 
              of how other institutions dealt with the problem,<a name="102"></a><a href="#02">[2]</a>some 
              perspectives from the Vaisnava tradition, and solutions that synthesise 
              and reconcile these various approaches.</i></p>
            <p><i> </i>As far as possible I will speak in generic terms so as 
              to avoid getting caught in the issues related to specific examples 
              or areas of abuse. In the process of giving ISKCON Leadership and 
              Management courses, it became apparent that there was a need to 
              address the issues of abuse within the movement. In response I contacted 
              Dhyanakunda-devi Dasi, a clinical psychologist, and together we 
              wrote a seminar on the subject. We delivered it over five days at 
              the ISKCON Convention 1999, at Radhadesh, Belgium. Much of what 
              I write here was delivered as part of that seminar.</p>
            <p><b>What is spiritual abuse? </b></p>
            <p>Our seminar was entitled 'Spiritual Abuse &#151; Symptoms, Prevention 
              and Healing', and although some Vaisnavas might view the term 'spiritual 
              abuse' as a theological oxymoron,<a name="103"></a><a href="#03">[3]</a>we 
              decided to use it since it is an accepted term within the field 
              of abuse counselling.</p>
            <p>In their book, <i>Healing Religious Addiction</i>, the Linns (Dennis, 
              Sheila and Matt Linn) define spiritual abuse quite broadly as denying 
              other's spiritual freedom through claiming that only one's own way 
              to God is valid (The Linns, p. 12). Johnson and Van Vonderen are 
              more specific: 'Spiritual abuse is the mistreatment of a person 
              who is in need of help, support or greater spiritual empowerment, 
              with the result of weakening, undermining or decreasing that person's 
              spiritual empowerment' (Johnson and Van Vonderen, p. 20). For our 
              seminar, we arrived at a working definition to fit our own theological 
              context: </p>
            <p><i>Spiritual abuse is perpetrated when, in the name of spirituality 
              or spiritual authority, the individual's dignity and right to advance 
              through serving Krsna is violated.</i><a name="104"></a><a href="#04">[4]</a></p>
            <p>To help clarify the concept; some testimonies from various sources:</p>
            <p>My bible study leader tells me that I haven't taken on the 'mantle' 
              as spiritual head of my home. I should be praying more, taking <i>authority 
              </i>in the Spirit &#151; then spiritual forces wouldn't be able 
              to attack my family. Then my wife wouldn't be having menstrual problems 
              and my oldest son wouldn't be suffering from asthma. I guess their 
              sickness is my fault. (Johnson and Van Vonderen, p. 21)</p>
            <p>Being forced to defend yourself on the basis of quotes from religious 
              books is very exhausting and discouraging. The whole process demonstrates 
              a lack of emotional expression.You become very afraid and guilty 
              for feeling, especially when those around you feel different. (<i>VOICE,</i> 
              1997, 4.3.2e)<a name="105"></a><a href="#05">[5]</a></p>
            <p>There is a common dynamic in the above examples &#151; the person 
              seeking spiritual guidance, in need of information, dialogue, support, 
              acceptance or counsel, was made to feel that their spirituality 
              was defective. This can impel a person to agree with a particular 
              belief or to feel discouraged from asking legitimate (but potentially 
              awkward) questions. This is the general dynamic. </p>
            <p>Spiritual abuse frequently occurs in conjunction with other forms 
              of abuse &#151; or one could say that other forms of abuse, be they 
              physical, psychological, emotional, sexual or financial, when perpetrated 
              within a spiritual community or society, will have a spiritual component. 
              The abuse is being backed up by authority and power derived from 
              a spiritual institution or teaching. Those abused have had their 
              boundaries beaten down, they have been shamed out of their 'no', 
              had their discrimination clouded by someone else's religious agendas. 
              Spiritual abuse does not refer to simple mistakes of judgement, 
              but to concerted misuse of position or power. The dynamics, causes 
              and consequences of spiritual abuse are relevant to all members 
              of a spiritual society since abuse seems to be an unavoidable reality 
              within any society, and spiritual abuse seems to be programmed into 
              the process of spiritual growth, a point that I will discuss later 
              in this article.</p>
            <p><b>Why spiritual abuse is often hidden or missed</b></p>
            <p>Although the <i>New Christian Dictionary of Ethics and Pastoral 
              Theology </i>defines abuse as 'perversion / misuse of the privilege 
              of caring for another person', it does not list spiritual abuse 
              in its examples of abuse (Atkinson and Field, p. 136), even though 
              in pastoral theology or care it would seem to be an obvious choice. 
              Spiritual abuse is often hidden, overlooked or ignored because it 
              frequently occurs in conjunction with other abuses, and may be overshadowed 
              by the other, more obvious forms.<a name="106"></a><a href="#06">[6]</a> 
              Thus it may happen that the spiritual component becomes minimised, 
              although it is often this element that provides not only the environment, 
              but the leverage, the platform of power, from which the abuse takes 
              place.</p>
            <p>We derive and define our sense of self largely in terms of our 
              belief system (Storr, p. 200). Challenges questioning our belief 
              system scare us because they threaten to shake the self-identity 
              fundamental to our sense of personal security. The abused are afraid 
              of upsetting the apple cart of their own belief system by challenging 
              its champions (their spiritual superiors). Abusers take advantage 
              of their subordinates' fears, hiding behind taboos and holy cows 
              such as tradition, position and etiquette, and casting aspersions 
              on any who challenge them. 'In an abusive system, you are told that 
              you are "the problem" for noticing the problem. That makes it hard 
              to expose the abuse, even after you've left the system.' (Johnson 
              and Van Vonderen, p. 49)</p>
            <p>It is important to discuss the issue of spiritual abuse because 
              it addresses a current need. That this need is also there in ISKCON 
              was not only apparent from the seminars I conducted, and the proliferation 
              of reform movements within or outside of the Society, but in a recent 
              survey, Dr. E. Burke Rochford, Jr. confirmed a general dissatisfaction 
              about the gap between leadership and rank-and-file. In his 'Summary 
              of Major Findings', his first point was: 'There is a striking lack 
              of trust between ISKCON members and the movement's leadership, ... 
              there is a lack of honest open communication between devotees.' 
              (Rochford 1999, p. 17)</p>
            <p>Diminished trust and dysfunctional relationships between authorities 
              and subordinates create an environment in which abuse can flourish. 
              Rochford's other findings suggest to me that spiritual abuse was 
              responsible for a good proportion of the 'striking lack of trust 
              between ISKCON members and the movement's leadership'.<a name="107"></a><a href="#07">[7]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>One of the aims of our seminar, and this article, is to help devotees 
              become more conscious of spiritual abuse, since acknowledgement 
              obviously precedes cure (Stafford and Hodgkinson, pp. 90, 93). Such 
              seminars and articles will increase open discussion in the areas 
              of spirituality, morality, ethics and the rights and responsibilities 
              of members of the Krsna consciousness movement. These discussions 
              not only serve to identify the nature, symptoms and consequences 
              of spiritual abuse, but also begin the process of healing, encouraging 
              devotees to come to terms with possible negative experiences and 
              foster their confidence as individuals and as members of ISKCON. 
              This will ultimately help in making commitments to reduce abuse, 
              within the movement and as individuals.</p>
            <p><b>About abuse dynamics</b></p>
            <p>Abuse can occur in any authority structure or wherever there is 
              an assumption of authority<a name="108"></a><a href="#08">[8]</a> 
              &#151; between, for example; Governing Body Commissioners (GBC, 
              ISKCON's highest management authority) and intermediate levels of 
              management; adult and child; a devotee living in a temple and one 
              in the congregation. I have often heard devotees complaining about 
              spiritual abuse issues as 'the problem with ISKCON', as if such 
              problems were ISKCON- exclusive. Seminar participants expressed 
              great relief to learn that we share our problems with other religious 
              organizations. </p>
            <p>Based on researching problems in other institutions, reactions 
              to our seminars and our experiences in ISKCON, we formulated the 
              following list of dynamics conducive to abuse:</p>
            <p><b>1. Unrealistic evaluation of spiritual acumen </b></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>a) Position/external success = spiritual advancement</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>2. Unrealistic expectations</b></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>a) The myth of the infallible leader</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>b) The myth of the totally surrendered subordinate</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>3. Misapplication of philosophy</b></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>a) Twisting theology or interpreting scripture to suit 
              personal or institutional agendas</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>b) Sweeping problems under the carpet of spiritual catch-phrases</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>4. Coercion through shame and fear</b></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>a) Shaming people into submission and/or silence</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>b) Criticising/humiliating anyone with a different opinion 
              or who notices a problem</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>c) Demonisation, name-calling and fear of ostracism as 
              coercion methods</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>5. Premature transcendence </b></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>a) Elitism and exclusivism as a justification for segregation 
              and prejudice</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>b) Ignoring physical, psychological, emotional or social 
              needs</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> 
            <blockquote>c) Encouraging renunciation far beyond a person's realisation</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Although in the seminar we elaborated on this list with subcategories 
              (Bhaktavatsala Dasa, 1999, pp. 1,2) and discussion, for the purposes 
              of this article I would like to concentrate on two categories that 
              the American Family Foundation (AFF) found to be most important: 
            </p>
            <p>In our research survey of 308 former members from 101 different 
              groups, the highest rated group characteristic was elitism (4.86 
              average out of a possible 5.0 on a 1-5 Likert scale). The second 
              highest rated item was that dissent was not tolerated. One can speculate 
              that elites protect their status by suppressing dissent and disagreement. 
              Therefore, a group trying to avoid spiritual abuse could practice 
              ways of increasing awareness of elitist feelings and ways of responding 
              respectfully to dissenting opinions [our emphasis]. (Langone, 1999) 
            </p>
            <p>We termed these two characteristics 'premature transcendence', 
              and 'coercion through shame and fear'<i> </i>respectively. Because 
              the AFF have related their statistics to religious groups, it would 
              be interesting to research more general statistics on elitism and 
              shame as dynamics of social alienation, to see if these sort of 
              statistics are more widely applicable to social structures.</p>
            <p><b>Premature transcendence </b></p>
            <p>Elitism is generally regarded as a defence mechanism related to 
              underlying feelings of inadequacy (Dixon, p. 202). Many religious 
              traditions have recognised it as an attitude that new converts are 
              prone to adopt. It manifests as a tendency to look down on or criticise 
              others, on the basis of their own, new-found 'superiority'. In <i>Madhurya-kadambini</i>, 
              Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura refers to this phenomenon as 
              <i>utsaha-mayi </i>(Visvanatha, 1993, p. 15): 'A <i>brahmana </i>child, 
              having just begun study of the scriptures, thinks he has immediately 
              become a learned scholar worthy of everyone's praise. Similarly, 
              a person just beginning devotional service may have the audacity 
              to think that he has mastered everything. This is called <i>utsaha-mayi</i>, 
              or filled (puffed-up) with enthusiasm.' St. John of the Cross warns 
              in <i>The Dark Night of the Soul</i> (Backhouse, 1988, p. 7):'But 
              because beginners are imperfect they need to speak of spiritual 
              things in front of others, and even to teach rather than to learn, 
              because they are conceited. In their hearts they condemn those that 
              do not have the devotion they themselves want.' Time and interactions 
              within the world of the unconverted usually temper the zealous fervour 
              of a new convert; if, however, the convert disassociates himself 
              from this world, then that maturation process can be retarded or 
              halted.<a name="109"></a><a href="#09">[9]</a>Isolated from the 
              rest of society, the convert is free to construct a world wherein 
              he is an advanced transcendentalist and all others are very fallen. 
              Such self-righteousness leads to elitism and exclusivism &#151; 
              adequate justification for the segregation and prejudice that alienates 
              inhabitants of the world of the unconverted. </p>
            <p>Living in a 'transcendental bubble', converts ('us') often condemn 
              and reject outsiders ('them'), including family, peers and those 
              with necessary expertise (medical, educational, etc.). Such attitudes 
              may be supported and perpetuated by pejorative jargon &#151; a language 
              of segregation which becomes established and subtly influences all 
              users. In ISKCON the word '<i>karmi</i>' alludes to a non-devotee, 
              a materialistic person. The meaning has become extended to encompass 
              anyone who is not a member of ISKCON (Rasamandala Dasa, pp. 84-6), 
              regardless of their religious or devotional inclinations. Derivative 
              words: <i>karmi</i> world, <i>karmi</i> job, <i>karmi</i> school, 
              <i>karmi</i> bread, <i>karmi</i> clothes &#151; denote the materialistic, 
              contaminated nature of the world of non-devotees. The extremely 
              dualistic perspective of the new convert is also captured within 
              the jargon: Positive examples &#151; devotees are not simply happy, 
              they are 'blissful', similarly, a feast is not delicious, it is 
              'ecstatic'. Negative examples &#151; those who do not concur with 
              our ideology are 'demons' and 'materialists'.</p>
            <p>In the letter quoted in the previous section, Langone hypothesises 
              that leaders might maintain their influence through creating such 
              a dualistic world-view. One could also make a case that such elitism 
              is the result of an unconscious defence mechanism rather than a 
              premeditated tactic. I would suggest individual cases of both possibilities 
              could be found. Whether deliberately orchestrated or naturally occurring, 
              the process of establishing the superiority of one's own group and 
              focussing on an external enemy distracts attention from perpetrators 
              of abuse or internal organisational problems. Creating a fearful 
              image of life outside the transcendental bubble keeps the sheep 
              within the fold, and increases their dependence. On the basis of 
              these ends, which some (leaders or followers) may view as advantageous, 
              some may justify cultivating elitism as a substitute for merit.</p>
            <p>The quest for transcendence is about going beyond the temporal 
              world of material imperfection, and ISKCON, as other religious groups, 
              has the experience of premature transcendentalists considering themselves 
              beyond the constraints of material requirements and ignoring physical, 
              psychological, emotional or social needs.</p>
            <p>[In 1974] <i>sannyasa</i> [the renounced order of life] was a kind 
              of reward for achievement. The number of men initiated into the 
              <i>sannyasa-asrama </i>increased dramatically. A genuine desire 
              for transcendence, often co-mingled with an urge to acquire prestige, 
              position and power within the institution, had propelled most of 
              these young men into rash and improvident heroics. The persistence 
              of desires they could neither acknowledge nor control started to 
              manifest as intolerance and fanaticism ... . As one would expect, 
              over the long run, many of these <i>sannyasis </i>found it impossible 
              to maintain their vows. There was a steady, even growing exodus. 
              In most cases, an extreme sense of disgrace and shame, amplified 
              by the merciless condemnation of the <i>sannyasi</i> community itself, 
              propelled them into exile into the fringe and beyond. (Ravindra 
              Svarupa Dasa, 1994) </p>
            <p>The history of ISKCON provides examples of various forms of self-deception 
              that only became evident when the compounding effects reached a 
              critical stage. The assumption that spiritual advancement can be 
              measured by external renunciation has led to some validating the 
              acceptance of unhealthy levels of self-deprivation in the name of 
              transcendence.</p>
            <p> Authorities have been known to encourage levels of renunciation 
              in their wards that far exceeds the subordinate's realisation (Rasa-mandala 
              Dasa, p. 90). Such authorities could be motivated by the prestige 
              of having highly renounced (thus supposedly advanced) wards, or 
              by the fact that renunciates are obliged to be submissive, and are 
              cheaper to maintain in the short-term. Wards could be motivated 
              by the opportunity to escape their responsibilities (of conditional 
              devotional service<a name="110"></a><a href="#10">[10]</a>) on the 
              pretext of being beyond them.<a href="#11">[11]</a><a name="111"></a> 
            </p>
            <p><b>Coercion through shame and fear</b></p>
            <p>Once an elitist authority structure has developed, or been established, 
              the powers that be may feel the need to protect their elite position. 
              This may be achieved through shame and fear. Followers are coerced 
              to agree, submit, obey &#151; in body and/or mind. It has been a 
              popular allegation that religious practitioners are coerced through 
              mind control,<a name="112"></a><a href="#12">[12]</a>with the terms 
              'brainwashing' and 'snapping' being bandied about by more extreme 
              accusers. Although brainwashing is rarely an issue these days,<a href="#13">[13]</a><a name="113"></a>many 
              still object to the mind control they feel is used as a tool for 
              exploitation within religious groups.<a name="114"></a><a href="#14">[14]</a> 
              In <i>Combating Cult Mind Control</i>, anti-cultist Steven Hassan 
              defines a cult as: 'an exclusive group that exercises negative uses 
              of mind control, which may be understood as a system of influences 
              that disrupts an individual's identity (beliefs, behaviour, thinking 
              and emotions) and replaces it with a new identity.' (Hassan, 1990) 
              Hassan's idea of 'negative mind control' implies the existence of 
              'positive mind control' (presumably such things as army training, 
              Ameri can history lessons and TV News). His definition is dependent 
              on his own personal judgement of what is negative and positive. 
              Rather than losing cognitive autonomy, as these charges of brainwashing 
              imply, victims of abuse are often psychologically manipulated  into 
              relinquishing to their authority, a portion of their judgement and 
              decision-making capacity.</p>
            <p>Shame and fear are the abuser's main weapons of coercion. Shame 
              is used to belittle the abused, and make them feel that their spirituality 
              is defective, or that they are unworthy, stupid, unqualified or 
              in some way inferior. Such humiliation (in the eyes of peers, superiors 
              or self), can undermine self-determination and discrimination, and 
              corner an abused person into submission and silence. Once an authority 
              has demonstrated the consequences of dissent or disobedience, subordinates 
              live in fear of punitive shaming, public censure, stigmatisation, 
              ostracism or demonisation. </p>
            <p>These dynamics do not only occur in a gross Orwellian fashion; 
              dissenters may simply find the focus of the issue being subtly changed: 
              'The issue of which you are complaining is not the problem, <i>you</i> 
              are the problem.' There is an example of a devotee who brought to 
              the atention of one of the temple authorities that an unmarried 
              couple were sharing a room (contravening the <i>asrama </i>rules). 
              The authority responded: 'Well, I am wondering how it is that as 
              a <i>brahmacari</i> [celibate monk], you are so concerned with others' 
              marital affairs.' Which translated as, 'You are supposed to be a 
              celibate, but you are obviously so smitten by lust that you are 
              absorbed in thoughts of others' marital/sexual affairs.' In this 
              way the devotee found himself suddenly 'on trial' for having raised 
              a legitimate issue. </p>
            <p>The weapons of fear and shame can be very effective in enforcing 
              a regime or a social code of silence which has the short-term effect 
              of protecting the status quo (and thus the elite) and establishing 
              an illusion that there is total consensus and no problems (Ravindra 
              Svarupa Dasa, 1996, p. 81). In such an environment problems are 
              only discussed as a means of finding someone to blame so that the 
              leadership is vindicated. Norman Dixon pointed out the unfortunate 
              consequences of such scapegoating: </p>
            <p>It is a sad feature of authoritarian organisations that their nature 
              inevitably militates against the possibility of learning from experience 
              through the apportioning of blame. The reason is not hard to find. 
              Since authoritarianism is itself the producer of psychological defences, 
              authoritarian organisations are past masters of deflecting blame. 
              They do so by denial, by rationalisation, by making scapegoats, 
              or by some mixture of the three. However it is achieved, the net 
              result is that no real admission of failure or incompetence is made 
              by those who are really responsible; hence nothing can be done about 
              preventing recurrence. (Dixon, 1994, pp. 43-4)</p>
            <p>Such silence is comparable to a rabbit's defence mechanism of closing 
              its eyes when attacked. It allows problems to go unchallenged and 
              escalate to chronic, destructive proportions. Another consideration 
              that prevents discussing problems is the opinion that talking about 
              problems will make the movement or religion look bad in others' 
              eyes. </p>
            <p>An unwillingness to acknowledge or value different opinions is 
              reflected in the absence of a grievance procedure. This lacking 
              subtly forbids dissent &#151; 'My way or the highway!' demands: 
              'Become a yes-man or leave.' Secrecy and censored information flow 
              are the allies of those unable to live up to their own standards, 
              who need to hide the facts and propagate a myth of success.</p>
            <p><b>Reasons for abuse</b></p>
            <p>Going through the above-mentioned list of dynamics in our seminar 
              evoked some disturbing accounts from the devotee audience. Hearing 
              these descriptions caused many to wonder how these abuses could 
              have been carried out by devotees &#151; spiritual seekers striving 
              for divine consciousness? What is going wrong? What could motivate 
              them to such inappropriate actions? Of course the adherent of any 
              religion could look at internal problems (past or present) and ask 
              the same question. It is, in a sense, to be expected that there 
              are problems. The US writer James Baldwin wrote: 'The price one 
              pays for pursuing any profession or calling is an intimate knowledge 
              of its ugly side.' The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> teaches that every endeavour 
              is tainted by fault, just as every fire produces smoke (Prabhupada, 
              1985, p. 832). Srila Prabhupada also warned his followers to have 
              realistic expectations:</p>
            <p>People should not expect that even in the Krishna Consciousness 
              Society there will be Utopia. Because devotees are persons, therefore 
              there will always be some lacking.<a name="115"></a><a href="#15">[15]</a></p>
            <p>One thing, we can never expect to find any kind of utopia, even 
              in the spiritual world. Wherever there are persons there are bound 
              to be differences, so we should not expect any kind of perfect arrangement, 
              especially here in the material world.<a name="116"></a><a href="#16">[16]</a></p>
            <p>Accepting that there are always differences, and hence always problems, 
              does not justify the occurrence of spiritual abuse, but it helps 
              us come to terms with the existence of such abuse within a spiritual 
              society. Looking in more detail at reasons for abuse may offer clues 
              to prevention. </p>
            <p><b>Common pitfalls of spiritual life</b></p>
            <p>When we asked our seminar participants for suggested reasons for 
              spiritual abuse, their first suggestion was 'impurity'. In Vaisnava 
              terminology such impurities are known as <i>anarthas</i>, or unwanted 
              things in the heart. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the great Vaisnava 
              scholar of the 17th century, concurred that certain dynamics and 
              attitudes conducive to abuse arise almost unavoidably, as if programmed 
              into the process of spiritual growth:</p>
            <p>... it is well known that the very nature of <i>bhakti </i>is to 
              be attractive, thus many people become attracted to the devotee, 
              the abode of <i>bhakti </i>... . <i>Bhakti </i>produces much opportunity 
              for material gain, worship, and position (<i>labha, puja, pratistha</i>). 
              These are weeds around the creeper of <i>bhakti</i>. (Visvanatha, 
              1993, p. 17) </p>
            <p>Next are the <i>anarthas </i>arising from <i>bhakti</i>. As many 
              weeds grow along with the main plant, along with <i>bhakti </i>appear 
              wealth and other facilities, worship and respect by others, and 
              a comfortable position and fame (<i>labha, puja, pratistha</i>). 
              These weeds grow powerful and overwhelm the devotee with their influences. 
              (Visvanatha, 1993, p. 27)</p>
            <p>Excessive striving for, and attainment of, fame and worship (<i>puja</i>) 
              produces elitism. Similarly, an obsession with distinction and position 
              (<i>pratistha</i>) leads to authoritarianism, and greed for material 
              profit (<i>labha</i>) leads to exploitation. Elitism, authoritarianism 
              and exploitation are characteristics that arise from these false 
              motivations, or 'weeds' in the heart (<i>labha, puja, pratistha</i>). 
              According to the Thakura, they are destructive to spiritual life, 
              but to be expected. These three are usually found intertwined together, 
              and those infected may abuse others in order to protect their image, 
              keep funds coming in, maintain their position in the pecking order, 
              and build religious kingdoms to bolster their own image of themselves 
              as spiritualists.</p>
            <p><b>Conditioning</b></p>
            <p>Those who 'grew up' in an abusive environment are likely to perpetuate 
              the paradigm they know &#151; today's victims become tomorrow's 
              abusers. A collection of similarly conditioned individuals creates 
              a supportive corporate culture, an environment conducive to abuse. 
              Certain individuals carry within them the seeds for abuse either 
              as 'perpetrators' or 'victims' in the form of prior circumstances 
              or psychological disposition (Stafford, pp. 33-51).</p>
            <p><b>Lack of training</b></p>
            <p>It is said that poverty brings out the worst in people. Leaders 
              thrust into positions beyond their qualification, appointed by default 
              or elimination, may be poverty-stricken in terms of leadership knowledge, 
              skills and experience. Untrained and over-challenged, some leaders 
              may resort to authoritarianism to compensate for their deficient 
              training. Authoritarianism often seems cheap and easy, but is primitive 
              and costly in terms of initiative, innovation (Dixon, p. 267) and 
              genuine commitment &#151; it may elicit initial obedience, out of 
              fear of potentially adverse consequences, but the commitment is 
              superficial, and efforts may turn to sabotage when 'no one is looking' 
              or when the threat is no longer present.</p>
            <p>A lack of spiritual training may lead to the type of premature 
              transcendentalism wherein aspiring spiritualists assume that their 
              spiritual practices will also tend to their physical, psychological, 
              emotional or social needs (Dhyanakunda-devi Dasi, 1999). Thus they 
              may continue for years with unresolved personal issues (psychological, 
              emotional, interpersonal, etc.) thinking that external rites alone 
              will carry them beyond these issues. </p>
            <p><b>Institutional interpretation</b></p>
            <p>Some see religious organisations in general as havens for abuse 
              (Winebrenner, p. 26). Speaking specifically about child abuse, E. 
              Burke Rochford, Jr. has pronounced such abuse and religion to be 
              mutually attractive (Rochford, 1998, p. 43). The mutual attraction 
              between rigid religious authority structures and certain compulsive 
              character disorders has also been documented in writings on religious 
              addiction and codependence (Dhyanakunda-devi Dasi, 1999; Stafford 
              p. 85). As Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura and St. John of the Cross 
              have warned us, the path of spiritual advancement is beset with 
              traps, traps that can set a traveller up for spiritual abuse as 
              a perpetrator, victim or both. Hierarchical authority structures, 
              absolute teachings and requirements of submission make religious 
              organisations particularly fertile grounds for abuse of various 
              descriptions, all of which will most likely contain a component 
              of spiritual abuse. Thus religious institutions are intrinsically 
              susceptible to spiritual abuse.</p>
            <p>Persons who are prepared to take a less trodden path and commit 
              themselves to a high level of participation in a religious organisation 
              often display above-average idealism. Young idealists may also be 
              naive, but naivety is not confined to the young. On occasions I 
              have encountered what I would consider extreme naivety in individuals 
              that hold important leadership positions.<a name="117"></a><a href="#17">[17]</a>The 
              path to hell is paved with good intentions and well-intended assumptions 
              about others' character and competence. Thus those committed to 
              a high ideal within the context of a religious movement may find 
              it difficult to accept that leaders within that framework are guilty 
              of acts that contravene that ideal.</p>
            <p>Some unhealthy dynamics within ISKCON can be better understood 
              if we look at the circumstances under which the movement began and 
              developed. Srila Prabhupada viewed the West as a bastion of materialism, 
              a hostile environment (Prabhupada, 1978, p. 230). He often compared 
              the effort to preach in such circumstances to a military campaign. 
            </p>
            <p>Success or failure has no meaning for a pure devotee because he 
              is a soldier in the field. Preaching the cult of devotional service 
              is something like declaring war against materialistic life. (Prabhupada, 
              1987, Vol. 2, p. 473)</p>
            <p>When the soldiers risk their lives on the battlefield, the government 
              is very much inclined to give them all facilities in their work, 
              even the citizens may be deprived of their comforts. So Krsna takes 
              special appreciation for His devotees who are engaged in risking 
              for His preaching work, and He will give you special care and guidance 
              at all times because you are sincerely trying to serve Him in this 
              way. (Srila Prabhupada, quoted in Kurma Dasa, p. 218)</p>
            <p>He adopted a mode that he felt addressed this situation:</p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada's success in establishing a beachhead in the counterculture 
              soon produced problems within the movement ... . Srila Prabhupada 
              had constructed his movement out of dubious raw material. He was 
              convinced that his efforts were a matter of spiritual life or death, 
              and he was animated by a sense of extreme urgency. In a raging storm 
              one must construct a shelter out of whatever comes to hand. Indeed, 
              Srila Prabhupada was well aware of the defects of his handiwork. 
              (Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, 1994)</p>
            <p>Extending this often-used analogy, comparing ISKCON to a country 
              at war may give some insight into how certain dynamics arose and 
              were tolerated, accepted or rationalised. The following is a list 
              of extraordinary measures sometimes established during wartime.<a name="118"></a><a href="#18">[18]</a></p>
            <p>A country at war declares a state of emergency and can have:</p>
            <p>. Authoritarian management structure &#151; martial rule.</p>
            <p>. Normal democratic functions (such as referendums) suspended.</p>
            <p>. The leaders are the biggest heroes, usually veterans.</p>
            <p>. Law and order is maintained with greater force.</p>
            <p>. The biggest offence is treason; traitors are killed, their deaths 
              advertised.</p>
            <p>. 'Us and them' mentality.</p>
            <p>. Strong anti-foe propaganda.</p>
            <p>. Individuals are expendable, even big leaders.</p>
            <p>. It is normal to have casualties, suffering and amputees.</p>
            <p>. Risky campaigns are undertaken, opportunities for instant glory.</p>
            <p>. Victories are exaggerated.</p>
            <p>. Failures are covered up and minimised.</p>
            <p>. Everyone is a soldier; others who stay back are cowards.</p>
            <p>. Training means the smashing of independent spirit and enforcing 
              a state of self-alienation.</p>
            <p>. Promotion happens quickly.</p>
            <p>. Education, culture and arts are stifled.</p>
            <p>. Social development is stifled.</p>
            <p>. There are many austerities imposed upon the citizens, who do 
              not protest.</p>
            <p>. Women and children are working in munitions factories etc.</p>
            <p>. Normal industrial worker's rights are curtailed.</p>
            <p>According to this interpretation of the movement's history (whether 
              or not it is justifiable), Srila Prabhupada established ISKCON in 
              an emergency mode. The movement's interpretation of that mode resulted 
              in the instigation and enforcement of many of the above tactics, 
              notably in the 1970s and early 1980s. Abuses carried out in the 
              name of expediency or pragmatic preaching strategies are at least 
              understandable from the perspective of a country at war. But as 
              with any war there are casualties, and ISKCON has had its fair share 
              in the form of devotees who left feeling disgruntled and alienated. 
              (Rasa-mandala Dasa, pp. 85-6)</p>
            <p><b>Consequences of the resulting alienation </b></p>
            <p>Alienation is an emotional state with which most are familiar and 
              try to avoid. Humans are social animals and are especially gregarious 
              when it comes to religion. The sense of belonging that comes through 
              acceptance by a group provides psychological and emotional security. 
              To feel rejected by social peers is traumatic and when coupled with 
              excommunication, an alienated reject may feel forsaken by God as 
              well. Abusers take advantage of people's natural fear of alienation 
              &#151; through this fear those who are abused are compelled to obey 
              and conform, at risk of being ostracised. Being banished can take 
              two forms, the non-conformists can be officially cast out, or simply 
              made to feel like outcastes to the point where they leave of their 
              own accord. The second variant is more common in ISKCON. Non-conformists 
              may be labelled rebels or 'fringies' (those on the fringe of spiritual 
              life; Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, 1994), and their rebellion against 
              the authorities seen as an expression of the original rebellion 
              against Krsna that landed them in the material world. The Vaisnava 
              scriptures recommend avoiding the association of materially minded 
              people (Prabhupada, 1975, p.13). Stigmatised as antagonists, outcastes 
              will soon feel alienated and antagonistic. (Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, 
              1994)</p>
            <p>Rejection and alienation generally evoke two kinds of emotions: 
              those directed towards oneself (emotions related to a loss of self-esteem, 
              for example, inadequacy and humiliation), and emotions (such as 
              resentment and anger) directed towards those perceived to be causing 
              the alienation. Initial enthusiasm, naive submission or a psychological 
              predisposition on the part of the abused (Oaks 1997; p. 124, Dhyanakunda-devi 
              Dasi, 1999) may pave the way for abuse (possibly evoking feelings 
              from the first set of emotions), but if abuse is ongoing, then the 
              abused may be pushed over the tolerance threshold, and come under 
              the sway of the second set of emotions. These emotions will most 
              likely be translated into actions such as the abused disassociating 
              from the institution.</p>
            <p>Some victims will not want to associate with anyone representing 
              religion or spirituality &#151; 'A cat that sits on a hot stove 
              lid won't ever sit on a hot stove lid again. But it probably won't 
              sit on a cold stove lid either' (Mark Twain). People generally seek 
              out like-minded company, and we have seen that those 'burnt' by 
              mistreatment within ISKCON often find other such victims with whom 
              to commiserate, expostulate and agitate. Well trained in finding 
              a philosophical explanation (or justification) for everything (in 
              preference to acknowledging the emotional issues), such congregations 
              may come up with philosophical explanations for their enmity towards 
              the movement that they felt betrayed their trust. I am not claiming 
              that everyone who ever left ISKCON feeling disgruntled is a victim 
              of abuse, but some certainly were.</p>
            <p>Presently a number of former ISKCON members are attacking the movement 
              in the name of some philosophical alternative. There are groups 
              and individuals pushing for reform, others have made the total destruction 
              of ISKCON a major agenda in their lives &#151; publishing sensational 
              books, proliferating angry papers and setting up vindictive web-sites. 
              I am not claiming that all antagonistic, ISKCON-derived splinter 
              groups are simply assemblages of individuals reacting to the abuses 
              they suffered in the movement, projecting the problem on the entire 
              institution. The purpose of this article is not to discuss the legitimacy 
              of the various grievances, but the nature and sheer volume of grievances 
              would suggest that there are legitimate grievances at the institutional 
              level. It is my observation that there are groups or individuals 
              whose, ostensibly philosophical, complaints reveal so much emotion 
              that it seems as if the real solution lies in counselling and reconciliation 
              rather than philosophical debate. </p>
            <p>By what some would describe as a sacrificing of individual care 
              for institutional needs (Rochford, 1999, p. 17), ISKCON has created 
              a significant force working towards the disruption or fragmentation 
              of the institution. Canakya Pandita, the pre-Christian Indian political 
              expert, warned of this social mechanism:</p>
            <p>By the destruction of the welfare and security of the people due 
              to the negligence and laziness of the ruler, impoverishment, avarice, 
              and discontent are produced in the people. Impoverished people become 
              avaricious, and avaricious people become discontented. Discontented 
              people go over to the enemy or destroy the ruler themselves. (<i>Artha-sastra</i> 
              144-7, in Subramanian, p. 167)</p>
            <p>Apart from spiritual consequences,<a name="119"></a><a href="#19">[19]</a> 
              spiritual abuse sets off a chain reaction of many obvious negative 
              repercussions. It results in short- and long-term suffering for 
              the victim as well as crippled spiritual, social, institutional 
              and personal growth. It also frustrates and undermines efforts to 
              bring new people into contact with Krsna consciousness, gives fuel 
              to our adversaries and creates new enemies. </p>
            <p><b>Solutions</b></p>
            <p>Having looked at the dynamics, causes and consequences of spiritual 
              abuse, I would like to return to the causes we mentioned, and suggest 
              some solutions. </p>
            <p><i>Institutional interpretation</i></p>
            <p>Comparing the movement's beginnings to a country under martial 
              law gave insight into some of the attitudes and circumstances that 
              allowed dynamics conducive to abuse to develop within ISKCON. It 
              might be useful for members of ISKCON to examine current modes of 
              activity in the light of this analogy and identify areas where things 
              are still managed as in a country at war. For this purpose it would 
              be of value to put Srila Prabhupada's instructions within a historical 
              framework, identifying which are appropriate for war mode and which 
              for peace. In order to do this properly, ISKCON needs to write and 
              study its own history, otherwise the context and significance of 
              Srila Prabhupada's various instructions will be lost (Hopkins, p. 
              6). </p>
            <p><i>Lack of Training</i></p>
            <p>Systematic education will go a long way to counteracting spiritual 
              abuse caused by naivety, over-idealism and a lack of training. Sefton 
              Davies recommended in his article on ISKCON management: 'Where officers 
              are not performing as required ... training is needed and ISKCON 
              needs to establish orderly procedures for this' (Davies, p. 22). 
              Leaders need to be equipped with knowledge, skills and values so 
              that they can utilise legitimate forms of authority rather than 
              subtle or gross forms of coercion. The establishment of standardised 
              accreditation for leadership qualifications will help establish 
              a leadership ethos that will inhibit abuse. Increasing competence 
              will reduce reliance on authority based on elitism rather than merit, 
              or, as Srila Prabhupada put it, 'Impressive, not repressive, that 
              is the system ... .'<a name="120"></a><a href="#20">[20]</a></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the issue of spiritual abuse is already the 
              subject of a seminar. It is also incorporated into ISKCON Leadership 
              and Management training, and will be part of the Ministerial Studies 
              Course currently under development. Dhyanakunda-devi Dasi is currently 
              writing a book on self-help and counselling, specifically aimed 
              at addressing the needs of devotees.</p>
            <p><i>Conditioning</i></p>
            <p>As mentioned, today's victims become tomorrow's abusers, but breaking 
              the cycle of abuse from individual to individual is a task that 
              cannot be tackled by legislation and education alone. Individual 
              counselling and reconciliation is being taken up within ISKCON, 
              mainly for victims of child abuse.<a name="121"></a><a href="#21">[21]</a> 
              Recognising and addressing cases of spiritual abuse would help leaders 
              and followers trapped within the vicious cycle raise awareness and 
              decrease the likelihood of recurrence. </p>
            <p>Introducing more thorough enrolment or admission procedures into 
              ISKCON <i>asramas</i> would help identify persons with existing, 
              unresolved emotional, social or psychological issues that predispose 
              them to abuse (as either abuser or abused). It needs to be made 
              clear to people moving into the <i>asramas </i>what they can expect 
              in terms of facilities, apart from those necessary for their spiritual 
              education. The time frame and conditions of their stay need to be 
              defined, too, so that the <i>asrama </i>is not exploited by those 
              simply hoping to shirk responsibilities. Leaders should know whereto 
              to refer people experiencing disruptive emotional, social or psychological 
              difficulties. Leadership duties need to be properly defined, and 
              there need to be appropriate screening procedures for positions 
              of responsibility.</p>
            <p><i>Common pitfalls in spiritual life (elitism)</i></p>
            <p>The main characteristic we looked at in our seminars was elitism 
              leading to a lack of trust and honest open communication between 
              ISKCON members and the movement's leadership. Traditionally, old 
              cultures had institutions especially designed to protect leaders 
              from elitist feelings. Kings often kept jesters &#151; the only 
              persons allowed to openly criticise and ridicule them. In Roman 
              times, when a commander led a victory procession through Rome, amidst 
              the adulation and cheering crowds, he would have a servant on his 
              chariot whisper into his ear: 'Remember, man, that thou art mortal.' 
              Both leaders and followers need to be reminded that they are mere 
              mortals, and cultivate an attitude of mutual appreciation for spiritual 
              achievements as well as human vulnerability. Lauding other devotees 
              for their supposed infallibility, mystic powers, divine descent 
              etc., is a precursor for abuse, as is setting leaders far above 
              others through allocation of exalted rank or extraordinary privileges. 
              A true leader is not reliant on such trappings:</p>
            <p> In the life of the cloister ... there are still to be found age-old 
              rituals governing the etiquette of superiors, involving demands 
              of respect from subjects, secretiveness, manifestations of superiority, 
              appeals of superiors to a higher wisdom, displays of condescension, 
              etc. All this should gradually be permitted to wither away. Superiors 
              should cast a long and quiet glance at the world around them: those 
              who are truly powerful and influential, who receive a great deal 
              of unquestioning obedience, place no value on ceremonial of this 
              sort. (Rahner, pp. 202-3)</p>
            <p>Gaudiya Vaisnavism places great importance on humility. It is one 
              of the twenty-six distinguishing qualities of a devotee. One of 
              six essential tenets of the Gaudiya tradition recommends that one 
              should be 'in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than 
              a straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, 
              devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer 
              all respects to others' (Prabhupada, 1989, Canto 6, p. 195). It 
              is also said that a devotee counts himself as the least of all entities 
              (Sarasvati, 1987, p. 284) and that the idea that he should be the 
              master of other devotees leads to hell (Sarasvati, 1989, p. 286). 
              These attitudes, conducive with graciously accepting honest appraisal, 
              are considered signs of spiritual advancement. </p>
            <p>Excessive praise and no exposure to critical feedback are proven 
              ways to make even the best leader lose contact with reality and 
              ultimately falter. If the message from the followers is not just 
              'You have not made any mistakes' but 'You cannot possibly make any 
              mistakes.' then it is not surprising that such leaders lose touch 
              with the world around them. Many, if not most pastors receive messages 
              from their congregation that signal: 'Because you're the pastor, 
              you need to look good, never struggle, always know the answer, and 
              never be wrong.' To succumb to those 'false needs' is to let yourself 
              become trapped in a double life and double talk ... . When image 
              is everything, when 'how things look' is what matters, spiritual 
              abuse is the next step, because you cannot help but demand performance 
              from others when you are working so hard yourself. (Johnson, Van 
              Vonderen, pp. 128, 133) </p>
            <p>Abuse comes as the logical consequence of followers having unrealistic 
              expectations of the leaders and failing to offer them adequate feedback. 
            </p>
            <p>ISKCON needs to develop and systemise its culture of feedback &#151; 
              through learning how to better offer, accept and act upon helpful, 
              respectful critical feedback. The Vedic literature provides evidence 
              that even the greatest of kings accepted feedback from the lowliest 
              of subjects.<a name="122"></a><a href="#22">[22]</a> Scriptural 
              aphorisms and moral teachings confirm the importance of feedback:</p>
            <p><i>Canakya-sutra </i>557-8: Inaccessible rulers destroy the people. 
              Very accessible rulers please the people. (Subramanian, p. 84)</p>
            <p><i>Artha-sastra </i>34: An inaccessible ruler is made to do the 
              opposite of what ought or ought not to be done by those surrounding 
              him. (Subramanian, p. 148)</p>
            <p><i>Artha-sastra </i>217: No one should be disrespected. Everyone's 
              opinion should be heard. The wise one should utilise even a child's 
              sensible words. (Subramanian, p. 178)</p>
            <p>Most corporations have systems in place to ensure that their executives 
              receive regular assessment and feedback on the performance of their 
              responsibilities. This may consist of written and/or verbal feedback 
              between peers, as well as between higher and lower levels of the 
              managerial hierarchy. Such appraisal can only be really meaningful 
              if responsibilities are defined, becoming dependent on precise job 
              descriptions (as mentioned earlier). Feedback allows workers to 
              derive satisfaction and validation for what they have done well, 
              and obtain constructive suggestions on how to improve. A functioning 
              grievance procedure providing neutral, confidential arbitration 
              is also an essential part of any organisation. </p>
            <p>Some companies conduct a leaving interview wherein persons leaving 
              the company, under whatever circumstances, are interviewed and asked 
              their honest opinion of what is right or wrong with the company. 
              This not only gives the employer the chance to hear what is really 
              on the mind of the departing worker, but it gives the workers a 
              chance to get things off their chest, and feel that they've been 
              heard. Regular, formal assessment will help prepare devotees for 
              non-formal types of feedback that goes beyond execution of duty.</p>
            <p>Considering that not a blade of grass moves without the sanction 
              of the Lord, devotees should also learn how to accept and evaluate 
              feedback that does not appear helpful or respectful &#151; appreciating 
              that Krsna sanctioned the feedback. In a society free of subtle 
              or gross recriminations for honest feedback, truth, justice and 
              spiritual growth will hopefully prevail. </p>
            <p><b>Concluding thoughts</b></p>
            <p>Some accuse religions of demanding unquestioning obedience. It 
              was reassuring to see the degree to which the Vaisnava tradition 
              stresses critical questioning and self-enquiry and shuns blind following. 
              I feel sure that further research in this field would yield insights 
              that could prove valuable in avoiding some of the unhealthy dynamics 
              described in this article.</p>
            <p>Looking at spiritual abuse within ISKCON has sometimes been disconcerting. 
              But it was very encouraging, as well as ironic, that the amount 
              of openness and support I received throughout (institutionally as 
              well as from individual devotees) almost belied the subject matter. 
              There was no wall of silence, and the devotees were willing to discuss 
              the subject; however, there was an uncomfortable feeling that they 
              and ISKCON were being challenged. I was reminded of the work of 
              the physicist Ilya Prigogine, who won a Nobel prize for his theory 
              of 'dissipative structures', part of which contends that friction 
              is a fundamental property of nature and nothing grows without it, 
              neither mountains, pearls nor people. He saw the quality of fragility, 
              the capacity to fail, as an essential prerequisite to growth. Structures 
              at any level &#151; molecular, physical, psychological, social or 
              institutional &#151; that are insulated from disturbance are also 
              insulated from change and thus doomed to stagnation. Or, in sporting 
              terms &#151; no pain, no gain. ISKCON is fighting to continue despite 
              many setbacks. </p>
            <p>I see many individuals and departments within and associated with 
              the movement, pushing for positive change. Although, as always, 
              there are those who resist change, it seems to me that they are 
              outnumbered by devotees enthusiastically embracing reform.</p>
            <p>We cannot change what has happened, but we can decide how we react 
              to it. As instances of abuse within ISKCON come to light, some react 
              by distancing themselves from an institution that they see as having 
              (unwittingly) nurtured abuse and abusers. To blame an institution 
              such as ISKCON seems to ignore the fact that it is made up of volunteers, 
              who have, consciously or not, willingly or not, participated in 
              mistreatment and thus share some responsibility. Taking responsibility 
              for participation on whatever level enables devotees to take a serious 
              look at the mistakes; otherwise they may not get beyond finger-pointing 
              and laying blame. Bhaktivinode Thakura suggests that rather than 
              abandoning the present structure, we should aim at righting the 
              wrongs:</p>
            <p>'Begin anew', says the critic, 'because the old masonry does not 
              answer at present. Let the old author be buried because his time 
              is gone.' These are shallow expressions. Progress certainly is the 
              law of nature and there must be corrections and developments with 
              the progress of time. But progress means going further or rising 
              higher.<a name="123"></a><a href="#23">[23]</a></p>
            <p>Anyone who interacts with ISKCON as a community of devotees rather 
              than a faceless institution will have the opportunity to contribute 
              to the growth that comes from addressing past mistakes. In our seminars 
              we have found devotees more than willing to commit to change &#151; 
              which gives us ample reason for optimism.</p>

              We wanted to know if more money could go into direct ministries, 
              benevolence, things like that. When I asked some questions at the 
              elders' meeting - boy did the room get icy. Later I was told to 
              stop trying to create a faction in the church.' (Johnson and VanVonderen,

            <p>'Our church has gotten into this heavy emphasis on home schooling 
              and having big families. Also on women wearing head coverings to 
              show they're in submission &#151; and no makeup. Eventually it came 
              out. Our best friend told us we weren't spiritual because our kid 
              is in public school, and I'm "of the world" because I wear eyeshadow 
              and lipstick.' (Johnson and VanVonderen, pp. 21-2)</p>

            <p><a name="10"></a>[10] The Vaisnava tradition teaches that looking 
              after one's own (and one's dependant's) material needs is a form 
              of <i>bhakti </i>(devotional service) and not simply an activity 
              of illusion (<i>maya</i>). 'When a living entity is conditioned, 
              he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other 
              is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the 
              rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, 
              even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, 
              and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living 
              entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged 
              in Krsna consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has 
              activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are 
              [&nbsp;]performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically 
              called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes 
              devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the 
              body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these 
              activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a 
              devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could 
              disrupt his wholesome condition.' (Prabhupada, 1985, p. 449)<br>
