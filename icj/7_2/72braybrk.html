            <p><b>God's love has no limit</b> </p>
            <p>Father Murray Rogers, a pioneer of Christian-Hindu dialogue, told 
              me when I visited his ashram in India more than thirty years ago, 
              that the 'external' dialogue has to be matched by an 'internal' 
              dialogue. In 'external' dialogue you learn about the faith of others 
              and share your own, whereas in 'internal' dialogue your reflect 
              on what you have learned in communion with the Lord. How does the 
              faith of the other compare with your own faith? Where is there disagreement? 
              Where does it correct your own misunderstanding? This 'internal' 
              dialogue is also a necessary task for a faith community. Do others 
              have a genuine experience of the Divine? If so, can one claim for 
              one's own faith a monopoly of the truth?</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been considerable discussion among Christians 
              about the theological basis for dialogue &#151; perhaps because 
              many Christians want to move away from an exclusive position. There 
              has been less discussion among Hindus &#151; perhaps because many 
              Hindus, as I was told when I first visited India more than thirty 
              years ago, believe that all religions are the same, or at least 
              paths up the same mountain. If that is the case, differences are 
              only superficial and there is no urgency for dialogue, because questions 
              of truth are not at stake. ISKCON, however, regards 'love of a Supreme 
              personal God' to be the highest form of religious expression. Whilst 
              respectful of other positions, once you recognise one way as 'the 
              highest form of religious expression', you have the possibility 
              of disagreement and also of dialogue about the truth.</p>
            <p>The ISKCON document, 'ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in 
              God' is, therefore, a valuable and important document. It is first 
              of all an internal reflection of the ISKCON community and, as it 
              says, will provide members with 'clear principles, guidelines and 
              perspectives for relationships with members of other faith communities'. 
              It is also a significant document to members of other faiths who 
              participate in dialogue with members of ISKCON. There are many motivations 
              for, and approaches to, dialogue and it is helpful when participants 
              clarify their approach as this ISKCON document does. This is particularly 
              the case as, initially at least, ISKCON was seen as a proselytising 
              body keen to recruit new members.</p>
            <p>Part Two of the document addresses the issue of 'Dialogue and Mission'. 
              When A.C. Bhaktivedanta first registered ISKCON, he said its primary 
              aim was 'to systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society 
              at large'. It is clear that he did not claim a monopoly on the truth. 
              It is good, however, that this is now made clear in an official 
              statement as some of his first followers may not have had this breadth 
              of vision. Indeed, it is a puzzle to any new believer why the amazing 
              truth that he or she has discovered is not equally apparent to everyone 
              else. The early Christians could not understand why the good news 
              of Jesus was not as self-evident to others as it was to them. They 
              felt that they had been specially chosen to receive 'the secret 
              of the kingdom of God' (Mark 4,11). They felt that others, who rejected 
              their message, were blind, wilfully disobedient, wicked or even 
              'children of the devil'. The ISKCON statement refers to a passage 
              in the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>that says the neophyte &#151; or 
              new believer &#151; usually expresses the sentiments of fanaticism 
              and exclusivism. The new truth is so amazing that everything else 
              must be wrong. The mature devotee, however, recognises other devotees 
              by the quality of their lives. He or she does not judge them by 
              religious affiliation. This liberating discovery can, however, be 
              difficult if one's fellow believers are still at an immature and 
              exclusive stage of discipleship. Wesley Ariarajah, who did much 
              to develop the dialogue programme of the World Council of Churches, 
              tells in his new book <i>Not Without My Neighbour</i>[1], which 
              arrived in the same post as the <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i>, 
              of his childhood in Sri Lanka, where he grew up with devout Hindu 
              neighbours. 'I was aware ... that their prayer life was for them 
              profoundly meaningful. Perhaps what impressed me most was that their 
              prayer life appeared to bear fruits.' Yet he had to listen to 'hard-nosed' 
              gospel &#151; preachers who described Hindus as 'idol-worshippers' 
              bound for hell, while Christians were destined for heaven. 'It was 
              inconceivable to me; it was clearly unfair. I wouldn't want to be 
              in a heaven where our neighbours were not.' Meeting in friendship 
              with sincere members of other faiths shatters an exclusive theology.</p>
            <p>The ISKCON statement affirms a mature relationship to people of 
              other faiths. It is respectful of those who do not share belief 
              in a supreme personal God, and welcoming to those who do. It recognises 
              the need for people of faith to work together for a better world.</p>
            <p>The <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>also recognises a third stage. 'The 
              advanced devotee sees all living beings as eternal servants of Krsna 
              and treats them as such. He or she will have no interest in sectarian 
              designations of race, caste, sex or religion.' This was the awareness 
              of Francis Younghusband, who founded the World Congress of Faiths, 
              and of many of its leading members. I doubt, however, whether it 
              can be the position of a faith community, which, insofar as it is 
              organised, seeks to develop its own institutional life. This is 
              why, perhaps, although some great religious leaders recognise this 
              advanced stage, religions as such &#151; and indeed many interfaith 
              organisations &#151; operate at the second stage. That is a great 
              advance on the immaturity that has so often characterised relationships 
              between religions.</p>
            <p>Most of us need a faith community by which we are nourished and 
              to which we contribute. Yet we also need to be disturbed by the 
              advanced devotees who remind us that God is free to enter into loving 
              exchanges with whomsoever He wishes.</p>
