            <p align="left"><b>An orthodox Jewish response</b></p>
            <p align="left">There seem to me to be unresolved ambiguities in the 
              ISKCON document, specifically be-tween the denial of mission in 
              the body of the document and the clearly missionary ethos of ISKCON 
              expressed in the Primary Aim of the movement and in its Seven Purposes.</p>
            <p>On the one hand there are a series of statements indicating a negative 
              attitude to mis-sionary activity. It is said, for example, that 
              no one religion holds a monopoly on the truth  (p. 2); it is not 
              proper to constantly propagate the superiority of one's own teachers 
              over other people's teachers; a devotee, instead of criticising 
              other religious systems, should encourage their followers to stick 
              to their principles; ISKCON does not have a mission to proselytise 
              members of other faiths (p. 3); ISKCON does not advocate any sectarian 
              religion (p. 4); ISKCON members should respect the right of others 
              to disagree and their desire to be left alone, and should not feel 
              the need to convert them (p. 7); and there is no difference between 
              a pure Christian and a sincere devotee of Krsna (note 18).</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there are statements that make mission and conversion 
              a central feature of ISKCON's outlook. Thus it views dialogue with 
              other faiths as an opportunity to share its commitment and faith 
              with others (p. 1); Swami Prabhupada came to New York in September 
              1965 to 'systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society 
              at large and to educate all peoples in the techniques of spiritual 
              life' (the primary aim of ISKCON); he came West to deliver Western 
              countries from godlessness (atheism) (p. 2); ISKCON sees interfaith 
              dialogue as a challenge of faith to devotees of every tradition 
              (p. 4); one cannot live without a loving and serving relationship 
              with Krsna and His devotees (p. 6); it is ISKCON's purpose to propagate 
              a consciousness of Krsna (God), as it is revealed in the great scriptures 
              of India, the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam;</i> 
              to develop the idea within humanity at large that each soul is part 
              and parcel of the quality of the Godhead (Krsna); and to teach and 
              encourage the chanting of the holy name of God as revealed in the 
              teachings of Caitanya (pp. 7-8, Appendix).</p>
            <p>It seems from these latter statements that mission and conversion, 
              in the most obvious meaning of these terms, are indeed at the heart 
              of ISKCON, and are exemplified by the 'mission' of Swami Prabhupada 
              in the West and by the conversion of non-Hindus to a clearly sectarian 
              religious position. I do not understand how one can reconcile this 
              with Swami Prabhupada's explicit statement that 'We do not advocate 
              any sectarian religion.'</p>
            <p>If a primary purpose of ISKCON is to propagate a consciousness 
              of Krsna as found in the <i>Gita </i>and <i>Bhagavata </i>(Purpose 
              number 2, p. 7), then it is clearly a sectarian, missionary religion. 
              It is all very well saying that this propagation does not actually 
              take place among the believers of different religious traditions, 
              but among the unbelievers, the doubters, and those lacking spirituality. 
              This merely indicates that those targeted by missionaries (any missionaries, 
              whether ISKCON or not) are the weak and confused members of a religious 
              tradition. </p>
            <p>Judaism does not see itself as a missionary religion. Although 
              it accepts converts who feel they have been called to serve God 
              from within the Jewish tradition, it only accepts them after a prolonged 
              period of study and contemplation. The reason why Judaism does not 
              actively promulgate its faith is because Jews regard themselves 
              as members of a specific covenantal faith community called by God 
              to exemplify His teachings. They recognise that non-Jews, with their 
              own <i>dharma </i>as it were, may also be called by God to serve 
              Him, and may be devoted to Him from a different religious position. 
              Jews are 'called', whether they believe or not. They are part of 
              the covenantal community, whether they respond or not, that is their 
              particular <i>dharma </i>as it were.</p>
            <p>Orthodox Judaism does not encourage formal interfaith dialogue 
              on matters of spirituality or belief, since those committed to propagating 
              a faith understandably tend to use any opportunity, including the 
              'dialogue' situation, to spread its teachings. This has been the 
              experience of Jews in past contacts with Christians and with Moslems. 
              Thus, though Jews may be willing to share ethical or social concerns 
              with members of other faiths, Orthodox Judaism does not wish to 
              share in 'spiritual' dialogue with other faiths, certainly not with 
              those committed to missionarising. It takes a lot of introspection 
              for someone to be aware of a deeply held desire to convince others 
              of the truth of one's own views. This applies even for those within 
              a committed non-missionary tradition, how much more so from within 
              a faith tradition permeated by mission. </p>
            <p>From a Jewish perspective, the ISKCON document on dialogue may 
              be regarded as expressing a typically sectarian position, albeit 
              in a modified form, and making sectarian assumptions about the nature 
              of God and of the spiritual life. There is, of course, nothing wrong 
              with this as long as it is acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Some of the assumptions made in the Document about the universality 
              of Krsna only tend to reinforce scepticism with regard to it. A 
              number of elements of Vaisnava faith are obviously at odds with 
              Jewish assumptions, and the authors of the Document are speaking 
              not simply about God and spiritual techniques, but about God and 
              spirituality as understood by the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition within 
              Hinduism.</p>
            <p>To take one example mentioned in the Document. Purpose number three 
              (p. 7), of the Seven Purposes formulated by Swami Prabhupada, states 
              that one aim of ISKCON is to develop 'the idea within the members 
              and humanity at large, that each soul is part and parcel of the 
              quality of Godhead (Krsna).' Judaism does not believe that each 
              soul is 'part and parcel of the quality of the Godhead' if this 
              is taken literally, indeed such an idea may be regarded as blasphemous 
              to Judaism. ISKCON, despite its claims to universality, is representing 
              a particular understanding of devotion to God, and particular ways 
              of serving Him, e.g. by encouraging the chanting of the divine names 
              as taught by Caitanya (an act not actually permitted by Judaism, 
              which prohibits taking God's name in vain).</p>
            <p>While the mere appearance of the Document is, I am sure, an important 
              moment in ISKCON self-consciousness, for Orthodox Jews, at least, 
              it will seem to be of limited appeal. Genuine respect for other 
              faith traditions also means listening to, and respecting, the limitations 
              on what can be shared. Whether one can talk meaningfully about God 
              and the spiritual life outside of any sectarian or cultural tradition 
              seems doubtful.</p>
