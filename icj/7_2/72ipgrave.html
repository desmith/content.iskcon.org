            <p>I have to confess that my first reaction on reading this document 
              was a rather unworthy one: a feeling of envy. There is, as far as 
              I am aware, no generally agreed statement in the Christian tradition 
              corresponding to this document, but it would be enormously helpful 
              if there were, for two reasons.</p>
            <p>Firstly, 'ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in God' surely 
              does fulfil the objective, described by Saunaka Rsi Dasa, of 'providing 
              clear principles, guidelines and perspectives for relationships 
              with members of other faiths'. It does so as an authorised text, 
              setting out a practically oriented path for devotees to follow in 
              their interfaith relations. Lying behind the text there is clearly 
              the accumulated wisdom gained through a broad process of consultation, 
              a wisdom that will continue to grow as ISKCON members put into practice 
              the recommendations here, and further reflect on the patterns of 
              insight that emerge from their encounters. In other words, while 
              this is an official statement of the Society, it also seems to me 
              to that it has the potential to function very much as a living text, 
              part of a continuing process in which experience and reflection 
              are intertwined. This suggests to me a concern with <i>orthopraxis</i> 
              &#151; a term much used in modern Christian theology &#151; 'right 
              action' in the way we express our faith.</p>
            <p>A second reason for valuing this document so highly is that it 
              also grounds this orthopraxis in a serious <i>orthodoxy</i>, 'right 
              belief' about the way in which God may be apprehended in the Vaisnava 
              tradition. Over the last few decades, there has been a serious Christian 
              effort to find an adequate theological grounding for our practice 
              of dialogue, yet Christian diversity and the complexities of our 
              history are such that there is no agreed text to which we could 
              point. In fact, it is interesting to observe that the most influential 
              of all Christian documents in this regard is now more than 30 years 
              old: The Second Vatican Council's declaration <i>Nostra Aetate,</i> 
              calling for Christian 'discussion and collaboration with members 
              of other religions' was issued in 1965.</p>
            <p>Given then that this seems a valuable document for ISKCON to have 
              produced from a Vaisnava perspective, how as a Christian do I respond 
              to what I read here? Certainly, there is much in 'ISKCON in Relation 
              to People of Faith in God' that I can recognise as convergent with 
              my own Christian understanding of religious plurality, and with 
              the guidelines to which, as a Christian, I would aspire to in interfaith 
              meeting and dialogue. Of course, there is always a danger here of 
              making an easy but misleading assumption: namely, that words taken 
              from the Vaisnava tradition are being used in the same way that 
              they would be in a Christian discourse. We need to be aware, for 
              example, that all of us fill out the meaning of such expressions 
              as 'mission', 'spirituality', 'worship' with references taken from 
              our own religious paths. Even more centrally important terms like 
              'personal God' or 'religious faith' may be interpreted by Christians 
              and Vaisnavas in subtly different ways. Nevertheless, with these 
              cautions in mind, I am convinced from reading this Vaisnava statement 
              that its theological vocabulary has enough resonance with ours to 
              enable a serious shared conversation. I want to briefly trace, through 
              the document's four parts, some common concerns, as well as some 
              outstanding questions.</p>
            <p><b>Part One</b>, the actual statement on 'Relating with People 
              of Faith in God', underlines the centrality for ISKCON of 'love 
              of a Supreme personal God', and on the basis of this extends a generous 
              recognition and respect for 'other theistic traditions' where that 
              love is to be found. At the same time, there is an acknowledgement 
              of other religious paths and of the contributions of all people 
              of good will. I was interested here to think further about the finely 
              crafted language in which the statement describes three successive 
              levels of response: 'recognising and respecting' (theistic ways), 
              'respecting the spiritual worth' (of non-theistic religious paths) 
              and 'valuing as beneficial to society' (humanitarian initiatives). 
              Christianity is one of the faith traditions where God is recognised 
              and adored as personal, though the precise understanding of personality 
              in relation to a Trinitarian account of God has always been a matter 
              of some debate. Christian spirituality, which emphasises the love 
              of God, therefore, would seem to fall into the 'recognising and 
              respecting' group. In this sense, we could say that Christians are 
              closer to Vaisnavas than to followers of non-theistic paths. At 
              the same time, most Christians would also want to affirm respect 
              for Buddhists, non-theistic Hindus, and other religiously committed 
              people who do not share a theistic perspective.</p>
            <p>What we seem to be facing here is the difficult question of how 
              to emphasise our close-ness to some patterns of spirituality without 
              devaluing others. This challenge also faced the Fathers of the Vatican 
              Council; <i>Nostra Aetate</i> addressed this through implying a 
              series of concentric circles &#151; from the outside in: (1) the 
              community of all humanity, with a certain religious sense; (2) 'the 
              religions which are found in more advanced civilisations' (Hinduism 
              and Buddhism are singled out by name); (3) Islam; (4) Judaism. Something 
              like this concentric schema is quite common among Christians today; 
              yet I have doubts about its applicability. I think more in terms 
              of a Venn diagram, where a series of circles have different areas 
              of overlap. Christianity and Buddhism, for example, seem doctrinally 
              to be as far apart as is imaginable; yet the inter-monastic encounter 
              of Christian and Buddhist religions is one of the liveliest areas 
              of interfaith dialogue today.</p>
            <p>Whatever approach we adopt, it is surely significant that the underlying 
              issues for Christians and Vaisnavas are so similar. Equally, the 
              attitudes of respect, understanding, humility and co-operation, 
              which the statement commends, are those that Christians today would 
              want to endorse. It has been no easy position for the churches to 
              reach this position. In the past, the zeal of many for the truth 
              of the Christian message easily slid, by means of the dangerous 
              doctrine that 'error has no rights', into a rigorous intolerance 
              of religious difference. We have had to learn, with difficulty, 
              to respect the integrity of other faith traditions and to safeguard 
              the principle of religious freedom for all. Still today, Vaisnava 
              and Christian believers, in different ways and in different countries, 
              have stories to tell of freedoms denied. From those experiences, 
              perhaps we can together affirm wholeheartedly the value of that 
              freedom which is implicitly commended in this statement.</p>
            <p>But our relating with faithful people of other ways also needs 
              to join up in some way with the core affirmations and activities 
              of our own faith. In this connection I was very inter-ested to read 
              the next two parts of the text, dealing with dialogue in the contexts 
              of mission and of theology.</p>
            <p><b>Part Two</b>, 'ISKCON in Dialogue and Mission', will certainly 
              resonate for any Christian who has been involved in the many discussions 
              around the same subject within the churches. Vaisnavas and Christians 
              share a deep-seated instinct for mission, which is both spiritually 
              required by the very core visions of our respective faiths and also 
              historically written into the development of our respective communities. 
              The contents of those visions are quite distinct, and so are the 
              patterns of our missionary development, yet both traditions face 
              the same challenge of relating a missionary imperative with a commitment 
              to dialogue. The churches have not come to any kind of consensus 
              on how to meet this challenge. This situation is not helped by the 
              characteristic Christian habit of different people using the same 
              words to mean different things, and different words to mean the 
              same thing.  'Evangelism', 'evangelisation, 'mission', 'witness', 
              'conversion, 'proselytisation', and so on, are all important terms 
              in the debate, but Christians find it extraordinarily difficult 
              to agree even on their respective meanings, let alone on how they 
              should be correlated.</p>
            <p>I personally do not think that this is entirely a matter of regret; 
              confusion and fluidity are often signs of life, and certainly the 
              mission-dialogue debate is very lively within the Christian community 
              at present. It has been suggested that one sharp way of posing the 
              underlying theological issue for Christians is to ask us the question: 
              'Do you think that the existence of a continuing diversity of religions 
              is according to the will of God?' As I read this second part of 
              ISKCON's text, it implies to me that Vaisnavas would probably want 
              to answer that question in the affirmative. I notice, for example, 
              the quotation from Srila Prabhupada's 1969 lecture:</p>
            <p>Everyone should follow the particular traditions or <i>sampradaya</i>, 
              the regulative principles of your own religion. This is required 
              as much as many political parties.</p>
            <p>This is certainly a position that would closely describe the attitude 
              that many Christians would take in an ecumenical context with respect 
              to the existence of different Christian denominations. The number 
              prepared to adopt a similarly pluralist approach in a multi-faith 
              context is smaller.</p>
            <p>However, even those in the churches who do not share this statement's 
              attitude to other faiths will have to take seriously another dimension 
              which is present here: the sense of a shared mission to be jointly 
              owned by the faith communities in addressing society. In the ISKCON 
              tradition, as represented in this text by references to Srila Prabhupada 
              and to Bhaktivinoda Thakura, this mission is seen in quite confrontational 
              terms as facing the 'ene-my' of atheism, of growing influence in 
              a 'Godless civilisation'. In relating specifically to western culture, 
              the churches of Europe and North America have generally taken a 
              more nuanced approach, recognising not only the increasingly secularised 
              character of the official structures of society, but also the persistence 
              of attitudes and aspirations which owe much of their inspiration 
              to Christian values in the broad sense of that term. Yet the fundamental 
              religious motivation of 'establishing a God-conscious ethos in our 
              modern world' seems to me close to the Christian project of working 
              towards the realisation of the 'Kingdom of God'. Insofar as other 
              traditions share similar motivations, the idea of a 'shared mission' 
              among our faiths is surely one that deserves further exploration, 
              in dialogue with wider society.</p>
            <p><b>Part Three</b> provides a theological basis for dialogue in 
              two related ways: through pointing to the fundamental categories 
              by which Vaisnava theology interprets the reality of religion (or, 
              more properly, of <i>sanatana-dharma</i>, which is explicitly distinguished 
              from 'any sectarian process of religion'); and through outlining 
              the progressive stages in the development of Vaisnava spirituality 
              which enable dialogical participation on the part of the devotee. 
              It is more difficult to draw obvious parallels with Christian thought 
              here, precisely be-cause the ISKCON text so successfully provides 
              this double anchorage of interfaith involvement within the distinctive 
              grounding of the Vaisnava vision of ultimate reality. This reality 
              is expressed in terms rather different from those of Christian theology 
              and spirituality. Even so, as I read these words quoted from Srila 
              Prabhupada's commentary on Rupa Goswami's <i>Upadesamrta</i>:</p>
            <p>In all parts of the world, however downtrodden human society may 
              be, there is some system of religion ... . When a religious system 
              develops and turns into love of God, it is successful ...</p>
            <p>I found myself calling to mind the words ascribed to St Paul when 
              he addressed the Athenians on the hill of Areopagus:</p>
            <p>God allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of 
              the places where they would live to all the nations, so that they 
              would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him &#151; 
              though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For in him we live 
              and move and have our being. (Acts 17.26-27)</p>
            <p>More than tracing parallels in thought between our two faiths, 
              though, the challenge which this part of the ISKCON text presents 
              to us as Christians is to formulate a way of grounding our interfaith 
              involvement firmly in the central affirmations which our Christian 
              faith wants to make about God. If we do not achieve that, there 
              is the real, ever-present danger of a dis-sociation between, on 
              one hand, the language we use in our confessional gathering, sacramental 
              worship and intimate prayer, and, on the other, the language we 
              use in our encounter, dialogue and co-operation with people from 
              other faith traditions. So I read <i>ISKCON in Rela-tion to People 
              of Faith in God</i> as an exemplar of the integration of interfaith 
              involvement with a committed exploration of the central affirmations 
              of one's own faith.</p>
            <p>What might be the starting-point for Christians seeking to find, 
              in their own core-faith resources, the grounds for a generous and 
              confident engagement with religious plurality? It is interesting 
              to observe that much of the energy in Christian theology today springs 
              from a rediscovery of the centrality in doctrine and spirituality 
              of the idea of God as a Trinity &#151; Father, Son and Spirit, three 
              personal realities eternally distinguished but also united in a 
              web of mutual love and service. Like Vaisnava accounts of <i>sanatana-dharma</i> 
              as 'Krsna con-sciousness or pure love of God', a Trinitarian approach 
              involves an essentially relational understanding of ultimate reality; 
              as such, it could be well suited to making sense both of multi-faith 
              plurality and of interfaith encounter. The recent report of the 
              Church of England's Doctrine Commission, <i>The Mystery of Salvation</i> 
              (1995), certainly thought so. In words that map out a major programme 
              for Christian theologians, it affirmed that:</p>
            <p>The distinctive understanding of God as Trinity should be at the 
              centre of any interfaith reflection.</p>
            <p><b>Part Four</b> of the ISKCON document offers its readers practical 
              'Principles and Guidelines for Approaching People with Faith in 
              God'. Although these are drawn up specifically with Vaisnava devotees 
              in mind, there is much in both 'principles' and 'guidelines' which 
              would be equally useful for Christians or people of any other faith 
              &#151; this section constitutes in effect a code of etiquette for 
              personal behaviour in interfaith relations. Particularly important 
              is the emphasis that 'approaching people with faith in God' is first 
              and foremost a venture in interpersonal relationships, and therefore 
              basic attitudes of honesty, understanding, trust, humility and common 
              sense are indispensable. </p>
            <p>The penultimate guideline advises devotees as follows:</p>
            <p>You will meet fundamentalist religionists and atheistic scholars. 
              Offer them due respect and move on. Sincere dialogue on spiritual 
              matters will not be possible with them.</p>
            <p>The situation envisaged here is of course that of interfaith encounter. 
              However, the reality, in the Christian case at least, is that 'fundamentalist 
              religionists' are to be met within our own communities also. I cannot 
              say whether this is a pattern of behaviour to be encountered within 
              ISKCON also, but I suspect that most religious groups number among 
              their ad-herents those who are suspicious, hesitant or downright 
              hostile towards any idea of sharing openly with people from another 
              tradition.</p>
            <p>It may not in fact be very helpful to bracket such people under 
              the general category of 'fundamentalists'. That term originated 
              in a Christian movement reaffirming what were seen to be 'fundamentals' 
              of the faith, felt to be threatened by a sceptical attitude; but 
              people in any faith tradition will rightly object to any suggestion 
              that they should take lightly matters that they regard as being 
              of fundamental importance to their beliefs. The significant problem, 
              in any case, is not how liberal or how conservative people are in 
              their theology, but how open or how closed they are in their attitudes 
              to others.</p>
            <p>To encourage openness in interfaith relations, our communities 
              must themselves be models of dialogue in their intra-faith structuring. 
              That is to say, we need to be engaged as Christians, not only with 
              Vaisnavas, but also with our fellow Christians, especially those 
              who find the idea of another faith threatening or offensive. In 
              fact, having in mind the possibilities of a 'shared mission' outlined 
              in Part Two, it is possible to say that Christians (or Vaisnavas, 
              or people of any faith) are involved in three simultaneous dialogical 
              processes, each of which can be identified by a preposition: We 
              are in primary dialogue <i>with</i> people of other faith traditions; 
              supporting that dialogue within our own faith community is a dialogue 
              <i>about </i>other faiths; growing from the primary dialogue is 
              a dialogue <i>alongside</i> other faith communities addressed to 
              wider society. </p>
            <p>'ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in God' is undoubtedly a 
              very useful resource for the primary dialogue of Vaisnavas <i>with</i> 
              Christians (and people of other faiths). It would be interesting 
              to know to what extent its reception within ISKCON generates an 
              intra-Vaisnava dialogue<i> about</i> approaches to other faith communities. 
              The document encourages us to take more seriously the possibilities 
              of a shared approach to wider society as Vaisnavas and Christians 
              <i>alongside</i> people of other faith traditions. </p>
