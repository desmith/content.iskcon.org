            from a panel discussion held at the 1999 Annual Conference of the 
            American Family Foundation (AFF), 15 May 1999, in St. Paul, Minnesota, 
            USA </i> 
            <p><b>Introduction by Anuttama Dasa</b></p>
            <p><b>Setting the stage</b></p>
            <p>Beginning in the mid-1970s in the United States, members of the 
              so-called 'anti-cult' movement and organisations such as the Cult 
              Awareness Network (CAN) and the American Family Foundation (AFF) 
              raised questions about the authenticity and activities of the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and accused ISKCON of 
              being 'a dangerous cult'.</p>
            <p>Some anti-cultists lumped ISKCON in with other groups or religions 
              new to the American scene, finding ISKCON guilty by association 
              of a myriad of evils, and simultaneously feeding a media frenzy 
              about the 'cult scare'. On the extreme, Ted Patrick and other 'deprogrammers', 
              kidnapped Hare Krishna members and utilised various abrasive means 
              to try to force devotees to abandon their Vaisnava beliefs and practices.</p>
            <p>At the same time there were legitimate concerns about ISKCON, not 
              only from the anti-cultists but also among parents, the media and 
              scholars. Questions arose about the status of women, young people 
              abandoning their secular education to join ISKCON, families feeling 
              cut off from their children who had joined ISKCON, the long-term 
              care of individual members within the society and the concentrated 
              power placed in the hands of ISKCON's new generation of leaders.</p>
            <p>These concerns, coupled with a series of revelations of serious 
              legal and moral improprieties by some ISKCON leaders and communities, 
              set the stage for twenty years of mutual distrust, shared accusations, 
              jousting in the press, legal manoeuvring and lawsuits between ISKCON 
              and the 'anti-cultists'.</p>
            <p><b>ISKCON at thirty</b></p>
            <p>In May 1996, Gustav Niebuhr wrote a column for the New York Times 
              entitled 'Hare Krishnas at Thirty: Real Changes or PR?' Niebuhr 
              reported on the celebration of the Hare Krishna movement's first 
              30 years in the West, and on the continuing questions surrounding 
              ISKCON.</p>
            <p>Niebuhr interviewed me in my role as communications director for 
              ISKCON in North America. Niebuhr also interviewed Marcia Rudin, 
              director of International Cult Education Program, an affiliate of 
              the American Family Foundation. While stating that she fielded fewer 
              inquiries about ISKCON in recent years, Rudin was quoted as questioning 
              whether ISKCON was really maturing or was just a slick operator. 
              'All cults are very PR-minded', Rudin said. 'They want to appear 
              very mainstream.'</p>
            <p>I was not happy that Niebuhr had felt obliged to talk to Rudin, 
              nor that her quote more or less rained on our Thirtieth Anniversary 
              article.</p>
            <p>Niebuhr's response to my follow-up phone call was direct, and hard 
              to ignore. 'It is out there, Anuttama, you need to deal with it 
              [the lingering perspective that ISKCON is a cult].' </p>
            <p>So, I wrote a letter to Marcia Rudin. Rudin referred me to Dr. 
              Michael Langone, Executive Director for AFF. After an exchange of 
              several letters and extended phone calls, Langone invited me to 
              attend an AFF-sponsored Cult Education programme at the National 
              Institute of Health in Washington, DC.</p>
            <p>Harvey Stemple, or Hari Dasa, at that time a Masters student in 
              pastoral counselling, attended the conference with me. We found 
              the programme interesting, and surprisingly full of very diverse 
              views. Afterwards, Langone and some friends joined Hari Dasa, my 
              wife Rukmini Dasi and myself for dinner at a nearby vegetarian restaurant.</p>
            <p>David King, an AFF member, broke the ice with an innocent question: 
              'What is Bhaktipada doing these days?' This was 1996, New Vrindaban 
              was completing its tenth year of expulsion from ISKCON, Kirtanananda 
              Swami Bhaktipada was facing a lengthy jail term, and I was extremely 
              uncomfortable with this first topic of discussion. </p>
            <p>I explained that Kirtanananda was expelled from ISKCON, that ISKCON 
              officials had co-operated with the government proceedings against 
              him and that he did not at all represent the values or behaviour 
              that ISKCON advocates. King was genuinely pleased to hear of ISKCON's 
              housecleaning.</p>
            <p>Reciprocating, I also asked an innocent question: 'What is Ted 
              Patrick doing these days?' King and his colleagues were as discomfited 
              by my question as I had been by theirs. Patrick, they explained, 
              was not representative of AFF views or policies, nor did his earlier 
              criminal conviction and jail term exemplify the principles and behaviour 
              that AFF members adhere to.</p>
            <p>It was an interesting exchange. From that point on, I was convinced 
              there was room for genuine dialogue.</p>
            <p>In 1997, following that landmark meeting, Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, 
              Rukmini Dasi and myself attended the annual AFF national convention. 
              In 1998, we again attended the convention and this time met privately 
              with leaders of AFF to address some of their questions and concerns 
              about ISKCON. The meetings were frank and informative.</p>
            <p><b>May 1999</b></p>
            <p>In 1999, Radha-devi Dasi, an attorney and consultant to the ISKCON 
              North American Temple Support Office, and I were asked to appear 
              on a panel at the AFF Convention. The panel's title was: 'Can Cultic 
              Groups Change: The Case of ISKCON.' Despite our discomfort with 
              the underlying assumptions of the title of the panel, we welcomed 
              the opportunity to speak with approximately 100 leaders from anti-cult 
              organisations from around the world. </p>
            <p>What follows are excerpts from the panel discussion 'Can Cultic 
              Groups Change: The Case of ISKCON.'</p>

            <p><b><br>
              Dubrow-Eichel:</b> This panel was several years in the making. What 
              impressed a number of people in AFF was the way that the individuals 
              representing ISKCON, especially Anuttama, were not only acknowledging 
              past abuses and problems within ISKCON, but current problems as 
              well. So we decided to go ahead and continue this discussion. This 
              dialogue can potentially lead to continuing reform in ISKCON and 
              an expanded mission and, possibly, enhanced vitality for AFF. These 
              dialogues ultimately lead to a maturation process, a growing sense 
              of trust and a clear exposition of what each group wants from the 
              other.</p>
            <p>I am impressed in my discussions with people in AFF as well as 
              the people in ISKCON. It does not feel to me like anyone is pulling 
              any punches or not stating their true feelings about what has happened 
              in the past as well as what might happen now and in the future. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> This is the third AFF Convention I have attended. 
              I have been very intrigued to see the amount of discussion and differences 
              of opinion that exist among members of this group, some of whom 
              are scholars, over the topics of 'brain-washing', 'mind control', 
              'undue influence', 'sects', 'cults', etc. There is a lot of room 
              for further studies. I have seen that theories about these topics 
              are still being developed, refined and adjusted as new information 
              about their accuracy and applicability surfaces. </p>
            <p>Within my organisation there is also a lot ongoing discussion and 
              tensions in acknowledging the problems and shortcomings of the past 
              and the challenges of the present. But we are trying to develop 
              systems for addressing those, and I feel part of the benefit of 
              my attending this conference and panel is to gather information 
              to take back to enhance those discussions.</p>
            <p>Sociologically, I think there is still the conception that Hare 
              Krsna is a very communal organisation, but it is not. It is a congregational 
              organisation with a few members living in <i>asrama </i>or temple 
              communities, and the vast majority of members living independently 
              and maintaining different degrees of affiliation and commitment 
              with their local temples. In the United States approximately 50% 
              of our congregation are Asian Indians. </p>
            <p>A critical point is that, while the ISKCON organisation itself 
              is only 30 years old, Hare Krsna is very deeply rooted within the 
              broader Hindu tradition. Specifically it is part of the Caitanya 
              Vaisnava lineage.</p>
            <p> ISKCON was established in New York in 1966 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Prabhupada, a teacher, author, and spiritual leader who brought 
              Krsna consciousness, or the Vaisnava tradition, to the West.</p>
            <p>Theologically speaking, I would argue very strongly, and scholars 
              support this, that Krsna consciousness is definitely not new. Organisationally, 
              ISKCON is new. Many of our organisational problems came from the 
              fact that in the early years especially, most ISKCON members were 
              young Western converts. Due to a lack of maturity and organisational 
              structure, there was a vulnerability to excess and abuse of power.</p>
            <p>Another issue, or tension, for us is the question of authority 
              and leadership. The traditional model in most Indian religious traditions 
              is a hierarchical organisation, with the con-centration of power 
              in the hands of one individual, the guru, or <i>acarya</i>. Shortly 
              before his passing away, my teacher, Prabhupada, established a Governing 
              Body Commission, a group of people to oversee the ISKCON organisation. 
              After his death in 1977, there was a series of crises with some 
              of the topmost, hand-selected leaders, who had been appointed as 
              gurus. There was quite a struggle between the organisation and some 
              of those individuals who argued that as gurus their position was 
              above the authority of the GBC.</p>
            <p>This struggle lasted for years. Many people argued that the tradition 
              supports the guru as the absolute principal of authority, divine 
              authority. This can be strongly documented in much of Hindu religious 
              thought. Our organisation has struggled to solidly establish that, 
              in our movement, no one is above our managing body and that there 
              must be checks and bal-ances for all. In 1986, there was a series 
              of reforms limiting what is known in ISKCON jargon as the 'zonal 
              <i>acarya </i>system'. This year, 1999, there was another series 
              of resolutions passed at the international meetings giving more 
              specific interpretation of appropriate powers and privileges for 
              those in leadership positions.</p>
            <p>The last area I want to touch on is training and education. Frankly, 
              in our organisation there was very little, if any, training and 
              education for the first 30 years. This has caused us a lot of problems. 
              Those of you who travel on a regular basis will be happy to know 
              that we now have a 'Book Distribution Training Course' for those 
              individuals who distribute our religious literature in public. It 
              is a four-day course. It is not a lot but it is a good start. It 
              is principle-based and emphases things like honesty &#151; which 
              had been a problem for us with our book distribution &#151; and 
              long-term customer care.</p>
            <p>I recently attended the first North American leadership-training 
              course, a four-day course in Northern Florida. The principles taught 
              there focus on accountability and human relation issues. There was 
              a section on the abuse of power, what is legitimate power, how to 
              respect individual effort, teamwork, etc. It was interesting because 
              half of the first day was a discussion about what we can borrow 
              from modern management techniques without compromising our religious 
              tradition.</p>
            <p><b>Radha-devi Dasi:</b> There are gender issues in any organisation 
              and, one of the things that struck me when we were talking about 
              this panel was that I am the only woman panellist. That is my first 
              point: there are gender issues everywhere. It is not something that 
              happens only in 'cultic groups'.</p>
            <p>I would like to talk about experience, personal experience. I feel 
              very strongly about the power of narrative; that is where I come 
              from as a woman. </p>
            <p>For me, one of the attractions of Krsna consciousness was its reasoned 
              and well thought-out philosophy on how to protect women from sexual 
              exploitation. That was a big issue for me because I have been in 
              universities, I have been in law firms, I have been in so many environments 
              where I saw men misusing their power to exploit young women. This 
              issue of exploitation of women is not something that is unique to 
              any one culture or any one group. I was attracted to Krsna consciousness 
              because there was a philosophy that said we are not our bodies, 
              we are souls, and no one has the right to exploit another soul because 
              all souls are servants of Krsna, God. At the same time, as a university 
              graduate and as a lawyer, I had been trained to question. So, while 
              I was attracted by this philosophy, I was troubled by some of the 
              things I saw. </p>
            <p>One thing you need to understand is that the practice of Krsna 
              consciousness is variegated. Depending on which temple or which 
              region of which country you visit, you are going to have a different 
              experience. When I joined in San Diego, the women stood at the back 
              of the temple during ceremonies. They were not allowed to lead the 
              congregational chanting, they were not allowed to give the scriptural 
              classes, they were not allowed to rise above certain levels of management. 
              My first question was: 'Why not?' </p>
            <p>I was told that it was in order to protect women, otherwise they 
              will be sexually exploited. I was also told that if you want to 
              make spiritual advancement you have to be-come humble; this is a 
              way of making you humble. I decided that I would give this concept 
              a period of observation. I was worried about other practices, too. 
              I thought, 'I am not so sure that makes sense to me, but I&nbsp;am 
              willing to give it a try.'</p>
            <p>With this particular practice I never came to a realisation that 
              putting women in the back and restricting their activities really 
              makes a difference in 'protecting' us. What crystallised this for 
              me was when I had a daughter of my own. I started thinking about 
              how she was going to be shaped by this experience. I started talking 
              to some of the younger women who had grown up in our movement and 
              hearing about how being in the back and being limited in their service 
              had caused them to feel bad about being women. </p>
            <p>I have to tell this story: When my daughter was three she wanted 
              to stand at the front of the temple room. I told her she was not 
              allowed. I could not explain it very well to her because she was 
              only three. What she understood was that the men will get mad at 
              you if you do. So the next time we went to the temple, she walked 
              up to the first man she saw and punched him as hard as she could. 
              I said to myself, 'Okay, it is not just about me anymore.'</p>
            <p>Institutionally, at about the same time, the International Women's 
              Ministry was formed. There were a number of women who had concerns 
              about the treatment of women in ISKCON. I became part of that organisation, 
              and one of our first efforts was a national congress in Los Angeles. 
              We expected about 50-100 participants, but 300 came. We heard a 
              powerful, overwhelming swell of women's voices saying, 'We are not 
              happy with the way things are, and we are not going to continue 
              to allow things to be the way they are.'</p>
            <p>I&nbsp;have written two papers on these topics. One is about women's 
              rights in ISKCON.<a name="101"></a><a href="#01">[1]</a> I looked 
              at the subject from the perspectives of international law and international 
              human rights. This paper challenges the leadership of ISKCON to 
              justify their treatment of women, and pointed out to them, using 
              principles of international law, why the treatment of women does 
              not measure up to the rhetoric of protection that was offered. That 
              paper has been very well received and has resulted in some changes 
              in the way women are treated. The second paper has to do with human 
              rights in ISKCON.<a name="102"></a><a href="#02">[2]</a> Once I 
              started thinking about women's rights, I realised men are here too, 
              and they ought to have some rights also!</p>
            <p>We do now have women on our Governing Body Commission, which is 
              the highest level of administrative organisation in ISKCON. Internationally, 
              we have a number of women who are Temple Presidents or project leaders. 
              In North America, the GBC Executive Committee has four members; 
              two of them are women. More and more temples have policies providing 
              for women to give scripture class and to stand side-by-side with 
              the men. So, now my daughter does&nbsp;not have to punch anyone 
              if she wants to go up to the altar.</p>
            <p>My understanding is that philosophically and historically, ISKCON 
              was a very egalitarian movement at the beginning, but somehow in 
              the 1970s we got side-tracked. In terms of the larger issue of solving 
              institutional abuses and dealing with human rights in general, we 
              are beginning to realise that we were naive. We believed that because 
              we were spiritual people, seeking a spiritual path, that naturally 
              nobody would abuse anybody else. Now we have much evidence to the 
              contrary. We realise that we need institutional safeguards. So there 
              is a movement, within our movement, pushing for ethical standards, 
              pushing for a Constitution, and pushing for a member's Bill of Rights. 
              The papers that I have published include a draft of the Declaration 
              of Rights for ISKCON members.<a name="103"></a><a href="#03">[3]</a></p>
            <p><b>Kelly:</b> For those who do not know me, I was in two different 
              Eastern groups over the course of fourteen years. In leaving those 
              groups, I began to work with families that were concerned about 
              their loved ones in such groups. Over a period of ten years, I became 
              involved on the frontlines of a more critical exploration of the 
              families' concerns about their loved ones' involvement in various 
              groups, including ISKCON. I can say from my own experience that 
              the [ISKCON] people here are to be congratulated for their willingness 
              to come forward amongst this very discriminating crowd. I think 
              that there are changes [within ISKCON]. I&nbsp;have heard this from 
              different families. Things have improved in the ten years since 
              I got involved in this field. </p>
            <p>There still remains a problem though. I hear from a sampling of 
              families who are unable to communicate with their loved ones. There 
              are instances of people involved in ISKCON who are still of high 
              school age, where the family's loved one, their son or daughter, 
              shuts down communication and is being discouraged from opening up 
              to any kind of real dialogue with their parents. Of course, not 
              only is the family dealing with the foreignness of ISKCON culture, 
              but also with a very different belief system. Yet, they are trying 
              as best they can to understand what exactly is going on with their 
              child.</p>
            <p>What I have come to understand, and Radha and Anuttama can correct 
              me if I am wrong, is that in ISKCON today we are not dealing with 
              a monolithic authoritarian structure, but independent churches with 
              leadership that is not entirely under one umbrella. This results 
              in a continuing problem with some maybe renegade individuals who 
              are running things their way &#151; maybe it is the old style. So 
              a mark, almost a scarlet letter, gets placed on the organisation 
              as a whole. I think it would be valuable if you provided some insight 
              in helping us understand what are the differences in various temples, 
              and how do people relate differently among them, for example, how 
              they structure the education of a young person coming into the society.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of some of the old behaviours that we encountered: 
              A young person became involved with a temple. The parents wanted 
              some time to talk and maybe have another person meet with them, 
              just to meet and speak in an open way. The son or daughter was free 
              to come and go, of course. The family was just requesting that they 
              wanted their child to give a weekend before committing his or her 
              life to the organisation; to have some time together with people 
              who put things out on the table. 'We think these people can help 
              us raise our concerns, and you can explain to us where you stand 
              on the issues.'</p>
            <p>What happened next was that such young people were encouraged to 
              leave the setting, go to the police, and tell the police, untruthfully, 
              that they were held against their will. According to a young person 
              in the group, this was done on the advice of people from the temple. 
              These kinds of behaviours were going on. </p>
            <p>So, if parents have legitimate concerns, if they are seeing behaviours 
              that they cannot account for &#151; not just the belief system, 
              but problems with their children &#151; especially in the younger 
              people, how do we deal with that? Again, I have to say that in the 
              last few years these concerns are not coming forward as much as 
              they had in the five years previous, but they remain. So, how to 
              deal with that? How can a family get that communication? Is there 
              a facility or a system being set up for people to be able to deal 
              with those concerns?</p>
            <p>Other issues: From the top-down, how is the authority being policed? 
              Is there a group of peers who can in any way control those 'renegade 
              gurus' within that setting? Or, if someone proclaims himself to 
              be a guru, or has been given a position of guru, is there a peer 
              who could say to him, 'Look, you are getting out-of-hand'? Is there 
              a system of checks that can be enforced within the temple system 
              as it stands today? I think those are some of the remaining concerns, 
              and I am sure that there are many more, but those are the ones that 
              I have had to contend with in my work as an exit counsellor.</p>
            <p><b>Langone:</b> One question that I have is: What do Radha and 
              Anuttama think people in organisations like ours can do that would 
              be more constructive from your viewpoint? I want to make a comment 
              also, related to my talk yesterday morning. We were discussing four 
              areas of concern that arise in regard to controversial groups: the 
              psychological-harm issue, the ethics-of-influence issue, the social-harm 
              issue and the theological issue. I want to reiterate to people here 
              the importance of not mixing up those four elements. Do not, for 
              example, accuse a group of unethical behaviour or thought reform 
              because you disapprove of it theologically or because you do not 
              like its social customs. Disagree with it theologically, if you 
              want, but do not unthinkingly slide into a negative mindset that 
              tags all 'bad' things on the group. Make your criticisms specific 
              and base them on evidence.</p>
            <p>I hope and I wish that the reform within ISKCON goes well, and 
              that you succeed in bringing about the kinds of changes that have 
              started. If ISKCON succeeds in changing, adapting and establishing 
              accountability mechanisms, it will become more or less mainstreamed, 
              at least ethically, into US society.</p>
            <p>ISKCON will always be somewhat deviant and alien because of the 
              nature of the dress and so on. That is something that you will always 
              carry with you, at least for the foreseeable future. Your theology 
              is different too. Many parents, even if you change, might be upset 
              just because of the theological differences. For example, if my 
              son and daughter &#151; in some future day when ISKCON has managed 
              all these problems &#151; shows an interest in ISKCON, I would be 
              concerned. Not necessarily because they are bad people, or it is 
              unethical or anything, but because I am not a Hindu. I would want 
              my son or my daughter to get the best that I can offer, with what 
              I know. And I would quite frankly seek some help. In that situation 
              I would not go to a thought reform counsellor, I would try to talk 
              to someone who could represent Christian theology and who also knew 
              the Hindu theology. </p>
            <p>I say this to emphasise that there can be a theological disagreement 
              and a theological concern without necessarily having concerns about 
              thought reform, unethical behaviours and psychological harm. One 
              question then is: What would be your feeling towards a parent who 
              is concerned about the theological aspect? How would you deal with 
              the problem of having a prospective member, interested in ISKCON, 
              who has a concerned family that wants to make sure their relative 
              really makes an informed theological decision? </p>
            <p><b>Radha Dasi:</b> I think everyone should make an informed theological 
              choice about anything they get involved with. Quite frankly, I think 
              that ISKCON has suffered from the effects of people joining with 
              misconceptions and misunderstandings, or joining for the wrong reasons 
              &#151; as much as the individuals themselves suffered. </p>
            <p>I think there is a reason that there are different paths to the 
              higher power. People have to find the path that works for them. 
              If my son wanted to become a Presbyterian, I would be very much 
              hurt and I would feel very much rejected. I would worry about his 
              missing the wonderful family traditions that we have. I can see 
              myself asking, 'Are you not going to be there for our Janmastami 
              celebration?'</p>
            <p>At the same time, I go home to my mother's as often as I can, and 
              we celebrate Thanksgiving together. I think that is just part of 
              the family dynamic. There is always some give and take. Part of 
              growing up is becoming an individual, separating from our parents, 
              and making our own choices. Those should be informed choices, and 
              as parents we have to learn to let go.</p>
            <p>I am very intrigued by the question of what AFF has to offer ISKCON. 
              I would be fascinated to have a model that I could take back to 
              ISKCON, where we could test our members, and we could test our leaders, 
              and we could identify what is a potentially abusive practice. </p>
            <p>Margaret Singer talked about how women and the elderly are particularly 
              vulnerable groups in society in general. This is also true in ISKCON. 
              Being in a vulnerable group &#151; as a woman of colour, growing 
              up in America &#151; that issue resonates with me. One of the things 
              that I have been doing is to try and encourage women in our movement 
              who have suffered to go outside ISKCON for help, to go to a battered-women's 
              shelter, or to go to a counsellor for help. One of the fears they 
              have is: 'If I go there and they find out that I am a Hare Krsna 
              devotee, they are going to reject me.' There is a lot of fear behind 
              that. I think you can help us to educate the public about who we 
              really are. If you can help to educate the public and the therapeutic 
              community about how to deal with Hare Krsna devotees, this will 
              be of immense value to us. One of the biggest mistakes we could 
              make would be to continue to be insular. I hope that this is the 
              beginning of a process of us opening up.</p>
            <p><b>Langone:</b> If I could just comment briefly on your first question 
              about how we evaluate abusive practices and enhance accountability 
              &#151; there is no simple answer to this question, and a lot more 
              research is needed.</p>
            <p>Abuse has two aspects: first, the ethical aspect &#151; something 
              unethical is done to a person; second, the psychological effect 
              &#151; how the person reacts to what is done (for example, depression, 
              anxiety, anger, withdrawal). Moreover, personality differences can 
              cause different people to react differently to the same unethical 
              behaviour. For example, negative psychological effects can result 
              when unassertiveness prevents a person from exhibiting normal kinds 
              of resistance to what most might see as mildly inappropriate or 
              unethical pushing; that person may perceive it as extreme pushing. 
              To try to give a short answer to the question, let me say simply 
              that you need to evaluate common kinds of interpersonal behaviours, 
              especially leader-subordinate behaviours, according to ethical standards 
              and you need to be alert to the presence of emotional reactions 
              that may result from unethical, abusive behaviours.</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> One of the things ISKCON has suffered from 
              is that we expanded too fast. We are very proud that we expanded 
              very fast, and there was a tremendous emphasis on quantitative growth. 
              We measured our successes by how many books were distributed and 
              so on, that is part of our mission. We are a missionary movement 
              and we cannot deny it. But there was very little screening of new 
              members, especially in the early days, and very little training. 
              Now we are seeing the need to go back and make sure there is proper 
              training. This is part of the answer to Joe's question about accountability. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Kelly:</b> There is a history within your group &#151; and I 
              do not know if this is still continuing &#151; of people dropping 
              out of school. These might be quite talented individuals who could 
              benefit the organisation [if they completed their education], who 
              end up locked into the system of a celibate monastic community. 
              I am not saying that there is anything necessarily wrong with monastic 
              life, but when people within your organisation have some talent 
              and they are not politically astute, do they have an opportunity 
              to rise up and get the education or support they need from the community?</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> I think part of what shows up in the equation 
              is a serious generational problem. Some of our young people who 
              had attended our parochial schools and are now in their late twenties 
              spoke to the leadership at an international meeting earlier this 
              year. These were young men and women who unfortunately had suffered 
              abuse as children. One young man said that for the older generation, 
              their parents, ISKCON was the organisation or philosophy that gave 
              meaning, focus and purpose &#151; it helped us deal with the excessive 
              materialism all around us &#151; whereas for many in his generation, 
              ISKCON was seen as a source of pain, anxiety and social pressure. 
              It was very painful to hear these young people speak.</p>
            <p><b>Langone:</b> Some Catholic monastic orders will encourage people 
              to go back, to go out into the world for a year to make sure they 
              want the monastic life. Is there any consideration or action to 
              develop that type of safeguard within ISKCON?</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> There is no structure like that yet.</p>
            <p><b>Dubrow-Eichel:</b> I am going to ask our panel a couple of questions 
              here. What other provisions are being made now for those individuals 
              who are full-time members of the temple? What provisions are there 
              for medical insurance, medical care and things like that?</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> Not as much as there should be. It varies 
              from location to location. But it is becoming a bigger issue now 
              that retirement is looming on the horizon for many. These are the 
              kind of practical issues that now need to be addressed. It is definitely 
              on the table, but there is nothing really systematically in place. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dubrow-Eichel:</b> Another series of questions involve your 
              relationship with the leadership of ISKCON. How are you seen by 
              other people, by other members of the GBC, for example?</p>
            <p><b>Radha Dasi:</b> I have always maintained somewhat more independence 
              than many devotees. I have never lived in a communal setting. Even 
              this year, when I was asked to become more involved in working with 
              the temples on a legal basis, I came as an independent consultant. 
              I do feel the need to maintain some distance. Part of my role is 
              as an observer, as a mirror, and I think that the more I am dependent 
              on a pay-cheque or whatever, the less objective I can be. The North 
              American Women's Ministry made the decision to separately incorporate 
              as an independent non-profit corporation. We decided that we would 
              maintain some autonomy, even though it meant we had to raise our 
              own funds.</p>
            <p><b>Dubrow-Eichel:</b> Michael mentioned to me a year or so ago 
              that what impressed him was that the initial 'expose' of abuse in 
              the <i>gurukulas </i>did not occur as a result of external investigations, 
              although I am aware of the investigations that were done in Texas 
              years ago. Nevertheless what I am saying is that ISKCON people began 
              talking about this within ISKCON. This was something very internal.</p>
            <p>There are a series of questions here. What is being done, what 
              has been done, what is being done for those who have been abused? 
              How were, and are perpetrators handled? If there are perpetrators 
              in the future, how will they be handled? The whole issue is there, 
              for example, of reporting to police. In Pennsylvania, if you are 
              a registered clergy person you are mandated to report allegations 
              of child abuse. You are mandated by law to report abuse to the Department 
              of Human Services, or you can be criminally liable. So I am curious, 
              as are a lot of people here, about those issues.</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> There is an increasing understanding of the 
              problem of child abuse in the past, and the potential for it in 
              the present. Just to highlight some of those steps: In 1990, the 
              Governing Body passed a series of resolutions specifically mandating 
              that any allegations or suspicions of child abuse have to be reported 
              to the local authorities. Preliminary screening processes were put 
              into place, as I mentioned earlier. Statistics now demonstrate that 
              across the board for any group, the boarding school environment 
              is a vulnerable one. The farther the kids are from their parents 
              the more risk is involved. We learned the hard way on that one. 
              Again, the traditional Indian model is generally to live in the 
              <i>gurukula</i>, the school of the guru, away from home. But sometimes 
              this does not work, and we found that out. At least it did not work 
              for us.</p>
            <p>In 1996, there was a meeting of North American temple leaders where 
              ten former <i>gurukula </i>students were asked to speak. Many of 
              them had spoken previously with leaders on an individual level, 
              but this is the first time it had been done in an organised way. 
              Nine of the ten were victims of various degrees of abuse. As a result 
              of that meeting &#151; which was an eye-opening one for many people 
              including myself &#151; a group called 'Children of Krishna' was 
              established to collect funds and provide support for counselling, 
              educational needs, college grants and other programmes. A task force 
              was also set up about that time which generated the ISKCON Office 
              of Child Protection (OCP). That office is based in Florida and is 
              professionally staffed and led by a Krsna devotee who has a Ph.D. 
              in social work and has worked with the State of Florida for several 
              years, in the field of family and child issues.</p>
            <p>The Office of Child Protection has three mandates: first, to assure 
              the continued development of programmes for protecting kids today; 
              second, to help young people (specifically those who were abused) 
              with grants; third, it has responsibility to investigate allegations 
              of past abuse. The list of alleged perpetrators is far greater than 
              we ever imagined. The OCP is going back to investigate those cases, 
              and even where legal action cannot be taken &#151; because of the 
              passage of time or other reasons &#151; to do its own investigation. 
              It then determines what restrictions are placed on an alleged perpetrator's 
              involvement with ISKCON. For example, one of the first OCP cases 
              involved a Krsna devotee who sexually abused his stepdaughter and 
              served time in jail. The OCP office investigated and determined 
              that although this individual had 'paid his dues to society' at 
              large, we still choose to regulate his access to our temples. I 
              don't remember all the exact restrictions, but this man is not allowed 
              to visit temples unless he first notifies the local temple president. 
              He cannot visit a temple if his former wife or stepdaughter is there 
              or if they are active in that community. He can never hold an official 
              position in ISKCON in the future; he can never give scriptural class, 
              etc. So we are putting those types of things in place. I wish it 
              had been done a lot earlier. </p>
            <p><b>Dubrow-Eichel:</b> I am not sure who this question was intended 
              for but I think it is for anyone on the panel. There are individuals 
              who were picketing outside this Conference that accuse AFF of promoting 
              hate theories and things like that. What are your thoughts about 
              that message versus what is happening in here?</p>
            <p><b>Anuttama Dasa:</b> I feel that there are legitimate critiques 
              that this organisation puts forth about human behaviour in general. 
              Religious groups or certain organisations, by their structure, by 
              their theoretical basis, may be more vulnerable for excesses, abuse, 
              mistakes or whatever. I am a member of a religious tradition that 
              has a great and legitimate history going back thousands of years 
              in India. However, because of its being a new organisation and because 
              it demands a high degree of commitment, it has been vulnerable to 
              abuses. It has ongoing issues that its international communities 
              &#151; which are sometimes relatively isolated &#151; need to be 
              more aware of. We need to understand what the potential problems 
              are, so that the same mistakes that we made, primarily in America, 
              are not repeated. There is beneficial information that you offer 
              that we can learn from. </p>
            <p>At the same time, I am absolutely convinced that the earlier critiques 
              of ISKCON, as I understood them &#151; which were based on the old 
              model of a 'dangerous cult' and which categorised ISKCON members 
              as the victims of mind control or whatever because we wear strange 
              dress, chant mantras, and are vegetarian &#151; is wrong. It is 
              also wrong if people in my organisation say that anyone who criticises 
              us and says we are 'cultic', is not worth listening to. I think 
              the model that has been presented at this conference, that looks 
              at a spectrum of human interaction from healthy to unhealthy, makes 
              perfect sense, and any organisation needs to be open to that.</p>
            <p>David Clark mentioned yesterday on his panel that the current understanding 
              of exit counselling has developed a higher degree of respect for 
              the integrity and free choice of the individual. So, even within 
              the paradigms that this organisation is wrestling with, as far as 
              group dynamics and undue influence, and in counselling people involved 
              in questionable groups, there is room for improvement. I come in 
              the spirit that ISKCON, as an organisation, has a lot of room for 
              improvement. There may be very useful information in some of the 
              studies and the information that AFF presents. I do not accept it 
              all, but we do agree on many things.</p>
            <p><b>Kelly:</b> I agree with so much of what you are saying, yet 
              I am curious about what real influence you and Radha and others 
              interested in reform are having on the GBC. Are they listening to 
              you? Is there an openness in your community?</p>
            <p><b>Radha Dasi:</b> Well, there is a number of dynamics. I think 
              there are definitely very, very, influential members in the GBC 
              who are wholeheartedly behind these changes and, for example, speaking 
              out on the women's issue. There are certain leaders who have opened 
              the doors wide, who have travelled the world preaching to various 
              congregations, and are really making an effort to see that changes 
              are made. In addition, there are some institutional and cultural 
              things that are happening that make change inevitable. For example, 
              we have moved from the celibate-student-monk model to the independent-householder 
              model. When you have your own family, your own house and your own 
              job, then inherently the ability of the guru, or the ability of 
              the Temple President, to manipulate and control people is much less. 
              Also, because the financial resources of the organisation are less, 
              the power of institutional leaders over individual members is less. 
              We also have a manpower shortage in many places at this point. It 
              is forcing management to say, 'Look, we better treat our people 
              well.' </p>
            <p>The problem is not, as you know, that we have so many people, or 
              that we are getting so many recruits, and we are getting all of 
              their money. It is not working that way anymore. So we are learning 
              that we have to treat people well. We have to help them develop 
              their skills and their abilities so that they can contribute. When 
              young people come to me and say, 'You are a role model and we would 
              like your advice &#151; what should I do about college?' I say, 
              'Go!' I say get an advanced degree, get two advanced degrees. My 
              son is so tired of hearing about career choices and going to college. 
              I do not care what the traditional model of the group was. Things 
              are changing. As a culture we are changing, as an institution we 
              are changing. So I think the positive reforms are inevitable. The 
              question is whether it is going to be a painful process of making 
              those reforms, or whether it is going to be a more pleasant process, 
              a more co-operative process.</p>
            <p><b>Dubrow-Eichel:</b> I want to make a couple of comments oriented 
              toward the panel and toward the audience as a whole. I actually 
              asked Michael if I could be a part of this panel when it was first 
              proposed. I told him I would really enjoy doing this. I did not 
              mention at the beginning of the introductions that my doctoral dissertation 
              was both an observational and, with use of a quasi-experimental 
              statistical approach, an intensive examination of a deprogramming, 
              in 1984, of an ISKCON devotee. So, I had a personal fascination 
              with this topic and with the idea of change. </p>
            <p>Having been involved in the field of cultic studies I &#151; along 
              with a number of people, certainly Michael and Joe, and a lot of 
              people in the audience &#151; have seen that a tremendous amount 
              of change has occurred within the critical community. I do not like 
              using the term anti-cult because it denotes a monolithic structure 
              that I have certainly not seen, not recently anyway. But certainly 
              within the critical community, there has been a lot of change that 
              has occurred over the years. The Exit Counseling Panel yesterday 
              certainly brought that forth in a way that was, at least from my 
              point of view, pretty open and honest about where things have gone 
              as the progression from deprogramming to exit counselling to thought 
              reform. </p>
            <p>I am fascinated with the idea or notion that groups that have been 
              criticised for being cultic, or abusive, can change. I think change 
              is inevitable but that does not mean that change is necessarily 
              always positive. Change can certainly be negative, but change is 
              inevitable. My hope is that this panel, and the questions and the 
              answers and the dialogue that occurred here, will be a beginning. 
              I hope no one will walk away from this panel thinking, yes, I now 
              know what is going on within ISKCON, or within AFF; now I have made 
              up my mind about AFF being this way and ISKCON being that way. I 
              hope that we leave here with an increased interest in continuing 
              dialogue and with perhaps a clearer understanding.</p>
            <p>I have never known AFF to 'certify a group as being cultic or non-cultic'. 
              I have found a lot of dissent over the years about where a particular 
              group falls on a continuum of psychological or spiritual abuse. 
              My guess is that there is going to be some additional dissent based 
              on this panel. I really hope that there will be ongoing discussion. 
              Speaking now very personally, just from my own set of values, I 
              feel very strongly that change is an inevitable evolutionary process. 
              I agree very strongly with what you said, Radha, about people needing 
              to seek their path. I would even go beyond that and say that organisations 
              and movements need to seek a path. No organisation that I am aware 
              of has ever gone along the path and not stumbled or been turned 
              around in a direction that maybe later on they wish they had done 
              differently. Thank you very much.</p>
