            <span class="maintextsubhead">Author: K. P. Sinha<br>
            Publisher: Punthi-Pustak, Calcutta, 1997<br>
            ISBN: 81-86791-09-4 </span> 
            <p>The aim of this book is to discredit Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Prabhupada's presentation of the Vedic literature, and indirectly 
              the Gaudiya-Vedanta viewpoint. In its place, the author Dr K.P. 
              Sinha, professor of Sanskrit at Assam University, presents Neo-Vedanta 
              as the complete and authoritative solution to all philosophical 
              and hermeneutic problems in Indian philosophy. The term 'Neo-Vedanta' 
              refers to the loosely organised, relativistic system that attempts 
              to reconcile the views of all the Indian philosophical schools into 
              a single, coherent system. This system emerged primarily from the 
              teachings of the 19[th] century Hindu teacher Ramakrishna and others 
              like Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan who popularised this trend of 
              thought in modern Hinduism.<a name="101"></a><a href="#01">[1]</a> 
              Although Sinha never uses the term 'Neo-Vedanta' it is unmistakably 
              his approach.</p>
            <p>Sinha's book quotes two-hundred and fifty passages from Srila Prabhupada's 
              books, taken primarily from his commentaries on the <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>and <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. In 16 chapters organised 
              by topic, they are subsequently addressed point by point from a 
              Neo-Vedantic perspective. Prabhupada's positions on Brahman, monism 
              (<i>advaita</i>), knowledge (<i>jnana</i>), devotion (<i>bhakti</i>), 
              illusion (<i>vivarta-vada</i>) and various heterodox schools are 
              challenged with an abundance of references to a wide range of Vedic 
              literature, secondary literature and their commentaries.</p>
            <p>The central argument of the book is that Prabhupada has not really 
              understood the catholic viewpoint of the Vedic literature and has 
              consequently made many needless 'misinterpretations and unkind remarks' 
              against non-Vaisnava systems, particularly 'the Mayavadis' &#151; 
              teachers of Advaita and Neo-Vedanta. The book's stated purpose is 
              therefore 'to undertake the task of pointing out those misinterpretations 
              and giving the correct views of the relevant concepts of the systems 
              concerned ... to remove the evil effects these misinterpretations 
              and unkind remarks tend to create in the hearts of readers of Bhaktivedanta's 
              discourses.'<a name="102"></a><a href="#02">[2]</a> His underlying 
              thesis is that Srila Prabhupada's books represent Vaisnava sectarianism 
              which needs to be re-evaluated in the light of an all-inclusive 
              framework.</p>
            <p>The nature of Sinha's own Neo-Vedanta outlook itself is clarified 
              by viewing it in the context of Indian philosophical history. The 
              last millennium has seen many debates between the non-personal monistic 
              school (<i>advaita</i>) and the dualistic, personalistic (Vaisnava) 
              schools. While all sides agree that the ultimate reality called 
              Brahman is of one nature, the monistic school of <i>advaita </i>contends 
              that it is of a non-personal nature and that God's personality is 
              illusory and of secondary importance. On the other hand, each of 
              the personalistic Vaisnava schools describe Brahman as the intensely 
              personal being called Visnu, or Krsna, having an infinity of auspicious 
              attributes. In monism, God and the soul are identical, while in 
              dualism the difference is maintained even after liberation. The 
              monistic school has often enjoyed prestige as the primary Vedanta 
              school. However, throughout history, the Vaisnava schools have attempted 
              to demonstrate the coherency and strength of their devotional theology 
              on the basis of Vedic literature while criticising the monistic 
              two-tier theory of truth. </p>
            <p>In response to this rich polemical tradition, the proponents of 
              Neo-Vedanta attempted to incorporate the advantages of both by artificially 
              combining the opposing conceptions into a single dual-natured Brahman. 
              Neo-Vedanta, they said, is the ultimate resolution to the <i>advaita-</i>versus-Vaisnava 
              controversy with the potential of becoming a universal philosophy. 
              Neo-Vedanta was then hailed as 'a grand ideal' of religious harmony 
              and the 'death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecution with 
              the sword or with the pen'.<a name="103"></a><a href="#03">[3]</a> 
              In his preface, Sinha announces his intention to demonstrate the 
              same ideal in the course of his analysis of Prabhupada's writings. 
            </p>
            <p>Specifically, Sinha's Neo-Vedanta accepts both the personal and 
              the non-personal aspects on equal footing in what has been described 
              as 'a many-faceted Personal-Impersonal Absolute Being'. Both principles 
              are said to coexist harmoniously like 'two sides of a coin'.<a name="104"></a><a href="#04">[4]</a> 
              Using Ramakrishna's example, he says, 'Just as the same substance 
              may manifest itself as water or ice depending on the degree of temperature.'<a name="105"></a><a href="#05">[5]</a> 
              Both exist with the same reality and validity with respect to two 
              different frames of reference. When one aspect (the personal natures 
              of God and the souls) is experienced, the other (the monistic aspect) 
              is not, and vice-versa.<a name="106"></a><a href="#06">[6]</a> This 
              system is promoted by Neo-Vedantists as the real philosophy of the 
              <i>Veda,</i> and in its support Sinha cites both monistic and personalistic 
              sources profusely. </p>
            <p>Since all of Prabhupada's writings are critiqued consistently from 
              Sinha's perspective, it is useful to examine his Neo-Vedanta. The 
              most obvious problem with Sinha's presentation is its mishandling 
              of both monistic and Vaisnava texts. </p>
            <p>Sri Caitanya (1486-1534) of the Vaisnava tradition has been blatantly 
              misrepresented. Although He accepted the reality of the monism, 
              He clearly rejected it as an object of meditation, or a goal of 
              spiritual life. Over-emphasis of the non-personal aspect covers 
              the spiritual opulences (<i>cid-vibhuti</i>) of the Lord in the 
              name of impersonalism (<i>nirakara</i>).<a name="107"></a><a href="#07">[7]</a> 
              In that tradition Srila Prabhupada has faithfully rejected monism 
              as the goal of spiritual life. In his critique, however, Sinha in 
              effect pits Srila Prabhupada's views against those of Sri Caitanya, 
              whom he portrays as a Neo-Vedantist:</p>
            <p>...the differences between Sankara and Sri Caitanya are very little 
              and negligible. Hence, Sri Caitanya's ruthless criticism of Sankara 
              should be explained as an extravagance guided by his strong desire 
              to redirect men pursuing the philosophical path of knowledge to 
              the emotional path of <i>bhakti</i>.<a name="108"></a><a href="#08">[8]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>Sinha proceeds to misinterpret esoteric dualistic states of devotional 
              ecstasy in Gaudiya-Vaisnava literature like <i>mahabhava </i>and 
              <i>prema-vilasa-vivarta </i>as essentially non-personalistic experiences<a name="109"></a><a href="#09">[9]</a>. 
              This attempt to support his dual-Brahman theory is unconvincing, 
              because the Gaudiya Vedanta commentary does not even refer to an 
              independent non-personal Brahman as envisaged in Neo-Vedanta. The 
              Gaudiya school does, however, acknowledge a non-personal effulgence 
              (called <i>tejas </i>or <i>jyoti</i>) resting entirely on the foundation 
              (<i>pratistha</i>) of God's personality.<a name="110"></a><a href="#10">[10]</a> 
              The personal feature, however, is exalted as the highly concentrated 
              source of the non-personal Brahman.<a name="111"></a><a href="#11">[11]</a> 
              Jiva Goswami, a contemporary follower of Sri Caitanya, however, 
              clarifies the personalism of Gaudiya philosophy: 'Bhagavan is, however, 
              the original feature of the Supreme, and Brahman is manifested at 
              a later time from the form of Bhagavan.'<a name="112"></a><a href="#12">[12]</a> 
              Gaudiya Vaisnavas also cite the <i>Bhagavata Purana, </i>which relates 
              to us how Arjuna became aware of the non-personal effulgence (<i>param 
              jyoti</i>) as it emanated from the personal Brahman, clarifying 
              the actual relationship of these two aspects of Brahman.<a name="113"></a><a href="#13">[13]</a> 
              Therefore, Sinha's presentation of Sri Caitanya and His followers 
              as Neo-Vedantists is misleading.</p>
            <p>Sankara (788 ce), founder of the monistic (<i>advaita</i>) school, 
              has also been utterly misrepresented by Sinha, He states, 'The philosophy 
              of Sankara has two currents: When he speaks strictly as a philosopher, 
              he points his attention to the formless and qualityless Brahman 
              ... when he speaks as a devotee, he directs his attention to the 
              divine beauty of ... the emotional Absolute. All this clearly shows 
              that Sankara accepts the existence of Purusottam Krsna, the Personal 
              Absolute'.<a name="114"></a><a href="#14">[14]</a> This sort of 
              mispresentation of the monism of Sankara by other Neo-Vedantists 
              has drawn severe criticism from the Dvaita scholar B.N.K. Sharma, 
              whose comments are equally applicable to Sinha's presentation:</p>
            <p>This picture is however far from being correct or true to Sankara's 
              own clear pronouncements in his <i>Brahma-sutra-bhasya,</i> or even 
              logically consistent. Sankara's pronouncements on the status of 
              Saguna and Nirguna Brahmans and the factual existence of the world 
              ... give no support to any of the articles of faith of 'Neo-Vedanta' 
              [in which] the Saguna and Nirguna Brahmans have been placed on the 
              same par as the two sides of the same coin having the same reality 
              and validity. After crying down [Sankara's] two-tier theory of truth, 
              it is a surreptitious way of introducing it again by way of 'different 
              frames of reference'.<a name="115"></a><a href="#15">[15]</a></p>
            <p>The idea of the Savisesa [personal] and Nirvisesa [non-personal] 
              Brahman both having the same reality and validity as the two sides 
              of the same coin or the vast liquidity of the Ocean and the solid 
              icebergs in another part has been severely criticised by Sankara 
              under his Vedanta commentary 2.1.14 (<i>na canekatmakam</i>). He 
              argues that the Supreme Brahman can never be <i>anekatmakam</i> 
              (double-sided) like the coin with two sides (as Neo-Vedanta wants 
              us to believe). Sankara thunders, 'Nonduality will have nothing 
              to do with accommodating difference of states of experience of Saguna 
              and Nirguna from different frames of reference at any time in its 
              being'(2.1.14). 'Brahman cannot be intrinsically double-natured 
              (<i>na svata eva anekatmakam</i>) as the two natures are diametrically 
              opposed to each other (<i>virodha</i>)...' Lastly, the Upanisadic 
              thesis of <i>ekavijnanena satvavijnanam </i>(knowing the many by 
              knowing the One) will be disproved and falsified, if it were true 
              that when the one [aspect of Brahman] is known the other is not.<a name="116"></a><a href="#16">[16]</a></p>
            <p>Indeed, Sankara unambiguously denies a dual-natured Brahman and 
              condemns the devotional relation: </p>
            <p>Brahman must be held to be altogether without form, not at the 
              same time of an opposite nature ... Brahman does not possess double 
              characteristics although it is connected with limiting adjuncts. 
              Nor is it possible that Brahman should possess double characteristics 
              'on account of place'. ... If the conception of duality is once 
              uprooted by the conception of absolute unity, it cannot arise again, 
              and so [it can] no longer be the cause of Brahman being looked upon 
              as the complementary object of injunctions of devotion.<a name="117"></a><a href="#17">[17]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>It should also be noted that Sankara and the monists teach the 
              unique doctrine of illusionism (<i>mithyatva</i>) that, strictly 
              speaking, regards the world and individuality as completely illusory, 
              or non-existent. Neo-Vedanta, however, while liberally using the 
              language of the monists, sees them as merely temporary.<a name="118"></a><a href="#18">[18]</a> 
              This dilution of illusionism from indicating unreality to a transient 
              reality clearly signals a departure from classical monistic metaphysics 
              of Advaita.</p>
            <p>Also common in the book is his frequent appeal to Sankara's discussion 
              in <i>Vedanta-sutra</i> 4.4.12 about how a liberated soul can animate 
              several bodies at once or live without a body. Using this, Sinha 
              tries to prove that Advaita philosophy accommodates his dual-natured 
              liberation and Brahman theory.<a name="119"></a><a href="#19">[19]</a> 
              However, it is clear from context that those 'bodies' exist not 
              in spiritual perfection but only in the lower illusory (<i>vyavaharika</i>) 
              state of monistic philosophy.<a name="120"></a><a href="#20">[20]</a></p>
            <p>Sinha's critique also fails to recognise the partial Vaisnava character 
              of even Sankara's major commentaries by proposing that the deities 
              Kali and Siva are also complete aspects of Brahman, in addition 
              to Visnu. However, in his unquestionably authentic works, Sankara 
              only identifies God (<i>isvara</i>) as Visnu, rather than as any 
              other deity. In his <i>Gita </i>commentary (13.2), <i>isvara</i> 
              is identified with Visnu: <i>isvarasya visnoh</i>. Another identification 
              occurs in <i>Vedanta-sutra </i>2.2.42, where he accepts the Pancaratra 
              teaching that Narayana is 'higher than the undeveloped, the highest 
              Self and the Self of all' and is the source of innumerable expansions. 
              (See also similar acknowledgements in his comments to <i>Vedanta-sutra</i> 
              1.4.1, 1.4.3 and <i>Gita </i>15.6.) The same idea is repeatedly 
              expressed in his exaltation of Visnu's abode as the pure highest 
              place (<i>paramam padam</i>) and as the end of the spiritual journey.<a name="121"></a><a href="#21">[21]</a> 
              Even his commentary to the <i>Svetasvatara Upanisad</i>, with its 
              usage of the names 'Siva' and 'Hara', does not make any identification 
              of Isvara with the deity Siva. Furthermore, in his <i>Vedanta</i> 
              commentary, Sankara refutes certain concepts of ancient Pasupata 
              (Saiva) schools. Therefore, Sinha's presentation of Sankara acknowledging 
              an equality of various deities is misleading. </p>
            <p>In summary, Sinha's approach is wrong and disingenuous, as it puts 
              Adi Sankara and his followers against each other on many fundamental 
              issues. The integrity of Sinha's approach to Sankara, therefore, 
              collapses in light of the foregoing evidences of his clearly monistic 
              position. </p>
            <p>Not only is Sinha's presentation of other <i>acaryas </i>inaccurate, 
              but his Neo-Vedanta philosophy itself has certain problems. He frequently 
              states that upon liberation, the soul 'may merge into the body of 
              the Absolute.'<a name="122"></a><a href="#22">[22]</a> Specifically, 
              this concept of 'merging' or the literal dissolution of one's identity 
              into the non-personal Brahman closely resembles, as noted insightfully 
              by B.N.K. Sharma, that of ancient philosophy of <i>bhedabheda. </i>This 
              doctrine of 'difference &#151; non-difference' was rejected by all 
              the Vedanta schools.<a name="123"></a><a href="#23">[23]</a> While 
              Vaisnava schools accept difference (<i>bheda</i>) and only a relative 
              oneness (<i>abheda</i>) or similarity between the soul and God, 
              this <i>bhedabheda </i>doctrine calls for an absolute oneness and 
              difference, as does Neo-Vedanta.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the classical <i>bhedabheda</i> of Bhaskara holds 
              that <i>bheda </i>and <i>abheda</i> are sequential: the initially 
              distinct (<i>bheda</i>) infinitesimal soul can, upon liberation, 
              become identical to the unlimited Brahman (<i>abheda</i>). This 
              concept of spiritual mutability is fundamentally at odds with Vedic 
              philosophy since it indirectly challenges the infallibility of Brahman 
              by allowing for change, thereby dragging the pure Brahman conception 
              down into the gutter of imperfection.<a name="124"></a><a href="#24">[24]</a> 
              This has been the perennial charge against <i>bhedabheda</i>, and 
              as a variant, Neo-Vedanta is also subject to the same criticism.</p>
            <p>In addition to this sequential view, Sinha and other Neo-Vedantists 
              also accept both <i>bheda</i> and <i>abheda</i> in a different sense. 
              Sinha states the soul 'may merge into the body of the Absolute or 
              may retain its individuality, according to the self's choice or 
              liking'. Whichever 'choice' the soul makes, both <i>bheda</i> and 
              <i>abheda</i> are supposedly simultaneously operative in liberation, 
              the terms merely reflecting differences in perspective.<a name="125"></a><a href="#25">[25]</a> 
              However, this attempt to project such a dual-natured liberation 
              theory into any Vaisnava-Vedanta is unacceptable, because the devotional 
              relation (<i>bhakti</i>) in such a system is compromised as insubstantial 
              and unreal in the monistic 'frame of reference'. This flaw is pointed 
              out by the Dvaita-Vaisnava-Vedantist Raghunatha Tirtha (1695-1742): 
              the <i>bheda</i> component of this <i>bhedabheda-vada </i>'offers 
              no impediment to the <i>jiva's </i>intuiting the blessedness of 
              Brahman as his own, as [the difference] exists only in a rarefied 
              form in the state of liberation and is as good as non-existent.'<a name="#126"></a><a href="#26">[26]</a> 
              Thus, <i>bhedabheda</i> in both variants essentially rejects <i>bheda</i> 
              and the proper understanding of <i>abheda</i>, and, consequently, 
              the <i>bhakti</i> relation. Therefore, Neo-Vedanta, as a modern 
              form of <i>bhedabheda</i> is fundamentally hostile to pure devotion 
              (<i>bhakti</i>) and can never be consistent with any Vaisnava-Vedanta 
              framework.</p>
            <p>After refuting some salient points of variants of <i>bhedabheda 
              </i>philosophy, the Sri Vaisnava <i>acarya</i> Ramanuja (1017-1137) 
              concludes: </p>
            <p>Brahman becomes, on this theory, subject to the evil of conjunction 
              with an infinite number of limiting conditions without any determinate 
              localisation of effects. There is no way of escaping this consequence. 
              The theory is only for the consumption of believers and can withstand 
              no open-minded inquiry. The wise, learned in the philosophical sciences, 
              do not have any esteem for it.<a name="127"></a><a href="#27">[27]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>He goes so far as to indicate that <i>bhedabheda</i> and its variations 
              are more sinful than classical Advaita.<a name="128"></a><a href="#28">[28]</a> 
              However that may be, Neo-Vedanta suffers from the same philosophical 
              problems.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Sinha's critique promotes Ramakrishna as a Vedantin, 
              even referring to him rather uncritically as an incarnation (<i>avatara</i>) 
              of God.<a name="129"></a><a href="#29">[29]</a> Jeffrey J. Kripal's 
              intriguing work <i>Kali's Child: The Mystical and The Erotic in 
              the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna </i>deconstructs the Ramakrishna 
              myth revealing little more than an unorthodox tantric sexuality 
              at the basis of his life, sayings, practices, and even literary 
              styles of his biographers.<a name="130"></a><a href="#30">[30]</a> 
              In both the Tantra traditions and Neo-Vedanta, the Brahman conception 
              suffers from spiritual mutability since both traditions maintain 
              real individual can literally dissolve its identity into a monistic 
              perfection, as in the <i>bhedabheda </i>doctrine. For whatever reason, 
              Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and modern proponents like Sinha have never 
              bothered to address standing objections as they re-introduced the 
              concept of spiritual mutability. </p>
            <p>Using his Neo-Vedantic prism, Sinha quotes and interprets passages 
              of Pancaratra literature to support his concept of dual-Brahman. 
              However, not only does Vaisnava personalism candidly dominate the 
              Pancaratra literature, but even terms like <i>nirguna </i>and <i>sayujya, 
              </i>commonly understood monistically, are defined in the Vaisnava 
              sense: 'Because [Brahman] has no contact with any ordinary qualities, 
              it is called <i>nirguna</i>. Listen, Narada, to the six [transcendental] 
              qualities.'<a name="131"></a><a href="#31">[31]</a> 'He who has 
              become attached to the jewel of gems (<i>maniratna</i>, the <i>kaustubha</i>) 
              is said to have attained identity with the Lord' (<i>Visnu-tilaka 
              </i>2.45).<a name="132"></a><a href="#32">[32]</a> 'Just as gold 
              in the midst of fire shines separately as though it were not in 
              contact (with the fire), even so he who is clinging to Brahman (Brahman-lagna) 
              is seen to exist in the form of a gem (<i>mani</i>)' (<i>Visnu-tilaka 
              </i>2.30). In the<i> Padma-tantra </i>(1.4.14-15), this very issue 
              is addressed: 'What is the difference, O Highest Spirit, between 
              Thee and the liberated soul?' The answer, starting off with a monistic 
              flavour, says, 'They (the liberated) become "I". There is no difference 
              whatsoever,' but ends by affirming plurality in perfection: 'As 
              I live (<i>viharami</i>), just so live the liberated souls.'<a name="133"></a><a href="#33">[33]</a> 
              Such passages affirm the Vaisnava character of even the apparently 
              monistic statements of the Pancaratra.</p>
            <p>In section thirteen, Sinha criticises Srila Prabhupada's explanation 
              of the spiritual nature of Lord Krsna's body. Specifically, Sinha 
              suggests that at the time of descent into this world, the transcendental 
              body of the Lord becomes embodied in a visually similar body of 
              flesh and blood. This interpretation is specifically rejected by 
              Vaisnava Vedantists, because it relies on an inapplicable and mundane 
              interpretation of '<i>sambhavami</i>' (literally, 'I take birth') 
              of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 4.6. Even Sankaracarya, who ultimately rejects 
              all material and spiritual form as illusory, explains the word in 
              the proper way: 'I appear to become embodied (<i>dehavan iva</i>), 
              as though born (<i>jata iva</i>); ... but not in reality (<i>na 
              paramarthato</i>) like an ordinary man (<i>lokavat</i>).'<a name="134"></a><a href="#34">[34]</a> 
              Similarly, another famous Advaitin, Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati, explicitly 
              states that Lord Krsna's body is made of eternity, knowledge and 
              bliss (<i>sac-cid-ananda-ghana</i>) and is manifested (<i>avirbhavah</i>) 
              even at the time of His birth (<i>janmakale</i>) (4.6, 7.24).<a name="135"></a><a href="#35">[35]</a> 
              Interestingly, S. Radhakrishnan, another Neo-Vedantist, recognizing 
              this classical interpretation, rejected it as 'unsatisfactory', 
              offering the same mundane explanation of Krsna's which is repeated 
              by Sinha.</p>
            <p> Throughout his book, Sinha claims to champion the cause of pure 
              non-sectarian <i>Vedanta,</i> but even this claim is thrown into 
              question in his concluding sections (chapters 14-16) which attempt 
              to harmonise non-Vedic doctrines with <i>Vedanta</i>. For example, 
              the materialistic philosophy of Carvaka is presented as respectable 
              and conducive to morality and social harmony, despite clear pronouncements 
              by Lord Krsna to the contrary in <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>(16.8).<a name="136"></a><a href="#36">[36]</a> 
              Then he presents and accedes to Buddhist arguments against <i>Vedanta.</i> 
              One such concession is the denial of the eternality of the <i>Veda</i> 
              in its linguistic format.<a name="137"></a><a href="#37">[37]</a> 
              The universally accepted <i>Vedanta</i> viewpoint, however, is expressed 
              in the <i>Brahmanda Purana</i>: 'The <i>Vedas</i> are eternal, in 
              their entirety; are enduring, and present in the mind of Visnu; 
              at creation after creation, they are brought up as they are; with 
              the same order, same characters, and the same notes, never otherwise.'<a name="138"></a><a href="#38">[38]</a> 
              Sinha also defends the Buddhist contention that their state of perfection 
              (<i>sunya</i>) is not merely an absolute void, but a state of positive 
              bliss. However, this overlooks the fact that the Buddhist definition 
              of <i>sunya </i>and Vedantic definition of <i>asat </i>(non-existence) 
              are, in fact, similar.<a name="139"></a><a href="#39">[39]</a> Sinha 
              also accepts their view that the absolute truth lies midway between 
              nihilism (<i>sunyavada</i>) and eternalism (<i>sasvatavada</i>) 
              and, inaccurately, concludes that this final state is consistent 
              with Brahman realisation of Advaita. Thus, the philosophy of Sinha, 
              like those of Ramakrishna and other Neo-Vedantists before him, ultimately 
              accomodates materialism, impersonality, personality, nihilistic 
              void, and anything and everything else &#151; all in one relativistic 
              system.</p>
            <p>Ravindra-svarupa Dasa sums up the substance of Neo-Vedanta: </p>
            <p>Those who have adopted traditional Advaita Vedanta to modern sorts 
              of relativism have introduced a change that we should note carefully. 
              ... The thinkers who have 'deepened' Sankaracarya's relativism have 
              done away with an established illusion. No specific revelation carries 
              universal authority, even provisionally. As I once heard a college 
              girl say, expressing the popular rendition of this 'deepening': 
              'If you believe it's true, it's true for you.' Thus the modern, 
              deracinated individual becomes the author of reality, of creation. 
              He is now set free to believe in everything whatsoever precisely 
              because he believes in nothing at all.<a name="140"></a><a href="#40">[40]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>Sinha's major criticism of Prabhupada's supposed misrepresentation 
              of others has several other bases. One possible source is that Srila 
              Prabhupada uses the term 'Mayavada' broadly to refer to both classical 
              monism of Sankara as well as Neo-Vedanta, since both see illusion 
              (<i>maya</i>) as a relatively independent principle. Therefore, 
              each of his criticisms of 'Mayavada' do not necessarily apply to 
              both types. Another possible source is how Srila Prabhupada not 
              only criticises the face-value of monism but also for what is, in 
              his view, its logical extensions and indirect results like materialism.<a name="141"></a><a href="#41">[41]</a> 
              In fact, the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>(12.5) affirms the relative difficulty 
              of meditation on the non-personal aura of Brahman, and the failure 
              in this path naturally results in materialism. Another cause of 
              misgivings is Srila Prabhupada's writing style, which is spiced 
              with humour, sarcasm, and contemporary socio-religious criticism. 
              In particular, his sharp remarks against very reputable philosophical 
              opponents like Sankara, Vivekananda, and Radhakrishnan are criticised 
              by Sinha as 'unparliamentary'.<a name="142"></a><a href="#42">[42]</a> 
              However, when seen in context, these remarks shatter the sentimentalism 
              of secular religion and provoke analytical thought in his readers. 
              It should be noted that Srila Prabhupada was personally very respectful 
              to all his opponents including Radhakrishnan. </p>
            <p>Sinha validly notes several minor points in Srila Prabhupada's 
              books. One is the latter's reference to Sankara as equating Lord 
              Sankarsana with the individual soul (<i>jiva</i>) in his <i>Vedanta-sutra 
              </i>2.2.42 commentary.<a name="143"></a><a href="#43">[43]</a> Although 
              Sankara here draws no equation between the two alternate referents, 
              it is a natural conclusion of monism and Srila Prabhupada's ensuing 
              argument against this conclusion is generally applicable. In another 
              case, the definitions of <i>vikara </i>and <i>vivarta </i>used to 
              explain the theory of transformation (<i>parinama-vada</i>) is incorrectly 
              attributed to the <i>Vedanta-sutra</i>. However, these definitions 
              are general and accepted by all Vedanta schools, and therefore Srila 
              Prabhupada's use of them is valid.<a name="144"></a><a href="#44">[44]</a> 
              These instances do not detract from Srila Prabhupada's overall presentation 
              of the Vaisnava viewpoint.</p>
            <p>In summary, Sinha's critique of Srila Prabhupada's works amounts 
              to a presentation of the relativistic Neo-Vedanta outlook with its 
              underlying hostility towards the fundamental truth of <i>bhakti</i> 
              as well as Vedanta. Although he ambitiously cites an impressive 
              array of Vedic and Saivite texts, he disingenuously invokes the 
              names of Sankaracarya and Sri Caitanya to support his philosophy 
              and, like others before him, fails to address the universal objections 
              to spiritual mutability. Nevertheless, this Neo-Vedantic challenge 
              to Vaisnavism will be of interest to ISKCON devotees currently involved 
              in dialogue with adherents of modern Hindu philosophy.</p>
