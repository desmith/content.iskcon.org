            <p>'For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same 
              My Name is great among the nations and in every place offerings 
              are presented to My Name, even pure obligations, for My Name is 
              great among the nations, says the Lord of Hosts.' So wrote the prophet 
              Malachi around 2,500 years ago, expressing the Biblical Jewish understanding, 
              adopted by many modern Jews, that there are many valid paths to 
              communion with the One God that we have each chosen to worship in 
              our own particular way.</p>
            <p>So it was with deep, spiritual delight that I read in the ISKCON 
              Declaration that 'no one religion holds the monopoly on the truth, 
              the revelation of God or our relationship with God.'</p>
            <p>It seems that there are three different views that religious people 
              might hold of other faiths. The first view, presented in 'ISKCON 
              in Relation to People of Faith in God' as the position of the neophyte, 
              is one of 'exclusivism and fanaticism'. There are many Jews, sadly 
              locked into this position, who regard other faiths as inferior or 
              idolatrous and therefore religious abominations. Mind you, they 
              often also regard their fellow Jews, who inhabit the more liberal 
              wing of our faith, in the same, if not even crueller, negative way! 
              One eminent Reform rabbi was described by a leading Orthodox rabbi 
              as a 'destroyer of the Faith'.</p>
            <p>Then there is the relativist view, held by many in the modern world, 
              of 'pick your own' religions. This includes those who believe that 
              it does not matter which religious path you follow, provided it 
              helps you lead a good ethical life with a spiritual dimension, and 
              also those who pick the bits they like from different faiths and 
              follow a mixture of their own choosing.</p>
            <p>The relativist approach may sound good, but I suspect that few 
              truly religious people feel it applies to their own faith. If all 
              paths are equally valid for all then why teach about and encourage 
              others to follow one particular path? It is very hard to be enthusiastic 
              about such a relativist system of beliefs or to have any success 
              in transmitting this to the next generation. The answer must be 
              that you feel the path you are on has something special, unique 
              and valuable to offer.</p>
            <p>So the third view seems 'truest' to experience. To understand that 
              there are truths to be found in other religions, and many values 
              and practices that can help you with your own faith questions, but 
              to accept that, just as you believe that your religion is best for 
              you, so others have the right to believe that their religion is 
              best for them. To me the image is one of a wheel. We live on the 
              hub, God is at the centre, there are many spokes leading to that 
              centre and usually, the best spoke is the one that starts near you!</p>
            <p>Here comes the nub, the question of conversion. Judaism, some 2,000 
              years ago, went through a conversionary period, and found that mass 
              conversion was not helpful. In the intervening period, conversion 
              to Judaism was a dangerous business. (In Christian medieval Europe 
              those converting to Judaism were often liable to execution, as was 
              the rabbi who helped, and the community was liable to expulsion. 
              This did not tend to encourage the com-munity to be open to such 
              things!) In the modern world, the orthodox Jewish community is still 
              very suspicious of those who wish to join us, but small numbers 
              do, every year. However, we do not go out seeking converts, that 
              is not part of our culture. We believe that good people of all faiths 
              will have a place in 'The World to Come' and therefore we do not 
              feel any religious need to pursue a proactive role in conversions.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we are a tiny group. We have not yet made up 
              the numbers lost in the Holocaust. In Great Britain, we number about 
              200,000 souls. Any attempts made to convert our young and vulnerable 
              are therefore met with dismay. And, with the appalling level of 
              Jewish education in this country, and because of the open nature 
              of the society in which we live, there are many young Jews who are 
              attracted to the religions of the East, unaware that they could 
              find almost everything they seek within their own rich heritage, 
              if only they knew where to go.</p>
            <p>So I am afraid that the early activities of the Hare Krishna movement 
              have led to a great deal of suspicion in the Jewish community, and 
              this may take some time to dissipate. True dialogue can only take 
              place among those who have no conversionary agenda, and those who 
              are secure in their own faiths. I note with relief and delight that 
              this is recognised in your declaration.</p>
            <p>God is so great. One of the Hebrew names for God is Ayn Sof, 'Without 
              End'. How can any religion imply that we know all there is to know, 
              that we have the one true path. We must acknowledge that there are 
              different paths that suit and/or challenge different people or cultures. 
              Let us thoroughly explore our own particular faiths and then in 
              friendship and respect, we can learn much from each other.</p>
