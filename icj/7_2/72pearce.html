            <p>As in previous issues, the <i>ISKCON Communications Journal </i>for 
              June 1999 contains a number of most interesting articles which show 
              how the movement is tackling in an open and determined way the challenges 
              which have to be faced in ISKCON's future development both internally 
              and in its external relationships. In view of my involvement in 
              interfaith work, I was particularly interested in the article by 
              Saunaka Rsi Dasa on 'ISKCON in Relation to People of Faith in God', 
              which sets out the Society's first official statement on its relationship 
              with those of other faiths. </p>
            <p>I am not qualified to comment on the theological exposition that 
              it offers as the basis for the guidelines it puts forward but I 
              found this part of the document both helpful and illuminating. It 
              will, I am sure, help to encourage others to have confidence in 
              their dialogue with the movement.</p>
            <p>It is welcome that the prologue to the document refers to the need 
              to be aware of the different strands within a religious tradition 
              as ancient and as wide as Hinduism. These ob-servations apply not 
              only to the Hindu tradition but to other major world faiths as well. 
              We always need to bear in mind that in dialogue we are meeting <i>people</i> 
              &#151; and people come from a particular part of their tradition 
              and speak out of their personal experience of it. We do not dialogue 
              with conceptual categories or concepts &#151; even if we often spend 
              our time together discussing them! </p>
            <p>People may meet in dialogue as 'representatives' of a tradition. 
              They may be authorised to speak on behalf of their communities, 
              but more often the hope will be that they can articulate the positions 
              which 'most' members of their community would take. It is always 
              important, for the benefit of their dialogue partners, for individuals 
              to make it clear when they are expressing personal views which are 
              not in accord with the majority view within their community.</p>
            <p>The ISKCON statement rightly recognises that if we are to build 
              a better society together then there is a need to build wide 'coalitions' 
              of people of moral purpose and integrity who hold key values in 
              common, even if they look to different sources for these. It is 
              very encouraging that the statement encourages ISKCON members to 
              think in these broad-ranging terms. The distinction the document 
              draws between seeking 'conversion' and 'spiritual development', 
              in encounters with those who do not follow the same path, is a valuable 
              one. Again, it is a distinction that can usefully be considered 
              by those in other religious traditions. The notion of mutual challenge 
              and the need to listen to one another in the hope of mutual enrichment 
              is central to the document. </p>
            <p>I was delighted to find in the text a number of echoes of the Inter 
              Faith Network's own document on<i> </i>'Building Good Relations 
              on People of Different Faiths and Beliefs'. I hope that other religious 
              communities and groups will produce their own statements of this 
              kind. It would be encouraging if these confirmed, as I believe that 
              they would, that there is much common ground between us on what 
              characterises appropriate and fruitful encounters between people 
              of different faiths.</p>
