            <p>In September 1998, a group of devotees and scholars attended a 
              one-day seminar in Abentheuer, Germany, entitled 'Puja: Different 
              Aspects of Worship in Religious Traditions'. It was envisioned that 
              these meetings would be held on a regular basis in the future, in 
              order to promote interfaith dialogue and facilitate in-depth study 
              of religious practices.</p>
            <p> Although the content of the seminar was originally planned to 
              deal with  Christianity and Vaisnavism, it was soon realised that 
              there were other interesting topics to be discussed which could 
              not be summarised under this general heading. It was therefore decided 
              to invite speakers to choose their own subjects, with an open discussion 
              after each presentation.</p>
            <p>The meeting opened with Dr Peter Schmidt, who discussed his thesis, 
              'A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami in Interreligious Dialogue.' Dr Schmidt 
              began by analysing Srila Prabhupada's view of Christianity, which 
              had been strongly influenced by Rev. Urquhart, his teacher at Scottish 
              Churches College. Dr. Schmidt illustrated how Srila Prabhupada used 
              many of Urquhart's less well-known terms to describe Christianity, 
              concluding that both men shared similarities in expression and theological 
              understanding. For example, Dr Schmidt pointed out that with his 
              acknowledgement of the Lord Jesus Christ as a positive and integral 
              part of Vaisnava theology, Srila Prabhupada was far ahead of his 
              time in his acceptance of other religions.</p>
            <p>Sacinandana Maharaja spoke about female aspects in Christian and 
              Vaisnava theology, noting how monotheistic religions had traditionally 
              portrayed God as a male entity. However, both Christian and Pagan 
              religions were now attempting to redefine the Divine spirit, with 
              witchcraft and fertility cults becoming more popular and prominent 
              in the West. There were even demands for the neutralisation of all 
              sexist expressions in the Bible.</p>
            <p>Sacinandana Swami then went on to describe the two forms of <i>devis</i> 
              (goddesses) in India, namely those who are dependent on and empowered 
              by <i>Bhagavan</i> (Krsna) and those who are independent of Him. 
              He cited two examples of the former. Firstly, Laksmidevi (Saktiman), 
              who is depicted as being smaller than Bhagavan in many temples and 
              portrayed as the Lord's wife (<i>svakiya-rasa</i>). Radharani has 
              greater independence, but is still strongly connected to Krsna (<i>parakiya-rasa</i>). 
              She is not married to the Lord and there is no consideration of 
              the moral code (<i>stri-dharma</i>); indeed, Her love (<i>prema</i>) 
              for Krsna is considered so strong that the Lord becomes dependant 
              on Her, and through this Radha assumes superiority over Krsna. The 
              Holi festival in India, where the ladies throw coloured powders 
              at the men, is an expression of these feelings of love. Devis independent 
              of Krsna include Sati Gaudavariya, Kali and Sakti. Sati gives women 
              strength to achieve the ideal platform of chastity. For example, 
              she enters into the body of a widow who has decided to give up her 
              life at her husband's funeral pyre.</p>
            <p>Sakti represents Krsna's energy, which is female by nature. Kali, 
              on the other hand, not only represents good qualities but also wrath, 
              a trait that has been completely negated in Christian theology. 
              Sacinandana Swami also cited a modern example of an independent 
              'goddess' (although a purely political invention) &#151; Mata Bharata, 
              or Mother India.</p>
            <p>Prof. Edmund Weber spoke about the definition of mercy and karma, 
              which he illustrated with examples from two different theological 
              sections in Vaisnavism which resemble the Protestant and Catholic 
              understanding of mercy. Protestant philosophy states that salvation 
              is independent of karma or qualification, believing that God's freedom 
              alone is the cause of His mercy. An example of this would be the 
              mother cat, who carries her kittens in her mouth, a process which 
              requires no effort on their behalf. On the other hand, Catholic 
              theology sees the individual soul as having a share in his/her own 
              salvation, a process which depends on the person's pious achievements 
              (karma), which is compared to baby monkeys who have to cling to 
              their mother if they wish to be carried by her.</p>
            <p>Thus, Protestant theology sees man as opposing salvation with God, 
              who is looking for means to give His mercy. Professor Weber mentioned 
              Namalva, a <i>sudra </i>poet, who allegedly lacked any prerequisite 
              (good<i> karma</i>) for salvation. Namalva claimed that he had never 
              allowed the Lord to enter his heart and never offered respect to 
              his guru. He was, in fact, a rebel against God, but was finally 
              overpowered by His mercy and became full of divine love. The Protestant 
              therefore sees God as giving His mercy to those He wants to, and 
              for no other reason. However, The Catholics counter that God does 
              not save people whimsically, and he is not above justice.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Martin Mittwede spoke about the problem of interpreting 
              religious terms from different theological traditions and within 
              varying contexts. In the discussion that followed, Professor Weber 
              pointed out that it is not the change of interpretation, but the 
              destruction of rituals, that threatens religion. Rituals, baptism 
              for example, do not have to be understood in order to be effective. 
              Sacinandana Swami added that in the <i>Vedas </i>it is said that 
              spiritual power works independently at five places &#151; the holy 
              name, the <i>sadhus</i>, <i>sastra</i>, sacred places and worship 
              on the altar.</p>
            <p>These meetings are seen as a valuable chance for ISKCON members 
              and scholars to exchange views. For devotees, it was very interesting 
              to see the similarities between Vaisnava and Christian theology. 
              In turn, the academic delegates appeared to appreciate the broad 
              non-sectarian approach of the Vaisnava representatives and recognised 
              universal patterns in the presentation of the female aspect of God, 
              which many progressive Christian theologians are now welcoming as 
              an enriched understanding of the Divine. Peter Schmidt's challenging 
              and thought-provoking statements will have prompted a great deal 
              of internal contemplation amongst the devotees present. </p>
            <p>Plans are already underway for the next seminar, which will discuss 
              Srila Prabhupada's views on Buddhism.</p>
