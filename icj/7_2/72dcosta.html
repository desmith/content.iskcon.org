            <p>I am honoured at being invited to respond to this important landmark 
              document. As a Roman Catholic concerned with interreligious relations 
              I welcome and admire this statement. It is simple, lucid, moving 
              and theologically convincing, and seems to make explicit much that 
              I have already experienced and respected in members of ISKCON.</p>
            <p>Historically, the statement is important for two particular reasons. 
              'Hinduism' is such a broad label encompassing a very complex phenomenon, 
              so that to have a statement that has been institutionally agreed 
              as representing one segment of this vast religious tradition is 
              quite a triumph. It can only be welcomed in helping to clarify some 
              of the issues involved in understanding Hinduism and interreligious 
              dialogue. Second, it is also important in indicating the sociological 
              significance of Gaudiya-Vaisnava Hinduism, in the West and internationally. 
              Saunaka Rsi Dasa says, in his introduction to the statement, that 
              it reflects a 'more global responsibility', and this is to be welcomed, 
              for the relation between religions is vital to the future of our 
              planet.</p>
            <p>What I found particularly commendable about the statement is the 
              clear theological underpinning of the views advanced. They come 
              in part 3, but are the rationale for parts 1 and 2, and lead very 
              naturally to part 4. Part 3, then, is the most important section 
              by which to judge the coherence and integrity of the rest of the 
              document. It provides a powerful rationale for the distinction between 
              'pure love of God, and what is commonly understood as religion' 
              (p. 4). This distinction thereby allows for a fundamental unity 
              of persons in their devotion to a personal deity, be they Christian, 
              Jewish, Hindu or Muslim. This authentic devotion is recognised 'by 
              the presence of any of the nine devotional processes outlined by 
              the Vaisnava authority, Prahlada Maharaja' (p. 5). In effect, the 
              document develops the ancient tradition to apply it to modern problems 
              and questions. The two most recommended processes of the nine are 
              hearing spiritual sound and chanting the name of God, but we are 
              not told of the other seven in this document.</p>
            <p> This is a failing, for it does not provide a rationale for the 
              affirmation given to those from non-theistic traditions and non-religious 
              traditions stated in the opening paragraph. (part 1, (1), p.1) This 
              also underscores the slight ambiguity present in the document: it 
              says it deals with those who have faith in a personal divinity (p. 
              1), and yet it then continuously deals with these further two categories 
              (nontheistic religions and humanism). I think it is important to 
              address non-theistic and non-religious movements, but then one has 
              to do this more carefully in the light of the Vaisnava tradition 
              and clarify the conceptual differences between theistic traditions 
              explicitly involved in devotion to God (which is the only linking 
              point provided in part 3) and those not involved in devotion to 
              a personal deity at all &#151; even if they are involved in good 
              works and seek to do follow the truth as they see it. For example, 
              nowhere in part 3 do we find a justification of why: 'Other communities 
              and organisations advocating humanitarian, ethical and moral standards 
              are also valued as being beneficial to society' (p. 1). From a Vaisnava 
              point of view, devotional relationship to God and cultivation of 
              God consciousness is the proper prerequisite to ethics and right 
              action. However, the document seems to overturn this element in 
              the tradition, and this requires more careful justification than 
              is given.</p>
            <p>The spirit of respect, dignity and openness pervades this document, 
              both in style and content. It clearly indicates that Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              Hinduism takes other (theistic) religions seriously and does not 
              dismiss them. It acknowledges that it has much to learn from them, 
              and, if they are willing to listen, much to offer. It indicates 
              that this willingness to learn does not in the least mitigate against 
              the missionary nature of Gaudiya-Vaisnava Hinduism. This makes the 
              document credible and indicates its clear roots and commitment as 
              well as its openness. In Part 2, however, mission seems to be exclusively 
              directed towards 'atheistic and materialistic' traditions (p. 2) 
              for they, apparently, are the most challenged by Gaudiya-Vaisnava 
              Hinduism. While this may be true, it seems to me that a more historical 
              orientation to the question might show that many (theistic) religions 
              have as bad, or worse, records than atheistic and materialist traditions. 
              The point is that if Gaudiya-Vaisnava Hinduism's mission is to challenge 
              the godlessness of society, it should not<i> </i>assume <i>a priori 
              </i>that godlessness is to be found outside of religions. What is 
              required is a more differentiated analysis of 'religions'. As an 
              aside, I should say that this is also a weakness in the major Roman 
              Catholic document on relations between religions (1965: <i>Nostra 
              Aetate</i>).</p>
            <p>I want to end with a question. Part 4 deals with principles and 
              guidelines. These are very attractive, realistic and helpful. There 
              is one point in both the principles and guidelines that do not make 
              sense to me in the light of Gaudiya-Vaisnava theology. 'Be prepared 
              to listen to others, to understand their language, assumptions, 
              culture and values. Therefore, do not judge others' practice by 
              our ideals' (p. 6, principle 7). 'Allow members of other faiths 
              to define themselves in their own language and own culture without 
              imposing definitions upon them, thus avoiding to compare their practice 
              with our ideals.' (p. 7, guideline 4). It is absolutely right to 
              try and understand the 'others' in their own terms, but it makes 
              no sense to then suspend a critical judgement especially if one 
              is a Gaudiya-Vaisnava Hindu (at least in my own reading!). In Part 
              3, it makes it clear that there are nine devotional processes that 
              measure the presence of true devotion, and this is therefore making 
              judgements about others on one's own criteria. Furthermore, there 
              are huge judgements made upon others based on Gaudiya Vaisnava principles 
              such as: the poverty of materialism and atheism; and that 'no one 
              religion holds a monopoly on the truth' (p. 2) &#151; presumably 
              even if they think they do. Why make these latter claims and then 
              in the last part of the document say that such claims should not 
              be made? It is important to be respectful and attentive to others, 
              but not at the cost of being attentive to the truth.</p>
            <p>These questions are raised out of respect and are, I hope, intra-systematic 
              questions. That is, they arise from the internal logic of the document 
              and are not posed from a specifically Roman Catholic point of view. 
              From a Roman Catholic point of view, I think the two main difficulties 
              with the document are first, the relativisation of 'religion' and 
              the historical process of 'true devotion' that seems to transcend 
              'religion'. In this respect, the questions have some analogy with 
              the debate between liberal Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. 
              Second, there is a commendation of love and devotion without specific 
              reference to the meaning of suffering and redeeming love, as found 
              in the cross of Christ. This would require a more differentiated 
              accounting of the meaning of 'love' and 'devotion'. In many respects 
              both 'difficulties' are matters that call for more serious dialogue 
              between Gaudiya-Vaisnava Hinduism and Christians &#151; which is 
              precisely what the document demands and, most importantly, facilitates. 
              For this, Christians should be most grateful.</p>
