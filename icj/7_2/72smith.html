            Publisher: SRI, Los Angeles<br>
            ISBN: 1-889756-30-X </span> 
            <p>Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda (1838-1914) was a prominent figure 
              among the Gaudiya Vaisnavas of Bengal. He wrote more than a hundred 
              works and was the father of Bimal Prasad Datta (Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati), guru of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, the founder of ISKCON. 
            </p>
            <p>First gaining employment as a teacher and then as a clerk, Kedarnath 
              Datta entered government service in 1866, and remained a magistrate 
              until 1894. Beyond his significance in the history of Vaisnavism, 
              his dual career is intriguing, and Dr Shukavak's  study sets out 
              the available information on both the magistrate and the theologian 
              with care and diligence. In brief, Bhaktivinoda's course is clear 
              cut, from Sakta family background, passion for English literature 
              and flirtation with Christianity in his youth, and then an ever-deepening 
              understanding of Gaudiya Vaisnavism. The stresses and strains of 
              the life of a theologian-magistrate can for the most part be only 
              guessed at, but Dr Shukavak finds new material, making use of a 
              long autobiographical letter by Bhaktivinoda. It is fascinating 
              to learn, e.g., that Bhaktivinoda's family had a dog called Tiger, 
              who accompanied them when they moved to Bihar.</p>
            <p>After an account of 'modernity' in nineteenth-century Calcutta 
              in the opening chapters, most of the book has to do with Bhaktivinoda's 
              contributions to Gaudiya Vaisnavism. Shukavak only mentions his 
              poetry in passing. Bhaktivinoda's English poem on Porus, the Indian 
              king defeated by Alexander, his <i>Vijana-grama </i>in Bengali of 
              the destruction by cholera of his native village, and his English 
              poem <i>Reflections</i>, all mentioned in the list of his works 
              (Appendix One of the book) might supply material to further round 
              out Shukavak's picture of Bhaktivinoda. Shukavak also mentions five 
              'semi-secular' works by a Kedarnath Datta, including a <i>British 
              Mahatmya Kavya</i>. He tells us that as a young man Bhaktivinoda 
              was reading Milton, Macaulay, Hazlit and Carlyle; and for a while 
              was under the spell of an American Unitarian Missionary. It is not 
              impossible for one or more of these works to have been written by 
              Bhaktivinoda before he settled down to his life's work as a Vaisnava.</p>
            <p>While referring to selected Bhaktivinoda's theological works from 
              all periods of his literary life, Dr Shukavak relies especially 
              on his <i>Sajjana-tosani</i>, his <i>Krsna-samhita</i>, and the 
              autobiographical letter. In 1892-3 there are numerous articles describing 
              Bhaktivinoda's preaching activities. In tune with modernity is the 
              use of the image of a market, with the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> and 
              related texts as the warehouses, the principal Gaudiya Vaisnavas 
              as traders, the people of the world as customers, and himself, Bhaktivinoda, 
              as the lowly sweeper whose job it was to keep the marketplace clean. 
              With great enterprise, Bhaktivinoda established over five hundred 
              <i>nama-hatta-sanga</i>s (associations) throughout Bengal. </p>
            <p>Shukavak tells us that the <i>Krsna-samhita</i>, published serially 
              in the <i>Sajjana-Tosani </i>in 1903, represents, more than any 
              other work 'the foundations of [Bhaktivinoda's] reconciliation of 
              tradition and modernity'. But this reconciliation goes no further 
              than the suggestion that caste should ideally be based on character 
              rather than birth; and the view that in the esoteric practice of 
              <i>siddha-pranali-diksa</i>, the candidate and guru should confer 
              together as to the appropriate <i>siddha-deha</i>, and that the 
              <i>siddha-deha </i>could later be modified if it didn't suit. Certainly, 
              this book is not the final word on Bhaktivinoda and modernity, but 
              it is a valuable contribution to the understanding of modern Hinduism 
              and is to be warmly welcomed.</p>
