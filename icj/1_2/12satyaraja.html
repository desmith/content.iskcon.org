            <h2 align=left class="maintextsubhead">A Conversation Between Satyaraja 
              Dasa <br>
              and Dr E. Burke Rochford, Jr.</h2>
            <h4 align=CENTER>&nbsp; </h4>
            <p><i> The following conversation took place in January, 1992.</i> 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa</b> : Lord Caitanya predicted a Golden 
              Age for the next ten thousand years. ISKCON and Prabhupada's books, 
              specifically, are to survive, even thrive, for that period. But 
              then the Kali age really sets in, and intense degradation becomes 
              more and more prominent. In the interim period, however, devotees 
              are convinced that ISKCON will flourish. But in exactly what form? 
              This is open to question. So, first of all, how do you feel about 
              this notion of ISKCON flourishing or abiding? Do you think it will? 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> We must acknowledge that the movement 
              will exist - it has staying power. That's for certain. I think the 
              bigger questions involve the form, because the movement has already 
              gone through several serious transition periods. But the movement 
              has definitely shown that it's here to stay. There's a nice segment 
              by sociologist Rosabeth Kanter who, in her book <i> Commitment and 
              Community,</i> talks about communes in the nineteenth century. She 
              looks at ninety-one such movements who've left historical records, 
              and it's interesting because less than a dozen were able to survive 
              twenty-five years, or a single generation. And the majority lasted 
              less than four years. So, one thing we have to understand, as a 
              starting point, is that this movement has lasted well beyond the 
              average life expectancy of such organisations. It has without a 
              doubt shown its ability to endure. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa</b>: Well, then, let's begin like 
              this: just why has ISKCON endured? To what would you attribute its 
              longevity? </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford: </b>I think we can point to a couple 
              of things. First of all, I think we can look at its strong, deep 
              religious tradition - its roots in the Gaudiya Vaisnava heritage. 
              Then we can also look at the ways in which that tradition has been 
              passed on over the course of time such that those who take it up 
              are transformed, or altered, in terms of consciousness - the richness 
              of its theology and practice. These are formidable considerations. 
            </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In fact, of those nineteenth-century communes that 
              Kanter had investigated, the majority of those that had endured 
              were religious. So, wherever you see this sort of all-encompassing 
              ideology, especially where there is a societal plan with a deep 
              theological background, you see the prospects for success being 
              that much greater. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa</b>: I guess there are many reasons 
              for this, the foremost being spiritual. But I think that from a 
              strictly sociological point of view, it might be said that such 
              communities are more likely to be successful because they unify 
              people around a common goal. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Exactly. It presents a sense of 
              common purpose for people. Also, relating it to the 'spiritual' 
              reasons you were alluding to - and this is especially the case with 
              ISKCON - people have experienced advancement in their pursuit of 
              God. In other words, the movement gives what is promises. It's that 
              simple, really. There's little question as to whether the practice 
              of Krsna consciousness works - you've got people who have been devotees 
              for over twenty years. They're getting something from this. You've 
              got centuries of Gaudiya Vaisnavas in India - and tens of thousands 
              (if not millions) today - who also have adhered to the process of 
              Krsna consciousness and derived spiritual satisfaction. So this 
              cannot be ignored. The primary reason for an enduring community 
              is time-tested proof that the goals of that community are attainable 
              and valuable. ISKCON has shown this beyond any questionable doubt, 
              at least for an informed observer. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Let's return for a moment to 
              Kanter's study. Of the few communal groups who had staying power, 
              how many went through radical transformations? I mean, longevity 
              is important, but if a given group, especially a religious group, 
              departs from its initial goals ... . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Most of them did undergo change. 
              And these are far-reaching. Some movements remained true to their 
              traditional form. Others have become transformed in the sense that 
              they've taken on a sort of accommodationist stance in regard to 
              the world, or the larger society. But they, too, remain true to 
              their religious principles and vows in some manner. And then there 
              are other religious groups that went through tremendous transformations, 
              becoming big business enterprises and worldly concerns - a total 
              transformation. Such groups often retain some semblance of their 
              religious elements, but as a secondary concern. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa: </b>Do you think, perhaps, at one 
              time the danger was that such a fate could have befallen ISKCON? 
              In the mid seventies, when the movement was more financially stable, 
              we could just as easily become another big business, wouldn't you 
              say? </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Some say it could have happened. 
              But I don't think so. And history has shown that it didn't happen. 
              I think the primary reason for this is the fact that ISKCON money 
              was always going into the printing of religious books, the distribution 
              of sacred food, temples, and things of this nature. The money from 
              the <i>sankirtan</i> was not used, at least not for the most part, 
              in making a comfortable, material life for people. It went directly 
              back into the religious concerns. So this is an important factor. 
            </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In one sense, though, this is all ancient history, 
              although economics is still a critical factor for the movement. 
              In fact, it may be more important now than ever before. ISKCON, 
              at this point, doesn't really have a stable, viable economic infrastructure. 
              This distinguishes it from similar communities, and it should be 
              a critical concern. It can affect the form the movement takes in 
              the years ahead. Householders, for instance, are finding, more and 
              more, that they have to go out and get jobs or set up private businesses. 
              This is now accepted, by and large, by the community of devotees. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT>Working outside, of course, was also accepted ten or 
              twelve years ago, but it was the exception rather than the rule. 
              Such things would have more generally been perceived as <i>maya</i>, 
              or 'illusion', with only very rare exceptions. Now, I think this 
              accommodationist view is a sign that the movement is developing 
              in a healthy way, but there are dangers too. And this is clearly 
              the problem that is perceived by 'the purists', if you will. They 
              don't want to compromise the tradition, which is valid. So, there's 
              a tension developing, and we'll have to see the way in which devotees 
              deal with this. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>These developments, by the way, present a potentially 
              dramatic effect on the movement in terms of what its course is going 
              to be. It's bringing devotees into the outside world in a rather 
              full way - they have to work side-by-side with people who do not 
              share their beliefs and sense of commitment. So that can have its 
              effect. But on the other side, devotees can now preach to people 
              with whom they wouldn't have ordinarily come into contact, and in 
              a profound way. Not only with words, but with an example of how 
              to be Krsna conscious in what these people consider to be 'the real 
              world'. This is important: if the only example ISKCON can set is 
              that of cloistered monks, you're going to lose a whole segment of 
              society that could otherwise seriously respond to what you have 
              to say. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>You know, taken within the context of earlier Vedic 
              tradition, this could all be seen as the unfolding of the v<i>arnashrama</i> 
              system. Initially, Prabhupada wanted to create <i>brahmanas</i>, 
              an intellectual class, to guide society and, clearly, a lot of the 
              early devotees did see themselves in this way, even if many of them 
              lacked the necessary qualifications. Then, again, many <i>were</i> 
              qualified, and have shown it over the years. The point I want to 
              make, though, is that this was a natural place for Prabhupada to 
              start: his first and foremost concern was to create a society that 
              had God in the centre. This necessitated the making of <i>brahmanas 
              - </i>people who see spirituality as the most prominent part of 
              their lives. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>In Prabhupada's wisdom, he emphasised this as the paramount 
              thing, knowing that once he had a class of <i>brahmanas </i> the 
              movement would be established on a strong foundation, and the other 
              classes would grow out of that. Therefore he intimated that fifty 
              per cent of his work was left undone - the natural unfolding of 
              the <i> varnashrama </i>system. And as time goes on, <i>varnashrama</i> 
              organically unfolds. In fact, we see that some devotees are performing 
              <i>brahminical </i>work, but others are going out and finding work 
              that suits them most. You have lawyers, farmers, businessmen - the 
              whole nine yards. This diversity can create a stable economic and 
              social base for ISKCON. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>In fact, ISKCON requires this if it is to become what 
              sociologists call 'institutionally complete'. Anyway, diversity 
              of employment or occupation is a step in this direction, even if 
              it's not necessarily the <i>varnashrama</i> system proper. Actually, 
              it's a facsimile of <i>varnashrama</i> that is just beginning to 
              rear its head in ISKCON. I wonder, as the movement grows and learns 
              to accommodate this, will it turn into the actual <i>varnashrama 
              </i> ideal that we've read so much about? So it opens new doors 
              . . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> But many devotees will naturally 
              find themselves going in this direction as they mature both physically 
              and spiritually, and so they should be ready for this and know how 
              to deal with it. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford: </b>Definitely. Now that the boundary 
              between ISKCON and the outside world is more flexible and fluid, 
              there's potential to really grow. The old idea that 'you're a monk 
              or you're in <i>maya</i>' has more or less seen its day. Devotees 
              are assimilating, or maturing, as you say. And it's interesting 
              to look at the factors that were instrumental in this. First, you 
              have a decline in book distribution and the selling of paraphernalia; 
              you have devotees growing older and developing the need to take 
              care of their families. Again, the economic factor. Devotees were 
              left without alternatives. When books and incense were on the decline 
              .. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b> Satyaraja Dasa:</b> I think this had a lot to do 
              with the time. In the late sixties and early seventies, exotic Indian 
              religion, incense, and things of this nature, were in vogue. As 
              the seventies came to an end, so did the popularity of many of these 
              items, things associated with Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Right. And then you had the anti-cult 
              movement, which really gained ground in the late seventies. That 
              really affected <i>sankirtana </i>- especially in America (maybe 
              only America!). .People became suspicious of the devotees and all 
              so-called cults. So a new economic base was needed for a variety 
              of reasons. And many devotees, out of necessity, took to working 
              in the outside world. Now, it can be said that some of these devotees 
              are not strict practitioners, but I don't think that this is a fair 
              appraisal. Of course, some of them are not strict but, then again, 
              some of those who continue to live inside the temple are not strict. 
              It is very much an individual thing. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>You know, I visited one temple recently for a<i> mangal 
              aratik</i> service at 4.14 a.m., and I witnessed what I'm sure was 
              a minority representation of the community of devotees - and I suspect 
              this is true in most North American temples. Now, what does this 
              mean? Well, the purists would say that the people who don't attend 
              all of the services are in <i>maya</i>, but I think it runs a little 
              deeper than that. Many purists may not have a nine-to-five job. 
              Or they may not have a family to raise. To be involved in one's 
              family, in the way that is required, is no easy task. It takes a 
              lot of time and energy. But if one takes on that responsibility, 
              he has to do it correctly. So this has to be considered. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>A sincere devotee will naturally have some modicum of 
              an early morning service, simulating what goes on in the temple 
              or actually attending part of the temple functions. But it is unrealistic 
              to expect that a householder, living outside, with tons of responsibilities, 
              should have the same requirements that a monk inside will have. 
              Of course, at this point, devotees will run to their <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              and show a million 'Prabhupada saids'. But the plain fact is that 
              the movement is evolving, and Prabhupada clearly expected this. 
              It evolved constantly while he was here, and it continues to evolve 
              in his physical absence. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The economic needs of the devotees, and their requirements 
              as people, as we've shown, are clearly different than they were 
              in the days when Prabhupada was here, and the purists have to accept 
              this. You see, the purists and the accommodationists can either 
              benefit from, or suffocate, each other. It's up to them. With the 
              cautions exerted by the purists, the accommodationists can spread 
              Krsna consciousness into the world. And with the financial, preaching, 
              festivities, and sheer numbers support of the accomodationists, 
              the core members of the institution can carry on their grassroots 
              activities. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> I see that. It's going on already, 
              to some degree. This is definitely the direction we're heading in. 
              We say, 'Prabhupada built a house in which the whole world could 
              live'. And we're working to realise that goal. But there are problems. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Yes. But without labouring the finer 
              points of the issue, I think the problems can be solved rather simply. 
              If devotees both inside and outside the temple learn to communicate 
              more, and to have mutual respect, Prabhupada's vision could be achieved. 
              Of course, this is more difficult than it seems. Nonetheless, the 
              importance of devotee relationships cannot be overstated. And, if 
              I'm not mistaken, this is now a much vocalised point among the reformers 
              in the movement. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> That's right. But this is related 
              to older, long-standing problems. I'm talking about the rift between 
              ascetics and householders. In fact, the tension between monks and 
              married people is an old one. It existed in India for some time, 
              and was even seen in the Gaudiya Matha (ISKCON's parent institution). 
              But, despite this tension Gaudiya Vaishnavism, from the time of 
              Mahaprabhu to the present day, has accommodated householders. To 
              start the movement in theWest, Prabhupada emphasised monastic life. 
              Of course, I'm not saying that this emphasis would have necessarily 
              shifted but as devotees matured, and began to work and raise families, 
              I think he would have structured the organisation to accommodate 
              these things in a more grassroots kind of way. Emphasis on in-house 
              businesses, <i>gurukula</i>, and these kinds of things. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>If you look at the history of our <i>sampradaya</i>, 
              there has always been a large contingent of householders, even among 
              the greatest devotees. Bhaktivinoda Thakura, a great teacher in 
              our line, was the father of ten children, a court magistrate, and 
              a prolific writer. Now, his lifestyle was quite different than the 
            </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY> monks of his time, but he was also a respected devotee 
              - a devotee of the highest order. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>I see it as a question of maturity. Mature purists, 
              to use your term, will embrace householders - trying to understand 
              their different lifestyle - and work with them to spread Krsna consciousness. 
              And mature householders, who largely fit into what you call the 
              accommodationist category, will work with the monks and do their 
              level best to come up to standard. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> This is required if the movement 
              is to survive. Well, it will survive in any case. But this is required 
              if the movement is to prosper. And look at the example you mentioned 
              - Bhaktivinoda. His co-workers would have seen in him an upright, 
              honest, ethical citizen, who is contributing to the world both materially 
              and spiritually. Clearly, not everyone will contribute in this all-consuming 
              way. But his example is significant. Such a class of devotees, in 
              some sense at least, offers an even better example than their renunciant 
              counterparts. They are clearly in the world, but not of it. This 
              impresses people, at times on a much deeper level. It's something 
              they can relate to, and it makes Krsna consciousness appear practical, 
              something that has value for them in their present state. And something 
              that's accessible. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>I think one thing that needs to be discussed is the 
              subject of role models, both for purists and accommodationists. 
              Again, you mentioned Bhaktivinoda - a perfect role model, in a sense, 
              for both. And then there's certainly Srila Prabhupada. But the onus 
              now falls squarely on the shoulders of Prabhupada`s disciples. Good 
              leadership is called for . . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Let me read you something that 
              was written by a sociologist named Stuart Wright: 'Commitment to 
              a movement characterised by charismatic leadership emerges out of 
              an investment of &quot;trust&quot; made by members . One problem 
              all world-transforming movements face is that followers need to 
              be convinced that movement leaders are legitimate embodiments or 
              representatives of moral truths and, therefore, worthy of their 
              sacrifice and dedication. If, however, invested loyalty or trust 
              is betrayed through actions that are perceived as morally inconsistent 
              with espoused ideals or goals, the likelihood of defection is increased.' 
            </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This interests me and dictates, perhaps, the next 
              course of our discussion. ISKCON thrived under Prabhupada's guidance 
              and personal example. Soon after his departure, things started to 
              get difficult, to say the least. It seems that the onus really is 
              on the current leaders of ISKCON to set high examples . . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> It has to be there in any movement, 
              and doubly in this one, if for no other reason than the overwhelming 
              centrality of the guru/disciple relationship. So all senior devotees 
              have an obligation to set a high standard, but this obligation is 
              especially poignant for those who are set up as gurus - they must 
              embody the ideals, or else people will simply leave the movement. 
            </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>There is, of course, the phenomenon of seeing Krsna 
              consciousness as larger than the institution and even larger than 
              the relationship with one's own guru. In that case devotees who 
              have problem-gurus, shall we say, will stay within the fold of Krsna 
              consciousness. They will go on with their practices and take recourse 
              in Prabhupada and his teachings, eventually taking shelter, perhaps, 
              of one of Prabhupada`s more exemplary disciples. But such things 
              are rare, and the more common case scenario is that a disenchanted 
              disciple will simply leave the movement to pursue a more materialistic 
              life. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In ISKCON today, though, there is a sense of connection 
              with Srila Prabhupada and, through him, the whole Gaudiya tradition. 
              So disenchanted devotees would do well to nurture this relationship 
              in addition to the relationship with his or her individual guru, 
              or through his or her guru. That way, if there is some betrayal 
              of trust - if the guru falls away from the movement - the disciple 
              still has Prabhupada and the entire process of Krsna consciousness. 
              Do you agree? </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Absolutely. Traditionally, this 
              is called <i>acharya-purusha</i> - everyone is linked to the pure 
              representative of Krsna. In our case, Prabhupada is the founder/<i> 
              acharya </i>of ISKCON - so everyone in the institution should have 
              a direct relationship with him. This is not to say that one is not 
              linked through one's guru, or that one does not honour one's guru, 
              but the <i>acharya </i> is of central importance to everyone in 
              the institution. The relationship with one's guru is dependent upon 
              the guru's relationship with Prabhupada. This is <i>parampara</i>. 
              In this way there is a common interest of all disciples and, as 
              we've discussed, this enables an institution to grow and prosper. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> This is the point. I know there's 
              some controversy about <i>ritvik</i> and <i>diksha</i>, and things 
              of that sort. That's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking 
              about a very pragmatic connection. It's real. No matter who one's 
              initiating guru is, an ISKCON devotee is distinctly related to Prabhupada 
              - a Prabhupada follower. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> We call it Prabhupad-<i>anuga</i>! 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Right. And while we're talking about 
              the importance of leadership, I want to say that I think there is 
              some trouble in ISKCON today. Leaders are not what they once were. 
              Maybe it's because they are feeling Prabhupada`s absence, I don't 
              know. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Well, it really varies. There's 
              strong leadership in Europe. Harikesa Maharaja . . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Oh, I'm generalising, without doubt. 
              I'm speaking mainly about the movement in America. That was subject 
              of my dissertation and the area in which I've conducted the most 
              elaborate amount of research. But, no, I'm aware of the success, 
              especially in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It's phenomenal. 
              Since Prabhupada's departure, the movement has tripled in those 
              places. And it continues to grow in South America, too. But there 
              is clearly a problem in America. The devotees there, by and large, 
              are not as inspired as they once were. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>There are a lot of reasons for this. One reason may 
              simply be a reflection of age. Devotees are older, with families, 
              and their concerns are shifting. In some ways, their commitment 
              to Krsna consciousness may be deeper than ever before. But externally, 
              they don't appear to have the zealousness of bygone days. Their 
              time is spent with the family or at work. We've discussed this already. 
              Even the people who are joining the movement today, though, do not 
              seem to have the same spirit as the devotees I met when I first 
              came around, some fifteen years ago. A lot of young people today 
              have hardly even heard of the movement, much less desire to join 
              it. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Well, there is the straight-edge 
              phenomenon, you know. I was discussing this with J. Stillson Judah 
              several months ago. He asked me about the young people today and 
              if they still join for the same reasons as when I joined the movement, 
              almost twenty years ago. I told him that the kids of today are very 
              different, and I had these straight-edge kids in mind. They join 
              the movement because it gives theological legitimisation to practices 
              they already hold dear. For example, straight-edge kids are mostly 
              celibate, they avoid intoxication, and they are determined vegetarians. 
              Naturally, Krsna consciousness is appealing to them. They're already 
              in the mode of goodness, and so they're attracted to the lifestyle 
              of the devotees. Not surprisingly, more and more of these kids are 
              joining the movement. So I'm not sure if I'd agree with you .. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> No, I'm not saying that. There's 
              a good clientele out there. But I don't think the devotees are responding 
              as quickly as they should. Or, at least, they're not responding 
              as quickly as they would have, say ten or twelve years ago. This 
              is definitely the case in America. You know, I used to be able to 
              ask my students, an entire class, 'How many of you have had a face-to-face 
              encounter with a Hare Krsna?' Practically all hands would rise - 
              every student had a story to tell. Over the years, however, this 
              has happened less and less, and now few have had direct contact 
              with the devotees. So there's a problem with the movement in America, 
              and, in my estimation, a lot of it can be traced to poor leadership. 
              Book distribution is down, <i>harinama</i> is down. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Now, part of this is to do with the economic situation, 
              age, leadership etc., as already discussed, but there are other 
              factors as well. Some devotees say that things started going downhill 
              once Prabhupada departed. But, if truth be told, book distribution 
              and other things started to decline a couple of years prior to that. 
              And I think the end of the sixties and early seventies - with its 
              hippiedom, exotic Indian religion, incense, etc., was one of the 
              factors. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>Still, things started to deteriorate even before Prabhupada 
              left. It's interesting, isn't it? The days of annually doubling 
              book distribution scores and the millions of books sold started 
              to taper off by 1976. It wasn't as bad as it was to become in the 
              eighties, but there was a clear decline. And so devotees started 
              to go out on <i>sankirtana</i> as Santa Claus and distribute records 
              and paraphernalia even while Prabhupada was still here! So these 
              were the beginnings of the economic difficulties for ISKCON. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Of course, instead of solving 
              the problems these things exacerbated the situation, and devotees 
              were perceived as entrepreneurs - just out to make a buck. Even 
              for the devotees who were honest and relatively straightforward, 
              it started to look bad. 'Devotees as Santa Claus? Just see how deceptive 
              these </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>devotees are!' But the Santa Claus thing started 
              in good spirit, using the holiday season to distribute the message 
              of God. And Prabhupada supported it! Unfortunately, it was eventually 
              abused by opportunistic devotees, and so the suspicions of already 
              sceptical non-devotees seemed justified. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Exactly. In a sense, it couldn't 
              have been worse. The short-term gain was not worth the long-term 
              consequences. I don't think there's any question about this. And 
              these things developed independently of Srila Prabhupada's disappearance. 
              Whether he was here or not, these things were going on. And then 
              with the anti-cult movement and the Robin George Case, the defection 
              of New Vrndavana, bad or bogus gurus, bad or bogus media - Americans, 
              by and large, came to mistrust the devotees. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The anti-cult movement became a viable force in America, 
              especially in the mid-to-late seventies. That's when they were at 
              their strongest, which means that they were spreading their own 
              propaganda about ISKCON and other new religious movements. So they 
              were, in a sense, shaping public opinion. The press obviously helped 
              them along the way. As a result, people were already gaining a sense 
              of distrust and even began to think that the movement was dangerous 
              in some way. This was going on while Prabhupada was here. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>The other thing we have to look at is the devotees themselves. 
              In some cases, you had inexperienced, if well-meaning, devotees, 
              who acted like anything but Vaisnavas while out on <i>sankirtana</i>. 
              This is not to say, of course, that there weren't many sincere devotees 
              out there - and still are - who were doing it properly with compassion 
              and the correct religious attitude. But let's face it, there were 
              many overzealous devotees who were just trying to rake in the bucks. 
              Some did it 'to please Prabhupada'; others did it for name and glory; 
              still others, I'm sure, did it for their own profitable ends. But 
              it created a bad name for the movement. A growing public hostility 
              was taking place - an unfortunate hostility. So there are a lot 
              of factors that are working together to make things difficult for 
              the devotees here in the States. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Hopefully, American devotees have learned their lessons 
              well and will not make the same mistakes. They can learn from their 
              past and from the Indian community as well. Here's a prime example 
              of how to pursue Krsna consciousness in a tangible but sophisticated 
              way. I think the example of the Indian people is significant and 
              fits very neatly with the paradigm we've set up of accommodationist 
              devotees. But this is a touchy subject. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> How so? </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Well for starters, I don't think 
              there's any doubt that the East-Indian people will continue to have 
              a significant role in the movement. Now, there are many sides to 
              this issue. I think initially at least, Indians were brought in 
              more as a strategic consideration than anything else. With the anti-cult 
              movement labelling ISKCON 'a cult', something had to be done. The 
              logical and most natural move at this point was to affirm the long-standing 
              assumption that ISKCON was part of the Hindu heritage. Thus, it's 
              not a cult by the prevalent definition. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>The fact is, however, that ISKCON sees itself as <i>sanatana 
              dharma</i> and it sees Hinduism as a sectarian religion, possibly 
              having its origins in <i>sanatana dharma</i> but nonetheless a separate 
              phenomenon. Leaving all these technicalities aside for a moment, 
              one fact remains: ISKCON doesn't really see itself as Hindu and 
              so many see this identification as little more than a strategic 
              move. However, there's enough historical and ideological evidence 
              to associate ISKCON with Hinduism and so the identification can 
              wash with the legal system: ISKCON is part of Hinduism. Fine. It 
              has a neat label. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>But what happened is interesting. As more Indians 
              started to identify the ISKCON temples as their own, both they and 
              the devotees started to see that the two groups could benefit from 
              each other. </p>
            <p

                             align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> In fact, this was 
              one of Srila Prabhupada's plans. He wanted to popularise Krsna consciousness 
              in the West because people in other parts of the world generally 
              try to emulate the things they see going on here. He thought that 
              Indians would get more serious about Vaisnava <i>dharma</i> if they 
              saw Westerners taking it seriously. Which is exactly what happened. 
            </p>
            <p>Jack Hawley, a professor of religion at Columbia, calls it 'the 
              pizza effect'. Most people assume that pizza originated in Italy. 
              It didn't - it originated in America. But now it's popular in Italy 
              as well. So ISKCON, as a distinct institution, originated in the 
              States - but it had a huge effect in making India and Indians Krsna 
              conscious. </p>
            <p>Of course Prabhupada wanted East-Indian involvement, and as early 
              as 1970 he created the Life Membership programme. But he wanted 
              it to be clear that we were not teaching Hinduism, at least as it's 
              presently understood. We were not supporters of polytheism or the 
              caste system nor were we, in an ultimate sense, to be identified 
              with any sectarian religion. But Hindus were like our close relatives 
              ... . </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b> Dr Rochford: </b>Right. Anyway, the alliance between 
              the devotees and the Indian community initially gained strength 
              as a result of the efforts of the anti-cult movement. So this sort 
              of came in through the back door, if you will. But it's an important 
              merger of interests. The Indians came to the devotees' rescue: 'Oh, 
              when you attack ISKCON, you're attacking Hinduism'. And the devotees, 
              for their part, established Vaisnava temples and explained Vedic 
              texts and culture with renewed enthusiasm. So they helped each other. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Another way in which East-Indians 
              help ISKCON is related to our initial conversation about the growth 
              of ISKCON and its accommodationist direction. Most Indians who consider 
              Krsna consciousness their religion live outside the temple, have 
              jobs, family. So they provide an example of how to pursue Krsna 
              consciousness in the world which, as we've said, is becoming more 
              and more a part of the ISKCON lifestyle. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Precisely. East-Indians have indeed 
              traditionally supported ISKCON with funds -that's the life membership 
              programme. But why they were able to do so? Because they have jobs 
              and things of this nature. So they provide an essential model for 
              ISKCON devotees, especially since ISKCON is naturally growing in 
              the ways we've mentioned. If ISKCON devotees - and by this I especially 
              mean the householders - follow the lead of many of the well-established 
              Indian members it can decrease, if not put to an end, ISKCON's economic 
              problems. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This is not just for householders, but for all those 
              who want to keep jobs or make financial contributions. As you know, 
              the Indian community is becoming more and more involved as full-time 
              practitioners, advisers and managers of the movement so they will 
              naturally be a tremendous resource for ISKCON's future needs. I 
              think they're also being accepted more in the devotee community. 
              It seemed to me, some fifteen years ago, that devotees shunned the 
              Hindu world. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Well, I think the problem stemmed 
              from this: most Hindus did not want a twenty-year-old American telling 
              them about something they deemed to be their own religion. In other 
              words: 'Who are you to be telling me about an Indian religion? I 
              come from India'. But over the course of time, I think the Hindus 
              began to see that devotees did know more about the tradition (they 
              learned Sanskrit and Bengali) or, at the very least, they seemed 
              more committed to it and won Hindu acceptance because of that. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>On the other side, I think devotees were humbled 
              by having to align themselves with Hindus due to the anti-cult antagonism, 
              and also because of the economic problem - here were people who 
              knew how to make money and use it in Krsna's service. So devotees 
              came to respect Hindus and the experience they had to offer. </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Nicely put. But let's consider a 
              potential problem. As East-Indians become more involved in ISKCON, 
              what is the danger that Prabhupada's movement might become another 
              ethnic church? Of course, it is more likely they will be accepted 
              into ISKCON like everybody else, and because they accept the principles 
              and teachings expressed in Prabhupada`s books they will not fall 
              into the ethnic pitfall that so many religions have. 'You're not 
              that body' is, of course a simple straightforward teaching of ISKCON. 
              So, although the danger is there, I would trust that it's not likely. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> I don't think it's likely to 
              be a problem. The leadership of the movement is very cautious about 
              this, and anyone who makes it into ISKCON management knows the philosophy 
              well enough to avoid such pitfalls. Anyway, only time will tell. 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Indeed, that's true. Still, a lot 
              depends on devotee interaction and the way in which they deal with 
              the Indian community in the next few years. It should be an enlightening 
              experience for all concerned. Actually, the involvement of the Indian 
              community is something that will occur quite naturally. Perhaps 
              a more immediate thing to deal with, however, is the ongoing tension 
              between purist and accommodationist factions in ISKCON. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>There are definite ways that devotees can deal with 
              this, as we have discussed. Yet there are also ways that a fanatical 
              purist view could be detrimental, and I think ISKCON history has 
              shown that. </p>
            <p

                             align=LEFT><b>Satyaraja Dasa:</b> Can you give some 
              examples of things devotees should watch out for as the accommodationist 
              view becomes more and more prevalent? </p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Dr Rochford:</b> Well, to give some very brief examples: 
              if devotees assimilate too well they will, in a sense, minimise 
              the urgency of establishing the <i>varnashrama</i> system. There 
              will be virtually no need for it, at least as a formal institution. 
              If devotees take advantage of the already existing infrastructure 
              of the material world, in terms of work etc., they will not find 
              the need to establish modes of employment within the confines of 
              the movement, which will remain a small, economically inefficient 
              society. So that's one potential problem. Related to this is the 
              problem of <i>gurukula</i>. If devotees make use of outside schools, 
              they will never feel the urgency to develop the <i>gurukula </i>system. 
              So these are the types of problems. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Now, I'm not saying that these are necessarily bad 
              things. Perhaps it is in this way that economic and educational 
              facilities will unfold for ISKCON. No one really knows at this point. 
              But these things have to be thought about and openly discussed. 
              Should devotee children be educated outside? Maybe - ISKCON doesn't 
              have the same resources as outside institutions. The children can 
              perhaps be educated outside but given their spiritual education 
              in the home. Even so, there are critically important trade-offs 
              involved. And these may put ISKCON's young, and ISKCON itself, at 
              risk. </p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Nor are there vast numbers of job opportunities within 
              ISKCON. Devotees are learning to make use of the larger 'outside' 
              institutions, and perhaps this will lead to compromise - or maybe 
              it will simply lead to increased preaching opportunities. Maybe 
              devotees will work outside of ISKCON but their dedication to ISKCON 
              will not diminish in the slightest. That's certainly possible. But 
              the purists will not accept it and they will see this as undermining 
              the values of the institution. So, how to balance these things? 
            </p>
            <p align=LEFT>The movement needs to recognise that both these points 
              of view are valid and have a place in Krsna consciousness. What's 
              more, they are not isolated but represent a continuum - these are 
              grey areas in which every devotee will find himself from time to 
              time. It's not that one devotee is a purist and another is accommodationist. 
              Not at all. Every devotee periodically drifts from one of these 
              worldviews into the other. The future of ISKCON rests on exactly 
              how the institution, as a whole, finds a balance.</p>
