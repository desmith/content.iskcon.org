              H. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami</a> </h2>
            <p align=LEFT><i>In the final instalment of Srila Satsvarupa Goswami's 
              study of the spiritual needs and concerns of an ISKCON preacher, 
              he addresses the most fundamental aspect of every devotee's life- 
              sadhana. </i> 
            <p align=LEFT>I once asked Srila Prabhupada how a devotee could preach 
              the ideals of Krsna consciousness if he had not yet perfected himself. 
              'If someone asks me if he can go back to Godhead in one life, I 
              would say yes, but if he asked me if I were going back to Godhead 
              I don't know if I could definitely say yes.' Prahpuada replied. 
              'No, it is not a question of you go or I go, but if anyone takes 
              to Krsna consciousness, he will go back to Godhead. Krsna says. 
              Of course, if we are preaching it is not that we are exporting them 
              by consignment and we are not going,' He laughed. 'It is expected 
              that the preacher is going also. Just like with our books, our students 
              are very expert at selling them, but not at reading them. That is 
              not very good. They should read the books also.' 
            <p align=LEFT>Our own imperfection is not the main topic in our preaching. 
              We preach on the basis of the scriptures and the previous <i>acaryas</i>. 
              We preach by describing the process of Krsna consciousness, even 
              if we ourselves are not at the highest standards. But Prabhupada 
              always emphasised that the preacher should practise what he preaches, 
              and Lord Caitanya himself said, 'Become perfect and then preach.' 
              The actual Sanskrit (<i>apani acari bhakti karila pracara</i>) is 
              translated in <i>Adi-lila</i> 4.41 as, 'One's behaviour must be 
              exactly in accord with one's preaching.' Lord Caitanya asked the 
              <i> Sanodiya brahmana</i>: 'Therefore, how do we become perfect 
              before we preach?' 
            <p align=LEFT>We have to at least be strictly following the four basic 
              principles of Krsna consciousness - no illicit sex, no intoxication, 
              no meat-eating and no gambling. And we have to be chanting our minimum 
              quota of sixteen rounds of the <i>maha mantra</i>. If we are not 
              at that standard, it would be hypocritical for us to preach. Prabhupada 
              said, 'If you smoke cigarettes, you cannot tell others not to smoke.' 
              Following the basic vows of initiation can be considered a type 
              of Krsna conscious perfection. A preacher should also mention at 
              least once that he has not perfected that which he is speaking about. 
              This admission helps both the speaker and the listener to find a 
              common, honest ground. 
            <p align=LEFT>Several years ago, Jayadvaita Swami gave a talk on how 
              to solve ISKCON's problems by applying the four 'Rs': recognition, 
              remorse, rectification and reunion. These steps can also be used 
              for improving individual <i>sadhana</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>First, one must recognise that his spiritual life needs 
              to improve. Devotees in ISKCON sometimes fall victim to a myth of 
              good <i>japa</i>. 'I chanted good <i>japa</i> today.' By that, they 
              mean that they did not fall asleep. If this is considered good <i>japa</i>, 
              then there are many more universes to go in hearing and chanting. 
              The <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> says that after chanting Hare Krsna, 
              if tears don't come to the eyes, then the heart must be steel-framed. 
              It must be recognised then, that this condition is due to committing 
              offences in chanting. 
            <p align=LEFT>Next, we must feel remorse. It is not possible to skip 
              over remorse to rectification. Wanting to improve <i>sadhana </i>is 
              more than just an external business. The genuine feeling of remorse 
              for the present condition must be there. Sometimes the mood of repentance 
              may seem to be a foreign, medieval Christian concept - guilt for 
              sins. We may think that guilt should be entirely removed. No-one 
              likes to feel guilty or remorseful about something in their lives. 
              But we shouldn't confuse the issue. There is such a thing as too 
              much guilt or excessive mortification, but the <i>Vaisnava siddhanta</i> 
              teaches deep remorse in the spiritual sense. 
            <p
                             align=JUSTIFY>After Ajamila is saved at the time 
              of death by the Visnudutas, he felt deep regret for his sins. Prabhupada 
              comments in the purport: 'Not only should one give up his past habits, 
              but he must always regret his past sinful acts. This is the standard 
              of pure devotion.' 
            <p align=LEFT>It is a fact that all the drugs and illicit sex we engaged 
              in still affect us in a subtle way. We should regret these past 
              actions but still feel confident that our karma has been removed. 
              <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 3.31.13 describes Krsna as unlimited and 
              as perceived by a repentant heart. In his purport, Prabhupada says: 
              'Krsna is in everyone's heart but he can be realised only by a soul 
              who is repentant.' The basis of repentance is that we have forgotten 
              our constitutional position and want to become one with the Supreme 
              Soul. When we realise our mistake and are able to trace it back 
              to our original mistake of coming to the material world, we begin 
              to feel remorse and we want to repent. Bhaktivinoda Thakura's purport 
              to the <i>Siksastaka's</i> second <i>sloka</i> recommends: 'If per 
              chance the devotee commits <i>nama-aparadha</i> then with an anguished 
              heart full of contribution, he should become eager to chant continuously, 
              for this alone will uproot his previous offences and also protect 
              him from committing further offences.' Bhaktivinolda Thakura also 
              discusses this matter in the essay <i>Panca-samskara</i>, commenting 
              that gurus in this age do not teach their disciples atonement, and 
              this is not good for the disciple. A disciple who does not understand 
              that he should atone for past sins will feel no remorse and will 
              not give up sinful life. As Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, 'These days, 
              no one thinks about this when accepting a spiritual teacher.' 
            <p align=LEFT>In addition to its more widely used definition as 'voluntary 
              suffering or trouble in Krsna consciousness', <i>tapasya</i> may 
              also be defined as repentance, atonement and the permanent impression 
              of higher sentiment on the soul. <i>Tapasya </i>is not comfortable, 
              but without it the soul cannot live as a Vaisnava and the heart 
              will remain impure. The <i>acaryas</i> sometimes personally express 
              this in their own lives, especially Narottama dasa Thakura and Bhaktivinoda 
              Thakura. In <i> Prarthana</i>, Narottama sings of his remorse about 
              his lacking in <i>sadhana</i>: 'Although again and again I heard 
              the <i>sruti</i> and <i>srmrti </i>scriptures' declaration that 
              one should think of Lord Hari's lotus feet in order to become fearless, 
              I did not chant Lord Krsna's name, I did not meditate on His transcendental 
              lotus feet.' But with hope he concludes, 'I will now concentrate 
              my mind on the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha and Krsna and all my 
              material desires will flee far away.' 
            <p align=LEFT>This is a good example of how rectification follows 
              remorse. But if we don't feel the remorse deeply, it will be difficult 
              to change. In Bhaktivindoa Thakura's <i>Saranagati</i>, he paraphrases 
              the <i>Siksastakam </i>verse: 'Merciful Lord, how great is my misfortune 
              that I feel no appreciation for Your holy name. In such a lamentable 
              state, how will I be freed committing the ten offences to the holy 
              name.' 
            <p align=LEFT>Becoming regretful is difficult; it cannot be imitated 
              and must come sincerely. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments 
              on a Siksatake verse ,'When will my eyes be decorated with tears 
              of love?' by saying, 'This <i>sloka</i> does not refer to those 
              who have naturally moist eyes or who suffer from affectations of 
              artificial ecstasy.' Being free of <i>anarthas</i> will evoke tears 
              of love. When shadow feelings are manifested, they must be honoured 
              too. When devotees wrote to Prabhupada that they would cry upon 
              seeing the Deities, he would encourage such symptoms - saying it 
              was a good thing - even though it was not necessarily a sign of 
              great advancement. Despite it being shadow <i>bhava</i>, Prabhupada 
              honoured it. 
            <p>Here is a final statement about remorse in which Prabhupada encouraged 
              devotees to feel bad about not carrying out their service properly. 
              A devotee once said to him, 'I feel I'm not doing my service nicely.' 
              'This is humbleness,' Prabhupada replied, 'If you go on thinking, 
              "Oh, I did not perform this duty nicely, I should have done it this 
              way", then you will improve. Our love for Krsna keeps growing as 
              long as we think we are not doing the most for Krsna and we must 
              do more. If you think, "Oh, I did this so wonderfully, I am such 
              a nice, sincere devotee", then this is not good. It will be no improvement.' 
            <p
                             align=LEFT>Humility and tolerance can help bring 
              one to remorse and be useful in practising and improving <i>sadhana</i>. 
              Prabhupada mentions in a purport: 'A Vaisnava is always tolerant 
              and submissive like trees and grass. He tolerates insults offered 
              by others, for he is simply interested in chanting the holy name 
              of the Lord without being disturbed.' 
            <p>We must not be disturbed by the conditions of this world, but simply 
              chant. We must learn to tolerate our own slow progress: if, after 
              many years, our mind still wanders every time we chant, we must 
              bring it back. It is also important to be humble. Prabhupada says, 
              'One cannot capture the blowing wind, and it is even more difficult 
              to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind 
              is by chanting Hare Krsna in all humility.' 
            <p align=LEFT>We are often encouraged by the previous <i>acaryas</i> 
              to enter into the <i>Siksastakam</i> prayers because they are full 
              of humility in <i>sadhana</i>. One who can chant in a humble state 
              of mind can always chant Hare Krsna. Bhaktivinoda Thakura stated 
              that these eight <i> slokas</i> should be read, recited, and worshipped 
              by sincere, fortunate souls. 
            <p align=LEFT>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati commented that the <i>sloka 
              </i>'<i>trnad api sunicena</i>' was spoken to help avoid <i> nama-aparadha</i> 
              and <i>namabhasa</i> in chanting. Regarding humility he wrote: 'A 
              true saint never thinks himself to be a Vaisnava or claims to be 
              a guru. He regards himself as a disciple of the whole world.' 
            <p> Bhaktivinoda Thakura explains how to understand Lord Caitanya's 
              statement of thinking ourselves lower than a blade of grass. The 
              ego of a blade of grass is proportionate to its bodily condition; 
              it is a very humble being that is always crushed. Not having much 
              intelligence, it possesses a consciousness close to its condition. 
              A human being who is also in a downtrodden, suffering condition, 
              has an ego blown way out of proportion; such is the disparity between 
              his self-image and his actual condition he thinks he is a wonderful 
              king. The grass thus teaches us humility and honest self-estimation. 
            <p align=LEFT> Writing can also be used as a tool to improve <i>sadhana</i>. 
              Prabhupada always encouraged devotees to write: 'Realisation means 
              you should write, every one of you. What is your realisation? You 
              write your realisation, what you have realised about Krsna. That 
              is required. It is not passive, always you should be active. Whenever 

              you find time, write. Never mind two lines, four lines, but you 
              write your realisations, <i>sravanam-kirtanam </i>. Writing or offering 
              prayers, glories, this is one of the functions of a Vaisnava. You 
              are hearing, but you have to write also. Then writing becomes <i>sravanam</i>, 
              remembering what you have heard from your spiritual master.' 
            <p>Prabhupada talks about writing to remember and worship Krsna. For 
              example, we can keep a diary, not for writing what we had for lunch 
              but for recording our Krsna conscious realisations. The value of 
              this exercise is illustrated by John Howard Griffin, a biographer 
              of Catholic monk, Thomas Merton, who says of Merton: 'His most vital 
              writing is private, what he did for himself, because he made constant 
              notes to help clarify things for himself. He thought and sought 
              to express experience on paper as a self-guide rather than to reveal 
              anything. He sought to get rid of the role, to flee the "role" of 
              the monk in order to become the monk. To be and not merely to appear 
              to be. These are great and profound differences which few perceive, 
              even in the religious life.' 
            <p>Writing helps get beneath the exterior appearance; it helps us 
              to see ourselves honestly and pierce through deceptions so that 
              we can remain steady. We can also use it when we feel that there 
              is some yet unidentifiable problem in our spiritual lives. Unless 
              we start to write, we may never know what this problem is. 
            <p align=LEFT>The essence of <i>sadhana</i> instrruction is given 
              by Srila Rupa Goswami in text eight of <i>Nectar of</i> <i>Instruction</i> 
              (<i>upadesa-saram</i>). In the previous verse, he compassionately 
              analyses the difficulty we experience when chanting Hare Krsna offensively 
              by comparing it to a man who has jaundice and cannot taste sweetness. 
              By taking the sweetest candy, his tongue eventually tastes this 
              sweetness. In the same way, the sweetness of the holy name is realised 
              if we regularly chant. 'It is wonderful that by simply chanting 
              the sweet names every day, a natural relish awakens within the tongue 
              and the disease is gradually destroyed at the root.' This gives 
              us confidence to go on, even though there is imperfection. In his 
              purport to this verse, Prabhupada comments: 'The Krsna Consciousness 
              Movement is especially meant for creating an atmosphere in which 
              people can take to the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra.' 
            <p>In verse eight, Srila Rupa Goswami continues: 'The essence of all 
              advice is that one should utilise one's full time, twenty-four hours 
              a day, in nicely chanting and remembering the Lord's divine name, 
              transcendental form, qualities and eternal pastimes, thereby gradually 
              engaging one's tongue and mind. In this way, one should reside in 
              Vraja or Goloka Vrndavana-dhama and serve Krsna under the guidance 
              of devotees. One should follow in the footsteps of the Lord's beloved 
              devotees, who are deeply attached to His devotional service.' 
            <p align=LEFT> Full-time bhajana is not possible for most of us because, 
              as Prabhupada remarked, 'You Westerners are too restless'. The early 
              hours of the morning is the best time for <i>sadhana</i> and <i>bhajana</i> 
              , but remedial work can also be done on <i>sadhana</i> at that time; 
              'remedial' means to correct a deficiency. Even if we have been devotees 
              for a long time or are in an advanced position in the institution, 
              we have to recognise that we all need remedial work. We have to 
              be our own teacher and take special, intensive care to improve. 
            <p align=LEFT>How do we do this? Plan ahead and take time for a retreat, 
              even if it is in your attic. It should be a place where there are 
              no disturbances and where personal improvements can be made. Pilgrimage 
              to India can be done alone or with a few other devotees and will 
              bring wonderful results - bad habits will be recognised and remorse 
              felt. Sometimes devotees waste their time in India shopping and 
              gossiping, but we should use this time to do this remedial work 
              on our <i>sadhana</i>. Thinking ahead and even using writing can 
              make a pilgrimage spiritually fruitful. Visiting the dhama is also 
              a good time to chant more than sixteen rounds a day. The <i>Padma 
              Purana</i> mentions that the remedy for offensive chanting is to 
              chant constantly. This is not always possible, but during remedial 
              work we can increase our quotas. 
            <p align=LEFT>The next point in Rupa Goswami's verse is that we should 
              chant with the tongue. Prabhupada often told us not to chant in 
              our minds but to vibrate the Hare Krsna mantra aloud. Sometimes 
              devotees asked Prabhupada for more instruction on how to control 
              the mind in chanting. He would never go into much detail but would 
              merely say, 'Hear. You should just hear.' The devotees would reply, 
              'But Prabhupada, how do we control the mind?' He would answer, 'Chanting 
              controls the mind. Just hear.' Although simple, this is a deep preliminary 
              instruction. If we just hear - meaning, we stop the mind's noise 
              and listen with the ears to the sounds being vibrated by the tongue 
              - the further stages will come. Conversely, if we don't hear we 
              will not be able to progress. Rupa Goswami tells us to chant with 
              the tongue and then we will remember with the mind. The tongue enables 
              us to go to the mental stage in chanting - thinking of Krsna's <i>lila</i>. 
            <p>Some devotees say that we are not supposed to think of Krsna's 
              pastimes when we chant, but that is not what Prabhupada said: 'I 
              think you should know that it is not offensive (to think of Krsna's 
              pastimes while chanting) but rather, it is required. One must try 
              for the point where he simply hears Krsna, and immediately all of 
              Krsna, His pastimes, His form, His quality, are in his thoughts 
              of Krsna. One who cannot always think of Krsna, let him hear always 
              "Hare Krsna", and when he has perfected this art, then always he 
              will remember Krsna, His activities, His qualities, etc.' 
            <p align=LEFT> Bhaktivinode Thakura says in <i>Harinama-cintamani</i>: 
              'From the holy name, gradually the Lord's form, qualities and pastimes 
              blossom. The entire panorama of Lord Krsna's pastimes is present 
              in the holy name. This is an advanced stage in chanting.' He further 
              explains: 'The introspective devotee must at first discard the ten 
              offences and simply meditate on the holy name, trying to chant constantly. 
              He should distinctly pronounce the holy name and meditate upon the 
              transcendental sound vibration. When his chanting is steady, clear 
              and blissful, he should try to meditate on the Syamasundara form 
              of the Lord. With chanting beads in hand, his chanting and meditation 
              should seek out the form of the holy name. He will indeed see with 
              spiritual vision what the real meaning represents ..' He even recommends 
              sitting in front of the Deity to see the form while chanting. 
            <p
                             align=LEFT>The verse also recommends residing in 
              Vraja. If we cannot go there we should learn to think of Vrndavana 
              by reading books and meditating on the impressions we gathered when 
              we went there, remembering the <i> parikama</i> sights and sounds 
              and praying to the devotees of Vrndavana. This is a stage that we 
              eventually have to practise if we want to go to Goloka-Vrndavana. 
              This should be done under the guidance of an expert Vaisnava, and 
              eventually we should follow a particular devotee in Krsna- <i>lila</i>, 
              such as Mother Yasoda, a cowherd boy, a particular gopi or a manjari. 
              Chanting, pronouncing, hearing in the mind and thinking of the form 
              and pastimes of Krsna, leads to the ideal <i>bhajana </i>by which 
              one can go back to Godhead. 
            <p>Reading is as important as chanting. Rupa Goswami says that we 
              should think about Krsna's pastimes, but how can we think about 
              them unless we regularly hear them? Prabhupada stated, 'Whenever 
              you get time, you should read my books.' There is no limit to how 
              much we should read if we can use that in Krsna's service. 
            <p align=LEFT>One way to read is to study, of which there are many 
              different paths. One is to give lectures: if we are fortunate enough 
              to give lectures in the temple, then we have to prepare by reading 
              Prabhupada's books. Writing - especially essays, for <i>Back to 
              Godhead</i> and other Krsna conscious newsletters - requires that 
              we read and prepare our topic. Taking VIHE courses also forces us 
              to study. Aside from studying, reading, can, of course, be something 
              that is simply done for enjoyment; <i>sadhu-sanga</i>, reading with 
              others, can be a pleasant social act or an exchange of love. Reading 
              every day with one or two friends or between husband and wife, is 
              necessary on many levels. It is a nectarean activity which draws 
              us away from pressing matters into transcendence; it strengthens 
              relationships among devotees. We can also practise prayerful reading, 
              praying and meditating on a small amount of material; thinking about 
              how Krsna is speaking directly to us and praying that He will please 
              reveal the meaning of the passage. Prabhupada encouraged variety; 
              if reading is tedious, other methods should be tried to spark interest 
              -anything that results in rapt attention is considered good. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>Sadhana</i> can be defined in a wider sense: spiritual 
              advancement doesn't only mean more chanting and reading, and less 
              of other types of service. This may not be the right way for some 
              devotees. We should think of the ideal state we want to achieve 
              and how we will reach it. We can look forward to the time when we 
              will not be so passionate and be able to read and chant more - but 
              we shouldn't wait too long. Prabhupada held morning and evening 
              classes, but during the day he wanted his devotees to be active 
              preachers. 
            <p align=LEFT>The more we work at <i>sadhana</i> and improve our service 
              attitude, the greater the reward. However, <i>sadhana </i>also requires 
              austerity; Prabhupada made the point that the chanting of the <i> 
              maha-mantra</i> must be accompanied by strict following of the four 
              regulative principles. In this way, chanting would be effective 
              immediately. 
            <p align=LEFT> Remorse leads to rectification and by working at this 
              - through <i>sadhana</i> and rendering service to the guru and ISKCON 
              - we may receive Krsna's mercy. This stage is known as <i>vaidhi-bhakti</i>, 
              the clearing of <i> anarthas </i>from the heart. Rectification leads 
              to reunion, the spontaneous stage which relishes Krsna's service 
              through His qualities, pastimes, form and name on the liberated 
              platform. Reunion can mean a return to our original relationship 
              with Krsna as His eternal servant.
