            <p><i>This exciting report from the Riga, Latvia temple, shows how 
              a bad public perception of ISKCON can be dramatically changed. It 
              is a great example of how, by applying communications principles, 
              our mission becomes recognised and respected by all levels of society. 
              </i> </p>
            <p align=LEFT>Latvia, one of the Baltic Republics, has a population 
              of 2.5 million people. ISKCON has had a presence here since the 
              early eighties. There are presently two temples located here; the 
              main one (opened in 1990) is situated in the heart of the capital, 
              Riga, and houses fifty devotees. Public response to ISKCON was initially 
              very positive; many people visited the temple and attended festivals 
              such as the annual Ratha Yatra. However, it wasn't long before opposition 
              to 'the new eastern religion' began to emerge. One lady in particular 
              - the disturbed parent of a young member - began a campaign that 
              nearly caused the closure of the Riga temple.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1990, the girl in question began regularly visiting 
              the temple. She was a music student at the Lutheran seminary and 
              her mother didn't appreciate her new interest in Krsna consciousness. 
              In fact she became so disturbed by it she began beating her daughter, 
              who subsequently ran away from home and moved into a flat with a 
              school friend. She continued to practise Krsna consciousness despite 
              her mother's protests. Seeing the situation as hopeless, the irate 
              mother approached the media pleading, 'Please help me to save my 
              daughter from this satanic sect'.</p>
            <p>The vigorous media campaign which followed aroused other parents, 
              who eventually got together to stage a lively demonstration in front 
              of Parliament House. The Hare Krsna movement was suddenly viewed 
              as a 'destructive cult' that broke up families. ISKCON Riga decided 
              to take the matter to court, charging the parents' group and one 
              major newspaper with misrepresentation and slander. Unfortunately, 
              the devotees had never undertaken this kind of action before and 
              did not understand the legal system. In early 1993 the court reached 
              a decision - it neither ruled in ISKCON's favour nor did it exonerate 
              the defendants. In the interim, negative media articles had continued 
              to circulate and with the resultant court findings, the future looked 
              bleak. The temple was struggling to pay the rent, the public had 
              began to despise ISKCON and the council was threatening to move 
              the devotees out. In addition, the government department responsible 
              for the registration of religions met with temple representatives 
              and expressed their concern about ISKCON's reputation. The situation 
              looked grim.</p>
            <p>Back in the spring of 1992, however, the temple had started a Food 
              for Life programme. The service began humbly with only plain porridge 
              being distributed from the temple premises to approximately sixty 
              elderly people. During the winter of 1992, the programme began to 
              gain momentum - the word was out that the Hare Krsnas were serving 
              free food. Soon more than three hundred people were queuing to receive 
              their portion of hot porridge, bread, vegetables and tea. A registration 
              system was subsequently introduced to control the increasing numbers, 
              with recipients being required to produce documents that proved 
              they were socially disadvantaged. Qualifying individuals received 
              a numbered card which indicated the time they should arrive for 
              their free meal. In this way, the large queues were avoided as people 
              were coming throughout the afternoon instead of at lunch time alone.</p>
            <p>By the spring of 1993, the programme had expanded to approximately 
              eight hundred meals served per day, with queues of people stretching 
              down the main street of the city. The public and council began to 
              take note. At that time H. H. Gopal Krsna Goswami visited Riga and 
              represented Hare Krsna Food for Life as an international co-ordinator. 
              He met with the mayor of Riga, following which the mayor wrote a 
              recommendation for the programme.</p>
            <p>The number of people being served food soon became unmanageable 
              again. The only solution was to relocate the operation to the car 
              park at the side of temple. At the same time, the programme reached 
              a milestone - the serving of the one hundred thousandth free meal. 
              The mayor was invited as an honoured guest to serve the meal, and 
              the event was covered by local newspapers and television - public 
              opinion was turning once more.</p>
            <p>With the mayor's assistance, ISKCON Riga was granted a five year 
              lease on the temple building and free rent until 1996. Favourable 
              articles started appearing in the press. Food and money donations 
              have increased to the extent that the temple no longer needs to 
              buy provisions and all its running costs are covered. ISKCON's reputation 
              had changed completely.</p>
            <p>To date, ISKCON Riga has distributed one hundred and ninety thousand 
              meals, making it the biggest free food distribution centre in Latvia. 
              Up to five hundred people a day, six days a week, are served food 
              from the temple premises, with a further 700 meals being distributed 
              to needy people in their own homes. Six full-time devotees are needed 
              to manage this operation. The programme primarily caters for people 
              from four disadvantaged categories: pensioners, invalids, large 
              families and the unemployed. Distribution begins at 4.00 p.m. each 
              day and continues until 8.00 p.m.</p>
            <p>The programme receives weekly donations of grapes, oranges, bananas, 
              pears, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, rice, carrots and sugar. In addition, 
              approximately three thousand US dollars has been received in cash, 
              as well as cooking equipment and building materials. However, the 
              best result has been the overwhelming appreciation from the general 
              public. Practically everyone in Riga now recognises the Hare Krsnas 
              as the 'people who are caring for the needy'. There has not been 
              a single negative media report during 1993 and the relationship 
              with local government officials is excellent.</p>
            <p>Hare Krsna Food for Life in Riga is officially registered as a 
              charity, with bank accounts and book-keeping independent of ISKCON. 
              The latest addition to the programme is a non profit-making vegetarian 
              restaurant for low income earners, which was opened by city officials 
              on 30 September 1993, together with a clothes 'give-away' service 
              and discount shop. Latvian devotees also plan to apply for overseas 
              food and clothes donations in the near future.</p>
