              <p><i>Dr Melton is considered America's senior scholar in the field 
                of new and unconventional religions, having studied them for more 
                than twenty-five years. In this article, he discusses religious 
                dialogue in terms of the consequences of today's multicultural 
                and multi-faith world. Although ISKCON does not represent a new 
                religion, it does experience similar cultural, religious and sociological 
                reactions. This paper provides a valuable insight into the issues 
                and concerns surrounding interfaith dialogue. </i> </p>
              </div>
            <p>Future historians will surely place the rise of the numerous new 
              and unconventional religious movements high on any list of important 
              changes in the religious situation in the West in the latter half 
              of the twentieth century. Literally thousands of religious groups 
              are now building their communities of faith in every part of the 
              world. While some which broadly fall under the label 'new religions' 
              have traditions which reach back into the nineteenth century (or 
              even earlier), most were formed this century and had their greatest 
              success in the last generation. The Unification Church, the Jesus 
              People Movement, the Church of Scientology and the Nation of Goddess 
              Worshippers are just some of the groups which become controversial 
              in the sixties and seventies, in addition to numerous guru-orientated 
              Hindu and yoga groups which proselytise members from European and 
              North America young adults. Also included are those nineteenth century 
              groups such as Theosophy, Christian Science, Spiritualism, Vedanta, 
              the Baha'i Faith and New Thought, which have expanded around the 
              world, together with the Western occult tradition which has found 
              its most expansive expression in what is termed 'the New Age movement'. 
            <p>More than any other factor, the emergence of all these different 
              religious communities symbolised the quantum leap in pluralism experienced 
              globally. This is the result of the rapid improvement in communication 
              and transportation which began with World War II and facilitated 
              the mass movement of ideas and peoples from one country to another. 
              Concurrently, the overthrow of colonialism, the fall of Marxist 
              Communism and the rise of great urban centres have conspired to 
              create a new climate of freedom which has significantly weakened 
              governmental power to enforce religious conformity. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In practical terms, this new pluralism means that 
              in every metropolitan centre in the world (except in the few remaining 
              countries with stringent legal restraints), literally hundreds of 
              religions representing views and following practices in sharp divergence 
              from those familiar to the parent culture have been joined by revivalistic 
              movements (offering fresh, innovative approaches to the older religious 
              forms) and a few new ones (such as New Thought and Baha'i), creating 
              what at first sight might appear to be a chaotic religious environment. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Most countries are considering, or have considered, 
              the legal implications of the religious transformation within their 
              cultures which is tied to the influx of religious teachers and diverse 
              religious perspectives from all over the world. The emergence of 
              new religious movements in any one country is but a single aspect 
              of a spreading transnational worldwide culture which includes multinational 
              corporations (Coca-Cola, McDonalds), global information systems 
              (CNN) and media superstars (Michael Jackson). 
            <p align=JUSTIFY> From a national perspective, much of the controversy 
              is fuelled by the lingering fantasy that some semblance of religious 
              homogeneity is necessary and desirable for the survival and strength 
              of a nation, or the notion that a strong religious establishment 
              promotes morality and piety more effectively than religious pluralism. 
              Within the past generation, this controversy had become focused 
              around individuals from a nominally religious family who not only 
              adopted an intense religious life but often a career within a religion 
              both unfamiliar and unacceptable to the rest of the family. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The controversy surrounding religious pluralism would 
              seem to be a natural priority on the interfaith community's agenda. 
              Rather than the abstract and idealistic (and thus often irrelevant) 
              dialogue which frequently constitutes such interactions, the new 
              religions provide an opportunity to explore unfamiliar territory 
              and resolve significant conflict. 
            <p>The older interfaith leadership, which has done so much to ameliorate 
              the centuries-old Jewish-Christian tensions, has been very slow 
              to open dialogue with the new religions and has often tried to wash 
              its hands of the whole issue by creating arbitrary definitions which 
              push these 'new' religions outside of the religious community. By 
              doing this, the religious community simply abdicates leadership 
              and ignores the problems which must be overcome in the next generation 
              if interfaith dialogue is to be something more than the private 
              consultations of a few powerful religious administrators or the 
              theorising of religious studies pundits. 
            <p>The views expressed in this paper have been developed and refined 
              over the past year, during which time I have had the opportunity 
              to participate in a series of dialogues in San Francisco which have 
              involved a variety of representatives from both 'old' and 'new' 
              religions. It has been an enlightening experience and has confirmed 
              my belief that there is a lot to learn from such dialogues. However, 
              it is no easy task bringing people together, and a series of challenges 
              were faced in producing the small degree of success achieved in 
              this endeavour. 
            <p><b> Challenges to be faced</b> 
            <p>Bringing new religions into the dialogical situation initially 
              forces a reappraisal of some perennial problems. For example, every 
              issue under discussion eventually leads to the basic theological 
              differences concerning the nature of truth, religion and revelation. 
              The dominant Western religions have generally assumed the existence 
              of a personal deity who reveals the ultimate Truth in the form of 
              many truths which can be (and usually are) written down in a book. 
              Eastern religions, on the other hand, have tended to find Truth 
              revealed in the mystical experience of union with the Divine, from 
              which one can derive lesser truths about spiritual life. In other 
              words, Western theology insists there is only one true way whereas 
              Eastern theology sees most religious paths as leading to the same 
              goal. 
            <p>The challenge facing interfaith dialogue is the construction of 
              a common language to facilitate discussion, and resolution, of these 
              difference. The ever-present temptation is to ignore the problem 
              and allow two exclusive circles of conversation to emerge. The inclusion 
              of new religions in such dialogue intensifies this problem in that 
              the majority of them have been imported to Europe and North America 
              as a result of the massive influx of Asians into the West since 
              World War Two. Once limited to college world religion classes or 
              scholarly conventions, East-West religious dialogue is now at such 
              a fundamental level that even parents find their basic theological 
              perspectives called into question by their offspring. 
            <p><i>New religions call attention to old religious conflicts </i> 
            <p>An important issue for the West is the tendency of 'new' religions 
              to highlight the way in which, historically, Christian establishments 
              have used the coercive power of the state. The nature-oriented pagan 
              groups speak of the great witch-hunts of the early modern era; Hindu, 
              Buddhist and African groups still sting from the imposition of Christianity 
              by colonial governments; Native Americans recall the denigration 
              of their traditionalist faiths and Jewish groups voice concerns 
              about anti-Semitism. The contemporary presence of non-Christian 
              religions within a traditionally Christian culture is forced home 
              each time a nominally Christian family discovers a new Buddhist, 
              Hindu, Moonie or Scientologist sitting at the dinner table initiating 
              a discomforting dialogue on the shortcomings of the Church in relation 
              to its religious neighbours. 
            <p><i>New religions force consideration of ongoing religious polemics 
              </i> 
            <p align=LEFT>Every religious community justifies its own existence 
              by negative references to the larger religious environment, falsely 
              characterising competing religions and hiding behind stereotypes 
              which may be carried from generation to generation. In the West, 
              the presentations of Jewish, Roman and Greek religions in the Christian 
              <i>New Testament </i>have become the basis of the most extreme stereotyping 
              of other faiths. Muslims are also creating awareness of the ubiquity 
              of negative images of Islam in contemporary society. 
            <p>Once new religions are included in interfaith dialogue, religious 
              alliances based upon the demonisation of religious 'outsiders' are 
              no longer possible. In the last generation, new religions were the 
              object of the most vicious characterisations and stereotyping since 
              the Nazi propaganda against the Jews and that of Stalin against 
              Eastern Orthodoxy. This stereotyping, similar in nature to older 
              terms such as 'infidel' or 'heretic', has centred on the word 'cult', 
              a depersonalising label that strips new religions of their status 
              and banishes them to the edge of society confined to religious 'leper 
              colonies'. With the inclusion of new religions in interfaith dialogue, 
              there are no 'cults' left. 
            <p>New religious movements also question the attempts of governments 
              and national cultures to identify themselves with a single religious 
              community from which either the majority, or a significant minority, 
              of the public have withdrawn their support. In their diversity new 
              religions have challenged the whole approach to religion of terms 
              of majorities and minorities, in which the great virtue has been 
              the condescending toleration of the minority by the majority. They 
              offer an alternative image of the world, based on a global religious 
              diversity, in which every community is a minority. The great religious 
              virtue has now become religious freedom. 
            <p><b>New challenges teaching new duties</b> 
            <p>Apart from the perennial difficulties underlying interfaith dialogue, 
              new religious movements bring their own particular problems to the 
              dialogical situation. For example, they usually come into discussions 
              with a vocal challenge to the religious status quo. It is a fact 
              that many of the recently formed religions were founded either to 
              meet a need that, in their perception, the older religions have 
              neglected (spirituality) or to correct a perceived wrong which the 
              older religions are perpetuating (racism, sexism). Thus they arrive 
              at the dialogical situation with a lengthy agenda of real or imagined, 
              stated or unstated, grievances. Uncovering these grievances and 
              placing them on the table is integral to any dialogical process 
              participated in by new religious movements. These stereotypes often 
              rest upon strongly charged emotions resulting from intense experiences 
              of individuals who have converted to a new religion from the more 
              traditional one into which they were born. 
            <p>Occasionally, new religions even go so far as to question the very 
              nature of religion itself. They act as innovative religious gestalts, 
              re-organising spiritual life in unique, and often unfamiliar, ways. 
              Due to the legal implications of being called a 'religion' - or 
              the attempts by the more well-established religious bodies to serve 
              as a canon by which the nature of religious life is to be measured 
              and defined - many new religions actually deny their religiosity. 
              They consider the term 'religion' to represent everything which 
              they want to leave behind, be it a sophisticated and dehumanising 
              organisational structure, an imposed statement of creed, an enforced 
              moral code or mandatory services of worship. 
            <p>New religions often have a very narrow focus on the basic vision 
              or truth in response to which they were founded. This can present 
              its own problems, especially amongst first generation members of 
              the group, and will frequently lead to a period of separatism in 
              which the group explores its own truth and concentrates its efforts 
              on attracting new members. During this formative stage new groups 
              may avoid interfaith dialogue altogether, lacking the self-critique 
              and re-evaluation that is integral to this process. Attacks from 
              the media, rival groups or former members will compound this reluctance 
              to participate, as the group will understandably be reluctant to 
              expose itself to the possibility of further criticism arising from 
              this dialogue. 
            <p>Critics of new religions have often complained that there is no 
              point in attempting dialogue with them as they are only interested 
              in converting non-believers to their faith. However, those of us 
              who have had experience with such groups have found that that the 
              overwhelming majority are only too eager to participate and those 
              that have gone through a period of separatism soon come out of it. 
            <p>Those new religions which have expressed a willingness to engage 
              in dialogue generally lack a language in which to discuss many of 
              the interfaith issues. They have been slow to develop either a broad 
              theology or a systematic ethical stance, and have yet to explore 
              the implications of their basic religious vision. Time must therefore 
              be allotted for new religions to consider the logic of their situation 
              in the light of the vision they espouse. 
            <p><i>Anti-cult bigotry</i> 
            <p>By far the most significant obstacle to interfaith dialogue is 
              not found among those enunciated above. For dialogue to proceed, 
              participants must confront the vicious anti-cult bigotry which has 
              permeated our culture during the last twenty years. Spread by what 
              has become an international counter-cult network, propaganda about 
              cults has created an intense, emotionally-charged, negative image 
              about new religions, especially the more controversial ones. So 
              pervasive is that image that many people otherwise committed to 
              interfaith dialogue and who have themselves repeatedly experienced 
              the destructiveness of popular negative stereotypes, have refused 
              to participate in interfaith dialogue if one or more specified groups 
              are present. Even members of the less controversial new religions 
              have been hesitant to make contact with representatives of more 
              controversial groups. 
            <p>The anti-religious views promoted by organisations such as the 
              Cult Awareness Network (CAN) and its sister organisations around 
              the world, present a significant challenge to the religious community 
              as a whole. They have had measurable success in muddying the waters 
              of religious understanding and further dividing an already dangerously 
              fractured religious community. From the its formation in the seventies 
              - under the name Citizens Freedom Foundation - to the present day, 
              CAN has maintained a systematic, worldwide attack on new religions. 
              Their methods include the kidnapping and forced deprogramming of 
              members, promotion of oppressive anti-religious legislation, attempts 
              to have courts and law enforcement agencies intervene in members' 
              civil liberties and the advocacy of the pseudo-scientific concept 
              of 'destructive' mind control'. It also added a new tactic recently, 
              encouraging people associated with CAN to make false reports on 
              child abuse against members of new religions. Whilst most of their 
              efforts have ultimately failed CAN has, however, succeeded in creating 
              a popular image of the new religious movements as 'destructive cults', 
              and in its promotion of this view has found an ally in a sensation-oriented 
              press. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>There are now anti-cult organisations operating in 
              every state of the US, every province in Canada, every country in 
              Europe and South Africa and even in Australia and Japan. These groups 
              have persistently distorted the public's understanding of new religions. 
              They have employed all the classic techniques used in the past to 
              discredit Semitism and Catholicism, yet few leaders within the interfaith 
              community have openly questioned these tactics. The elimination 
              of anti-cultism - which I believe to be a major obstacle to creating 
              a parliament of religions - should be on the agenda of every interfaith 
              group in the world. 
            <p><b>The assets of new religions</b> 
            <p>While there are a number of impediments to initiating an interfaith 
              dialogue which includes the new religions, it should be noted that 
              they do bring with them some unique assets. Firstly although they 
              have been the object to persecution themselves they have not similarly 
              engaged in this practice. Whilst this is probably due to their never 
              having been aligned with governmental power, it nevertheless means 
              they do not have to work through an agenda of old animosity, and 
              thus dialogue can quickly proceed to immediate human concerns. At 
              the same time, as the present victims of discrimination, they have 
              vivid experiences to relate of the effects of such action and the 
              manner in which is distorts their appropriation of spiritual life. 
            <p>Secondly, many of the new religions have originated at points of 
              convergence between the older religious communities, especially 
              Christianity and Eastern religions, and attempt to combine elements 
              from two or more of the more traditional faiths in creating a new 
              gestalt. Some of this syncretism comes from visionary leaders who, 
              having been raised in one tradition, appropriate insights from another. 
              More often, though (as vividly illustrated by the Baha'i faith or 
              the Unification Church), a new religion is built around the vision 
              of a universal faith which transcends the tribal, national or ethnic 
              identifications frequently associated with the older traditions. 
              Therefore, it would seem that members of new religions have much 
              to share about the possibility of reconciling some of the seemingly 
              irreconcilable differences experienced by the older faiths. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Thirdly, because of their recent origins new religions 
              usually concentrate on present problems and emerging opportunities 
              which the older religions (in expending a considerable amount of 
              energy preserving their traditions) often neglect. For example, 
              new religious movements have shown an interest in the latest findings 
              and trends in psychology; they are ready to take the lead in discussions 
              on the nature of personal religious dynamics and the effect of different 
              religious practices in promoting a sense of the presence of the 
              transcendent. Not having accumulated a list of regulations based 
              upon the problems encountered in the past they are ready to engage 
              in an open-ended exploration of contemporary ethical issues, bringing 
              new awareness which forces a reconsideration of more established 
              wisdom. 
            <p><b>Spiritual environmentalism</b> 
            <p>As a direct response to the concerns of the pluralism created by 
              the new religions, in February 1992 a broadly based group of leaders 
              from both the newer and older religions established quarterly meetings 
              in San Francisco (which are still being held today). As an experiment, 
              the group began to test a relatively mew format for interreligious 
              dialogue termed 'spiritual environmentalism', the intention being 
              to nurture a new climate of openness. 
            <p>Spiritual environmentalism builds upon several foundational considerations. 
              Firstly, it assumes that the radical pluralism now being experienced 
              will continue to increase worldwide for the foreseeable future, 
              therefore ensuring no one religion will be able to dominate the 
              public sphere. Thus, the diversity integral to the contemporary 
              situation can either be used as an excuse for greater social division 
              or as a trumpet call to engage in mutual action to solve problems 
              and work together for the common good. Since we show no signs of 
              moving towards a universal religion - and it seems utopian to search 
              for one - the group has raised the possibility that meeting around 
              individual faith commitments might provide a starting point for 
              understanding and trust that will, on the one hand, allow us to 
              stop hurting each other in the name of religion and, on the other, 
              to actively co-operate in building a better social context. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Secondly, spiritual environmentalism assumes that 
              none of us, including the most dedicated and faithful of scholars, 
              can become familiar with all species in the religious garden. However, 
              we can ensure we fully understand a representative sample and make 
              it our business to get to know, on more than just a superficial 
              level, a variety of individuals who will commit their lives to a 
              religious vision far different from our own, Such familiarity in 
              the present provides a reservoir of experiences that reduced fear 
              and prevents initial pre-judgements when encountering other new 
              religions in the future. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Thirdly, spiritual environmentalism rejects the premise 
              that if people of differing religious beliefs and practices simply 
              engage in dialogue, broad areas of agreement begin to emerge and 
              some commonly agreed principles and bases for tolerance and accord 
              suddenly appear. Such agreements might indeed be possible if I talk 
              as the member of one group with a member of a single other group, 
              but experience has shown that whatever accord I reach with that 
              group becomes a bone of contention when I speak to another group. 
            <p>Fourthly, spiritual environmentalism suggests that little is to 
              be gained from formal discussions of theological differences except 
              for the opportunity to broaden understanding and appreciation of 
              the world in which others live. Rather, our time together is more 
              profitably spent searching for elements of our shared social life 
              which make it possible for each individual to survive, pursue those 
              benefits which are the gift of the world to humanity and explore 
              those conditions which allow each religious community to express 
              its version of spiritual life and to share these experiences with 
              the larger human family. 
            <p>For spiritually-minded people, the search for the common good begins 
              in the centre of our faith life. It begins in taking the risk of 
              exposing to public scrutiny those aspects of our commitment which 
              gives us vitality and makes our faith so attractive that we are 
              determined to spend our entire life within it. It starts in articulating 
              a vision of the divine life and a sharing of our experience of it. 
              We have found that when we share what we most essentially believe, 
              what we do to bring into consciousness the presence of the divine 
              in our life and what happens to us as a result of these experiences, 
              it creates an atmosphere of intimacy and respect in which discussion 
              of even bitter differences can proceed without disruption. Once 
              one is able to honour the other who is different, then the way is 
              opened for a mutual search for the common good. We have also discovered 
              that there is one thing that distinguishes someone who has experienced 
              the divine however inarticulate they may be - they ultimately want 
              the best, not just for their particular community but for the whole 
              human family. 
            <p><b>A road of change</b> 
            <p> In good humour, but with all seriousness, I warn all who would 
              join in this type of dialogue that they put their self-identity 
              at risk. Merely listening to an individual of a different faith 
              talking about their experience of the transcendent and the conclusions 
              they have drawn from that encounter, invariably changes one. If 
              you have found salvation in Jesus Christ, if you have submitted 
              to Allah, if you have altered your consciousness in meditation, 
              if you have unravelled a koan or had your kundalini awakened, the 
              sharing of another person's spiritual experienced provides new information 
              of great interest, albeit it comes from outside your own religious 
              community. To engage in dialogue means you now encounter your neighbour's 
              religion, not as new information to be studied and codified, but 
              as a appealing approach to the divine that at the very least commands 
              respect for the follower. It will be very difficult to speak evil 
              of a different religious group after speaking of your life with 
              God to a member of that group who has, in turn, shared with you 
              their own experiences of the transcendental realm and the events 
              which changed their life. It will be difficult to dismiss a group 
              which may at one time appeared odd or unacceptable, after you have 
              heard the testimony of its mature practitioners. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In conclusion, I offer up my group's experiment for 
              whatever benefit it might bring and invite others to initiate the 
              sort of broad dialogue we have experienced. The rules are simple, 
              though commitment in time and energy are high. The risks are very 
              real but the potential benefits are equally great. We have no doubt 
              that interfaith dialogue is crucial to the survival and understanding 
              of humankind and it our hope that the energy expended in coming 
              together as we are doing will, in the short term, heal the social 
              wounds in our own neighbourhoods and, ultimately, profit the world 
              in ways which at present we cannot perceive.
