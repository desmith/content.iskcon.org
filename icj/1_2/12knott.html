            <p><i>A paper on the Hare Krsna movement and its understanding of 
              its earliest roots and sources, its debts to and perspectives on 
              the past would, I think, be an interesting one. I also believe that 
              such a paper cannot yet be written or understood - at least not 
              without extensive footnotes. The short discussion which follows, 
              therefore, details the obstacles encountered en route to a descriptive 
              account. </i> 
            <p align=LEFT>In 1977, a postgraduate in the early stages of conducting 
              a phenomenological study of Indian Hindus in Britain went with a 
              party of Leeds Gujaratis to Bhaktivedanta Manor (a major UK temple 
              community of the International Society for Krsna Consciousness (or 
              the Hare Krsna Movement, as it is better known). With the newly 
              acquired tools of objectivity and empathy the student was making 
              some progress in learning about the practice of Hinduism amongst 
              South Asians recently settled here, ISKCON being just one example 
              of the ways in which Hinduism was expressed in its new context. 
              In the course of the tour of the Manor, the postgraduate met and 
              talked with an eager <i>brahmacari</i>. The substance of the interchange 
              was that he maintained the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> was five thousand 
              years old while the student was convinced that it was written around 
              200 BC. The student felt the conversation could not progress beyond 
              this point because it rested on the <i>raison d`etre</i> of both 
              the devotee of Krsna and the scholar involved in the discipline 
              of the history of religions. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>I admit that this conclusion is a little exaggerated. 
              Many scholars, before and since, have studied New Religious Movements 
              (NRMs) in general and the Hare Krsna Movement in particular. However, 
              I believed at the time that this conversation marked the end of 
              my relations with the devotees of Krsna Consciousness. Objectivity 
              and empathy thrown out the window I returned home, heatedly proclaiming 
              their ignorance and by extension, the folly of their appearance, 
              behaviour and beliefs. I ignored my own inability to undertake decent 
              phenomenological research in my feelings of righteous indignation. 
              In 1983, however, I was asked to write a book on the Hare Krsna 
              movement. By then I had largely forgotten my prejudices and was 
              able to treat this delicate issue with a little more common sense 
              and sensitivity. 
            <p align=LEFT>To return to my original conclusion, it is not difficult 
              to see what this argument represents for the two opponents. To the 
              devotee, the <i> Bhagavad-gita</i> is considered to be <i>sruti</i> 
              or revealed scripture. It is part of the Vedic canon written by 
              Vyasadeva from the breath of Lord Brhama five thousand years ago. 
              The Hare Krsna <i>brahmacari</i>, along with many Indian Hindus, 
              believed this with all his heart. For the student or scholar of 
              religion, however, a very different picture emerges. The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              is considered to be an independent part of the epic poem, the <i>Mahabharata</i> 
              which, while discussing earlier events, was not written until approximately 
              200 BCE-CE 200. Scholars accept this theory on the strength of the 
              apparently sound research of academics in the fields of linguistic 
              analysis, archaeology and comparative literary and historical studies. 
              Faith in the origins of revealed scripture is important to the majority 
              of devotees whereas dependence on historical facts is vital to most 
              scholars of religion. To some extent this issue, both for devotee 
              and scholar , becomes one of 'authority'. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>It should be emphasised, however, that although this 
              constitutes an important subject for both devotee and scholar, it 
              is only one amongst many. Numerous interesting interviews, encounters 
              and dialogues have taken place between researchers and devotees 
              in the UK and, more particularly, in the USA. There are two ways 
              to overcome the debate on dates: either it can just be put to one 
              side or the scholar can follow the example of Judah (1974) and admit 
              the whole area of historical dating in early India is open to serious 
              question. 
            <p align=LEFT>The debate does raise a number of interesting questions 
              and issues if we are prepared to stand still and examine it rather 
              than battling it out or resorting to the 'safer' option of studying 
              Vedic literature in general rather than the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              in particular. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Scholarly views of the content and dating of Vedic 
              literature </b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Such views are many and various, although the general 
              consensus of opinion dates the arrival of the Aryans from Central 
              Europe at approximately 1500 BCE and the Vedas themselves at around 
              1500-1200 BCE. As Chaudhuri (1979) points out, there is very little 
              evidence to support this particular date for the composition of 
              the Vedas (nor any other date for that matter). Some scholars opt 
              for even earlier dates; for example, Radhakrishnan and Moore (1957) 
              suggest approximate dates of 2500 BCE for the arrival of Aryan culture 
              and 1500 BC E for the composition of the Vedas. Recent discoveries 
              of cities in the Indus Valley have led archaeologists to date Harappan 
              culture at between 3000 and 1500 BCE, and Aryan culture after 1500 
              BCE (Tharpar, 1966). None of these dates are conclusive, however, 
              and it is well known that the whole process of dating settlements 
              and texts in early India is very difficult. As Tharpar (1966) states, 
              the Painted-Grey Ware found on archaeological sites in the West 
              is still only 'tentatively' associated with the Aryans. In addition, 
              Judah comments: 
            <ul>
              <p>The dating of all early Hindu literature is subject to considerable 
                controversy and must be considered tentative. For example, the 
                four traditional Vedas ... represent material that was transmitted 
                orally in archaic Sanskrit for centuries ... Since none of these 
                compilations have manuscripts dating close to their time of origin, 
                dating is risky, and one must depend largely on internal criticism 
                such as changes in language, thought and locale. 
            </ul>
            <p>Dating may be inconclusive but few scholars have felt happy to 
              discuss Vedic literature and culture without it. (Dasgupta [1975] 
              and Chaudhuri [1979] try not to speculate, although the latter certainly 
              has opinions on the matter). 
            <p align=LEFT>Moving on from the question of composition dates to 
              the scope and content of the Vedas, we find less controversy. Vedic 
              literature is generally considered to include all <i>sruti</i> , 
              that is the four <i>Samhitas</i>, the <i>Brahmanas</i>, <i>Aranyakas</i> 
              and <i>Upanishads</i>. All other Sanskrit religious texts are <i>smrti</i> 
              (remembered not heard). This category includes the <i>Vedanta Sutra 
              </i>, the 'Epics' (such as the <i>Bhagavad-gita) </i>and the <i>Puranas</i>. 
              Most of the major concepts in Hinduism are detailed in what scholars 
              define 'Vedic literature'- <i>varna</i>, <i>ashrama</i>, <i>karma</i>, 
              <i> samsara</i>, <i>moksha</i> etc., although most of these appear 
              in later compositions of literature (such as the <i>Upanishads</i>) 
              rather than earlier scriptures. Some aspects of the Aryan culture 
              can also be ascertained from these texts (Kunhan Raja, Altekar [1958], 
              Tharpar [1966]). 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This is the popular view of Vedic literature which 
              is put forward in all standard books on India and its religions 
              (for example, Tharpar, Hopkins, Zaehner, Brocklington etc). For 
              students of religious studies, and indeed for most scholars, this 
              view is the accepted authority. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The 'devotional' view of Vedic literature</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Two views could hardly be more different than the scholarly 
              and devotional ones on this issue. To devotees of the Hare Krsna 
              Movement, Vedic literature begins with Krsna (God). Through His 
              expansion as Lord Brahma, Krsna revealed vital knowledge to Vyasadeva, 
              including the four <i>Samhitas</i>, the <i>Brahmanas</i> and <i>Vedanta 
              Sutra </i>. In addition, Vyasadeva was requested to compile the 
              'perfect commentary' on the <i>Vedanta Sutra</i>, and thus on the 
              whole corpus of early Sanskrit literature, in the form of the <i>Bhagavata 
              Purtana </i>(or <i> Srimad Bhagavatam</i>). Devotees believe this 
              exchange took place approximately five thousand years ago before 
              the advent of the present age of <i>Kali yuga</i>. 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, 
                ancient Sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. 
                Originally preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first 
                put into writing by Srila Vyasadeva, the 'literary incarnation 
                of God'. After compiling the Vedas, Srila Vyasadeva was inspired 
                by his spiritual master to present their profound essence in the 
                form of the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam </i>. Known as 'the ripened fruit 
                of the tree of Vedic literature', <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> is 
                the most complete and authoritative exposition of Vedic knowledge. 
                (Prabhupada, <i>Srimad</i> <i>Bhagavatam</i> , cover notes) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT> Hare Krsna devotees believe there are five, rather 
              than four, Vedas (the fifth being the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>). The 
              Vedas are <i>sruti </i> but the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> is <i>smrti</i>, 
              albeit the most important part. When the term 'Vedic literature' 
              is used by devotees it does not simply mean <i>sruti</i> but literature 
              from the early period which expresses authoritative 'knowledge' 
              about God. This includes the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and the rest of 
              the <i>Mahabharata</i>, the <i>Ramayana</i>, the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> 
              and the other <i>Puranas</i>. (It is possible that, by extension, 
              some devotees may also include texts such as Krsnadasa Kaviraja`s 
              <i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>). 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>It is important to stress several things here. First, 
              the Hare Krsna Movement is not alone in its understanding of Vedic 
              literature: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Like the Pancharatrins, Madhva, Chaitanya and other 
                Vaisnavas, Bhaktivedanta extended the authority of the word 'Vedic' 
                beyond the <i> Upanishads</i> so as to apply to the <i>Puranas</i>, 
                the <i>Mahabharata</i>, and the original <i>Ramayana</i> .The 
                influential Vaisnava philosopher, Madhva, taught that the ultimate 
                aim of all revealed and traditional texts was to testify to the 
                super-excellence of Vishnu as the supreme Lord . How natural then 
                for the Gaudiya Vaisnavas, who believe that Krsna is the Supreme 
                Personality of Godhead, to accept as equally revealed the words 
                of Krsna in the <i>Gita</i>, or of Chaitanya, his avatar. (Judah, 
                1974) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>A number of religious leaders and teachers have held 
              the <i>Puranas</i> to be the successor to the Vedas, even a fifth 
              Veda. Renou (1965) commented: 'It is also stated that these texts 
              are a means of access to the Veda, therefore, they are intermediaries, 
              if not intercessors'. While many of those outside the Vaisnava fold 
              would be unwilling to accept the <i>Puranas </i>in this way, it 
              is likely that even some <i>Advaita Vedantins</i> would see the 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> as <i>sruti</i>. Those who do not, however, 
              would certainly not deny its enormous importance, as illustrated 
              by Sankara and subsequent <i>Vedantin </i>philosophers. 
            <p align=LEFT>The second consideration , which is a reiteration of 
              an earlier point, is the concept of 'knowledge'. Veda means 'knowledge' 
              and thus Vedic literature is the source of knowledge about God, 
              the soul and spiritual life. For this reason, it is important that 
              the scriptures present a coherent picture. Commentators such as 
              Sankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Vishnuswami, Nimbarka and Chaitanya have 
              seen this picture in different ways, but as far as the Hare Krsna 
              devotees are concerned, Chaitanya's interpretation is the true one. 
              Chaitanya`s view was authoritative because of his incarnational 
              status and spiritual link in a chain of disciplic succession with 
              Vyasadeva and Krsna Himself (<i>parampara</i>). In addition. Chaitanya 
              and his followers present an interpretation which seeks to combine 
              all earlier positions (<i>acintya bhedabhedab - </i>identity-in-difference). 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The Hare Krsna Movement, which traces its ancestry 
              back through A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to Chaitanya, 
              sees this all-embracing account of Vedic literature (and the culture 
              and lifestyle described therein) as authoritative. The Vedas contain 
              knowledge of God and spiritual life, and knowledge has been passed 
              down from God through a succession of like-minded spiritual masters. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Having characterised the view of Vedic literature 
              held by both camps (in particular the less well-known one of the 
              Hare Krsna devotees), I shall briefly discuss the two broad issues 
              which arise when these views come together in encounter. These issues 
              relate not only to the scholarly encounter with Krsna Consciousness 
              but also with other Hindu groups. They also help to bring into focus 
              the way in which traditions operate, albeit devotional or scholarly. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Vedic literature: hermeneutical considerations </b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Chaudhuri (1979) suggests that the tradition of dating 
              the Vedas at 1500-1200 BC stems from the likelihood that even Western 
              scholars were unconsciously swayed by the fantastic chronology of 
              the Hindus but 'being incapable of swallowing that camel, selected 
              instead a smaller animal which would more easily go down their throats'. 
            <p align=LEFT>In understanding the two traditions of dating - scholarly 
              and devotional - we have to bear in mind the history of debate on 
              this and other related issues. Traditionally, Indians had a different 
              understanding of the operation of history. The events of the recent 
              past were seen as less important than that which could be learned 
              from stories about past <i>yugas</i>. European scholars, from a 
              religious and intellectual tradition with a deep and abiding concern 
              for linear history, took a different view. They were interested 
              in the content and teachings of the texts but were equally fascinated 
              by what the texts suggested about a people. Inevitably they wanted 
              to discover more about when this people lived, where they came from, 
              when the texts themselves were composed, etc. 
            <p

                             align=LEFT>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
              saw the first encounter of these two groups, the Indians and the 
              Europeans (particularly the British) with their differing orientations, 
              which led to the development of further perspectives on this issue. 
              As is well known, the British were unhappy about many 'Hindoo' practices 
              and their attitude led to a concern for social and religious reform 
              amongst Indians themselves. This concern, coupled with the European 
              scholarly interest in the Vedic age and its texts (perceived to 
              be the earliest known to man), led many religious leaders to look 
              back to this early period as a source of great spiritual teaching 
              (for example, Ram Mohan Roy's interest in the <i>Upanishads</i> 
              and, particularly, Dayananda Saraswati`s focus on the Vedic 'Golden 
              Age'). Contemporaneous with this Indian desire to 'look back' was 
              the European scholarly (particularly German idealist) reverence 
              for the Vedas which, in its own way, also glorified this early period. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>These complex attitudes and interests have been responsible 
              for encouraging and supporting different accounts of the dating 
              of Vedic literature and its contents. If we add to these the late 
              nineteenth century Bengali renaissance of Hindu devotionalism (exemplified 
              by Ramakrishna and the Gaudiya Vaisnava Mission [the parent of Krsna 
              Consciousness]), and the twentieth century scholarly interest in 
              texts and archaeology, we have a more complete picture of the sources 
              for understanding both views. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The Vedic age and its literature: a nineteenth century 
              invention?</b> 
            <p>It is tempting to assume, on the basis of the nineteenth century 
              encounter between India and the West and its subsequent products, 
              that the whole debate and the independent views its comprises, has 
              its source there. Furthermore, it is assumed that Indian interest 
              in the Vedas and other scriptures, and its reverence for the Vedic 
              way of life only developed as a result of this coming together of 
              East and West, as did that of scholars. 
            <p align=LEFT>While the latter point is clearly true, the former is 
              more complex. It is not simply the case that the Hare Krsna Movement's 
              interest in Vedic literature and culture, and its perception of 
              the origins of the texts themselves, are a function of nineteenth 
              century developments. As we have seen, within the Hare Krsna movement 
              there is a concern with authority and, it could even be said, with 
              a linear understanding of spiritual succession from Chaitanya and 
              Krsna Himself. Like the Arya Samaj, the nineteenth Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              Mission saw the Vedic period as ideal and viewed certain scriptures 
              as important for spiritual guidance. Contrary to the Arya Samaj, 
              however, this movement did not seek to legitimise itself solely 
              in terms of the authority it gave to Vedic literature, but was also 
              concerned to stress its own historical continuity with the period 
              of those texts. Furthermore, while the Arya Samaj revered the Vedas 
              and dismissed lattr literature as idolatrous, the Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              Mission (and, in its wake, the Hare Krsna Movement) was more interested 
              in texts which stressed <i>bhakti</i> , which it saw as Vedic in 
              type. 
            <p align=LEFT>Typical of most Vaisnava sects, the Gaudiya Vaisnava 
              Mission and the Hare Krsna Movement have both made a point of stressing 
              Vedic links. They do not accept the scholarly view that the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              and <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> were composed significantly later than 
              the Vedas. Instead, the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> is seen as broadly 
              contemporaneous with the Vedic <i>Samhitas</i> and <i> Upanisads</i> 
              but of greater significance in terms of its contribution to spiritual 
              knowledge (as opposed to ritual practice or philosophical speculation), 
              the <i>Bhagavad Purana</i> being the original commentary explaining 
              and building on these <i>sruti </i>texts. 
            <p align=LEFT>The Gaudiya Vaisnava Mission and the Hare Krsna Movement 
              are not simply being perverse in this matter - there is a long history 
              of this view. As we have already seen, Madhava and Chaitanya saw 
              the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> as part 
              of the original teachings of Krsna. Furthermore, as representatives 
              of the Vaisnava <i>sampradaya</i>, they are part of a tradition 
              (<i>vedanta</i>) which also stresses its links with the Vedas. Scholars 
              always cite Ramanuja as having legitimised early Vaishnavism, referring 
              not only to the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> but also to the Upanisads and 
              <i>Vedanta Sutra</i>. Madhava, Visnusvami and Nimbarka carried on 
              this tradition. As Renou (1965) comments in his account of the Vedas 
              in India's past: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Like the Shaivities, the Vaisnavities of Vedantin 
                obedience remain attached to theVeda, even when they are influenced 
                by <i>bhakti</i> (an a-Vedic phenomenon, if ever there was one). 
                Vedanta is the rallying point of Vedic tendencies, and one is 
                faithful to the Veda to the extent that one is Vedantin. 
            </ul>
            <p>The important point here is that these Vaisnava movements are not 
              simply legitimising their own texts on the strength of the fame 
              of the earlier texts, they believe that these texts are one, that 
              they all incorporate to a greater or lesser extent the same basic 
              teachings. The Indian scholar Srivatsa Goswami, himself a Vaisnava 
              in the Chaitanya tradition, says: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The earliest written documents of Indian religious 
                history are the Vedas, which may be the earliest religious writings 
                in the entire world. It is said, '<i>Veda-mula jagad sarvam </i>- 
                Veda is the root of the whole universe. That means that all concepts 
                are present, at least in seed form, in the Vedas. We don't claim 
                that there is a well-defined Vaisnava system in the Veda, but 
                the root is there. In the Vedas we find gods and people devoted 
                to gods, and that is <i>bhakti</i> ... . 
              <p align=LEFT>The concept of <i>bhakti </i>has taken shape in the 
                Vedas. There are numerous textual evidences for this. This means 
                that even before the time of the Vedas, some form of <i>bhakti</i> 
                was present, of which the Vedas are a document ... 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Furthermore, in <i>Hare Krsna and the Counterculture</i>, 
              Steven Gelberg noted: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The point is that <i>bhakti</i> is an eternal human 
                tendency; it is not merely some kind of historical movement arising 
                out of peculiar social and cultural circumstances ... 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The Vedas themselves are therefore seen as containing 
              the same teaching as the more obvious Vaisnava texts, although the 
              teachings are more thoroughly expounded in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              and <i> Bhagavata Purana</i>. It seems probable, and this is illustrated 
              by the 'commentary tradition', that this view was shared by Vaisnava 
              philosophers and teachers in the medieval period and nineteenth 
              and twentieth centuries. 
            <p align=LEFT>From a Western scholarly point of view, there is a tendency 
              to feel (as Renou revealed in his comments on <i>bhakti</i>) that 
              the teachings expounded in these texts are far from compatible, 
              and an equally strong tendency to see those who feel differently 
              as unorthodox - 'swimming against the tide'. In part, this may be 
              because from the standpoint of our own intellectual and cultural 
              tradition, the seemingly a-historical and inclusivist (or syncretist) 
              interpretation put forward by Vaisnavas, is unusual, foreign and, 
              undoubtedly, wrong. For most scholars - and this is only my opinion 
              - the question of the Vaisnava view of the dating and parameters 
              of Vedic literature requires a phenomenological leap which is almost 
              impossible to take. We have come to believe, almost as firmly as 
              most Vaisnavas, in the accuracy of a particular view of both the 
              approximate dating of Sanskrit texts and in the reference and use 
              of terms such as Vedic and <i>sruti</i>. Behind both the devotional 
              and scholarly views, are intellectual and cultural traditions: the 
              problem is that one, the scholarly, aims to understand and present 
              the other, the devotional., objectively and empathically simultaneously. 
              This is difficult when that which is to be understood and presented 
              rests on ways of thinking about things which differ radically from 
              those underpinning the scholarly tradition itself. For example, 
              the contemporary Western study of history, the concept of evolutionary 
              intellectual development, etc.
