            <p></p>
            <p>I went to a Catholic school, where we were not taught about other 
              religions on the grounds that it would be a waste of time as they 
              were self-evidently false. In those days - prior to the Second Vatican 
              Council - Catholicism taught not just that Jesus was the only way 
              to God, but that the Roman Catholic Church was the only way to Jesus. 
              This seemed immensely unfair to all the people who had never heard 
              of Jesus, and disrespectful to the millions who faithfully followed 
              the respective religions of their births. I felt it could not represent 
              the true teachings of Jesus and I could not wholeheartedly give 
              myself to such a religious path which excluded so many. I wanted 
              to share my religion with the universe. If there was an absolute 
              truth it had to be universally accessible and not bound to any one 
              culture. My God could speak to anyone, anywhere, at any time. </p>
            <p align=LEFT> When, at age nineteen, I first read the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              (in a translation by Christopher Isherwood), I was deeply moved. 
              Here was a book which obviously contained divine truth. The voice 
              which spoke to me through those pages was the same voice which I 
              heard through the Gospels. Yet here, the universality which I sensed 
              in the teachings of Christ was woven into every page of the text. 
              Like others before me, I discovered that the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              was broad and deep enough to encompass the full range of human religious 
              experience. Here was God speaking to me from outside the Christian, 
              and indeed any man-made, tradition.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>It was at this time that I received my first audience 
              with Srila Prabhupada, during a late night chat show on BBC TV called 
              <i>Late Night Line Up</i>, which had a reputation for being well-informed 
              and up-to-the-minute. Tony Bilbow, the presenter, would only interview 
              the most interesting people, and he had a way of putting them on 
              the spot. In the hot seat that evening was a venerable and kindly-looking 
              Indian guru, and I sat glued to the screen. The guru looked and 
              sounded like a genuine spiritual teacher - if anyone could tell 
              me about religion, he could. Bilbow asked Prabhupada what his teaching 
              was, to which Prabhupada promptly replied, 'how to love God. Bilbow 
              appeared to be thrown slightly off-balance by this direct answer 
              (especially on a programme where the word 'God' was rarely mentioned), 
              but he pressed on. 'Which God is this you are talking about - is 
              it the same as the Christian God?' What would the answer be, I wondered. 
              Could this man, clearly not a Christian, be worshipping the same 
              God as me? Whatever his answer, there could be no doubt that he 
              knew God - I could see it in his face. 'Of course I am speaking 
              of the same God,' came Prabhupada's answer, with a knowing smile, 
              and to prove it he sat down on the floor of the studio to chant 
              'Hare Krsna' with his disciples. The divine sound of Krsna's names 
              left me in no doubt that Prabhupada spoke the truth. Again, that 
              same message! There were other ways to the one universal God. I 
              felt exhilarated.</p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Krsna's words</b></p>
            <p align=LEFT> In the months that followed I acquired a copy of Srila 
              Prabhupada's <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> translation and commentary. As 
              I studied it, I became more and more convinced that this was a truly 
              universal scripture. </p>
            <p

                             align=LEFT>Throughout the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> Krsna 
              endorses all religion as part of the search for truth. In the seventeenth 
              chapter He explains the types of faith appropriate to different 
              persons. He supports the aspirations of each individual by steadying 
              their faith so that they could devote themselves to their chosen 
              deity (7.21). Furthermore, He warns against disturbing others on 
              their path (3.26) because, ultimately, all beings were on Krsna's 
              path and received their rewards from Him (4.11): 'Whenever and wherever 
              there is a decline in religious practice, O son of Bharata, and 
              a predominant rise in irreligion - at that time I descend Myself.' 
              (4.7). </p>
            <p align=LEFT>With this famous statement Krsna swept aside all sectarian 
              claims to monopoly on the truth. Prabhupada's commentary on this 
              verse was also significant: 'It is not a fact that the Lord appears 
              only on Indian soil.' Is Prabhupada actually referring to incarnations 
              on this earth other than Krsna and the avatars of Vishnu? Have there 
              been avatars appearing in other lands and giving teachings known 
              by other names? Prabhupada continues: 'Sometimes He descends personally, 
              and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form 
              of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.' Prabhupada's 
              meaning is clear: we are not to think that Krsna and Lord Caitanya 
              are the only avatars of God to have taught the people of this world, 
              or that the Vaisnava tradition is the only true religious teaching.</p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Spiritual evolution</b></p>
            <p

                             align=LEFT>For me, the most persuasive argument of 
              all was Krsna's assertion that the path to true knowledge is one 
              that spans many lifetimes. This implies there are successive stages 
              of spiritual development which a soul must pass through, and that 
              these stages may be spread over a considerable period of time. It 
              seems obvious therefore, that different religious paths and different 
              phases within those paths, represent steps on the ladder of spiritual 
              progress. It is reasonable to assume therefore, that the soul progressing 
              through these levels will take repeated births within the same religious 
              environment to further develop along the chosen path. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>In the evolution of Western religious thought, I see 
              a corresponding pattern of spiritual development: from the rigid 
              hierarchical religion of medieval Europe (with its widespread corruption), 
              to the liberalisation brought about by Protestantism together with 
              a return to the basics of <i>The Bible</i>; from contact with other 
              religious traditions (often by missionaries), to the influence of 
              Eastern ideas and the gradual breaking down of rigid sectarian thinking 
              (with the corresponding widening of religious horizons in the twentieth 
              century). I interpret this as the spiritual evolution of the Western 
              human family, themselves part of the whole human family, who in 
              turn are part of the family of all life on earth. The coming of 
              Krsna Consciousness to the West is, for me, a continuing part of 
              this process, one for which we, and the rest of our earthly family, 
              have been preparing ourselves over many lifetimes.</p>
            <p>If there is any truth to this concept it would also make sense 
              that we have all benefitted by the teachings of Christ and other 
              religions at some time in our existence, if not in the present incarnation, 
              and that these are ultimately all part of a single process of spiritual 
              evolution.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>It is interesting to note that, since the days of my 
              school education, the official doctrine of the Catholic Church has 
              evolved. It now teaches that Christ is to be found in all religions. 
              In other words, if I am a good Hindu, I may also eventually find 
              Christ through following the <i> Bhagavad-gita</i>. This is a great 
              step forward, and one that closely parallels the words Srila Prabhupada 
              often spoke about followers of other religions. His view was that 
              whoever honestly and sincerely followed the religion of their birth 
              would find God.</p>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Srila Prabhupada's open hand</b></p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada often spoke of the oneness of religion. He said 
              that he had not come to convert Christians into Hindus, but to encourage 
              them to properly follow their own religion. In 1971, during a meeting 
              with a Christian nun at the Bury Place temple in London, Prabhupada 
              told her, 'Don't think (Krsna Consciousness) is against Christianity 
              or it is sectarian. Let us co-operate fully. Jointly, let us preach 
              all over the world, "Chant the holy name of God" ... We don't say 
              that you chant Hare Krsna. If you have got name of God, you chant 
              it.' Some may protest that such words, with their broad inclusiveness, 
              are untypical of Srila Prabhupada and must be balanced against other, 
              quite different passages in Prabhupada's writings. However, Prabhupada 
              frequently expressed this sentiment when the context was appropriate.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>For example, in 1961, several years before leaving India 
              for the West, Prabhupada was invited to participate in the <i>Congress 
              for Cultivating Human Spirit</i>, an international religious conference 
              on world peace to be held in Tokyo. Sadly, Srila Prabhupada was 
              unable to attend as no one was prepared to pay his fare but we still 
              have <i>Light of the Bhagavata</i>, which he wrote especially for 
              the occasion. In it he included the following remarkable passage: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>In this age of a godless civilisation, the sages of world-recognised 
                religious sects who believe in God, must come out of their secluded 
                places and preach the science of God to the people in general. 
                Hindus, Muslims and Christians and members of other sects that 
                have convincing faith in the authority of God, must not sit idly 
                now and silently watch the rapid growth of a godless civilisation 
                . Responsible leaders of religious sects must meet together and 
                form a common platform of a league of devotees of the Lord. </p>
            </ul>
            <p>Here Srila Prabhupada talks of Hindus, Muslims, Christians and 
              others, as if they all possess equally valid faith in God, and he 
              calls upon the sages from among them to join together. 'Sage' is 
              a significant word and not one Prabhupada would use lightly. Clearly, 
              Prabhupada acknowledges that God is to be found in many religious 
              traditions and that these traditions have their own spiritually 
              advanced souls. To many readers this may seem obvious, but it is 
              worth noting that Srila Prabhupada himself believed this to be true.</p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Prabhupada asks these sages to come out from their 
              secluded places and give to the world their knowledge and understanding 
              in these times of great need; to 'meet together and form a common 
              platform of a league of devotees'. Where have we heard this phrase 
              'league of devotees' before? In 1952, Srila Prabhupada launched 
              a League of Devotees in Jhansi, India, aimed at 'all nations, creeds 
              and castes'. At that time the experiment was short-lived, but he 
              continued to pursue the idea; nine years later, he chanced upon 
              the opportunity to participate in a major international spiritual 
              congress. Still thinking of his League of Devotees, he used this 
              term to describe his vision of religious unity. It is inconceivable 
              that Prabhupada could have employed so cherished a phrase accidentally, 
              and it must have been a conscious reference to his own dream of 
              a group of devotees dedicated to living and teaching Love of God.</p>
            <p><b>Inner and outer lives</b></p>
            <p>These broad sentiments of Prabhupada's were normally spoken to 
              members of other faiths, in public lectures etc., and were not aimed 
              solely at his own close followers. In this way Prabhupada set the 
              example for discrimination when preaching - a true essential quality 
              of truth. </p>
            <p align=LEFT>Sages, Prabhupada says, have their 'secluded places'. 
              That is to say, they have their own ashrams, monasteries, mosques 
              or other places of spiritual shelter, where they pursue their particular 
              devotions to the Supreme Lord. We all need the spiritual security 
              of such places, where we are free to be with our god-brothers, god-sisters 
              and our personal spiritual guides, in a deep community of the heart. 
              It is through such loving associations (<i>sadhu sanga</i>) that 
              we gain strength and inner nurture; where we hear and speak directly 
              of Krsna's beauty, mercy, wisdom and loving pastimes with His devotees. 
              In this way we deepen our love for Him and for each other.</p>
            <p>When we leave our 'secluded places' to go into the world - to teach, 
              to support our families,or simply to follow the call of the spirit 
              - we have to behave differently. In this outer life, when we interact 
              with Krsna's created world and the innumerable individual souls 
              within it there are still many spiritual truths which we can share 
              with others, but we must do so with wisdom and sensitivity. These 
              truths may be of a different kind to those we share with Krsna's 
              devotees, yet they can still be rare and special in today's materialistic 
              world. At such times a teacher speaks to the heart of the listener, 
              not by simply repeating a rigid formula but being alive to the voice 
              of Krsna's inspiration and hearing its echo in the heart of the 
              sincere hearer.</p>
            <p>Through such sharing we may be fortunate to meet members of other 
              faiths who are 'sages' with firm faith in God, and who may have 
              something to teach us. We should not think that because we know 
              about Krsna's personal form, and they do not, we have nothing to 
              learn from them.</p>
            <p><b>Always be a learner</b></p>
            <p>The sign of a spiritually developed person is one who is constantly 
              learning from everyone and everything - never deaf to the voice 
              of Krsna from wherever or through whomever He may choose to speak. 
              For example, I have a Christian friend who regularly prays to Jesus, 
              studies Christian writings and worships with other Christians. Yet 
              he has the highest regard for devotees of Krsna and is always open 
              to hear from them - a mark of true spiritual development. However, 
              those whose religious commitment excludes the possibility of learning 
              from those on other spiritual paths and who are unable to appreciate 
              devotees of Krsna, are clearly not on such an elevated platform. 
              These people should be respected but it is preferable, for them 
              and for us, not to associate with them. However, we should be generous 
              in our dealings with those individuals who have firm faith in God 
              (even though they may not know Him as Krsna) and who are loving 
              and open towards others, because many of them can, and do, help, 
              and may increasingly take help from, us.</p>

                             align=LEFT><b>Changing ISKCON</b></p>
            <p>I find it immensely sad that ISKCON has, in many circles, gained 
              a reputation for being a type of fundamentalist Hinduism always 
              on the lookout for converts and self-advancement; whose members 
              are too busy putting their own point of view to hear what others 
              have to say. I do not believe this is what Prabhupada wanted nor 
              do I believe it is what we originally chose. Many devotees, like 
              me, came to Krsna Consciousness because it embodied the universal 
              principle of Love of God in a way that embraced, not excluded, other 
              religions. Unfortunately many devotees have forgotten, or do not 
              recognise, the difference between being in our own 'secluded place', 
              where we can talk exclusively of Krsna, and being on the wider stage 
              where Prabhupada is calling all believers in God to unite in a league 
              of devotees. In the face of the 'rapid growth of a godless civilisation', 
              how many brothers and sisters would answer such a call if it was 
              put to them in the right way?</p>
            <p>A few years ago I participated in the Festival of Faith and the 
              Environment which drew together members of all religions at one 
              of England's great places of worship, Canterbury Cathedral. As one 
              of the organisers, I led a multi faith group of pilgrims, about 
              half of whom were devotees of Krsna, on a six-day walk from Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor to Canterbury.</p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>One Christian member of our pilgrimage group, Gerry 
              Jennings, had come from America with her daughter and was meeting 
              ISKCON devotees for the first time. At the end of our eight days 
              together I asked her what she felt about us. 'I found the devotees 
              very peaceful and warm,' she told me, 'And I learned a lot from 
              them. However, if I were to give any advice, it would be that they 
              should listen to people as well as preach to them. Everyone's enthusiastic 
              about the things they believe in, but they have to realise that 
              the person on the other side of the conversation is likewise enthusiastic 
              about what they want to say. If people of any faith can sit and 
              listen as well as talk, then we are all going to gain this concept 
              of one God earlier than otherwise.'</p>
            <p>I have learned from Gerry's well-meaning advice. The mood of appreciation 
              which she describes does not prevent others from receiving Krsna 
              consciousness from me. In fact it allows them to be more receptive 
              and, equally importantly, it allows me to grow in my own understanding 
              of Krsna and His divine mercy.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>My hope is that as devotees find the courage, wisdom 
              and love to open themselves to the world in a spirit of humility 
              and trust, the nature of ISKCON will change. Without compromising 
              our inner life, we may discover that we do indeed belong to a 'universal 
              league of devotees'.</p>
