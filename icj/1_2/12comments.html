            <p></p>
            <p>The following report is edited from a message that Priyavrata Dasa, 
              the International Food for Life Co-ordinator, submitted to the European 
              Communications Europe (ICE) and Food for Life COM conferences on 
              15 October, 1993. </p>
            <p>Priyavrata had visited Sukhumi, Georgia (CIS) earlier this year 
              as part of his mission to inspire and enthuse devotees who have 
              volunteered their services to the worldwide Food for Life programme. 
              On his arrival in Sukhumi, Priyavrata was shocked to find himself 
              in the middle of a war zone, with devotees risking their lives every 
              day to feed thousands of people who were dependent on the food provided 
              by the programme.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>A civil war was being waged between the Georgian army 
              and the Abkhazian rebels. However, Mayuradvaja Dasa and Yamaraja 
              Dasa - the former from Georgia, the latter Abkhazia - chose to ignore 
              to sectarian call to arms and instead decided to work together to 
              feed <i>prasadam</i> (sanctified food) to all who were in need, 
              thus starting the Food for Life programme.</p>
            <p>A large percentage of the food was donated by other ISKCON temples 
              in the CIS, although the Red Cross and the Georgian army also giving 
              supplies. In addition, the army provided all the cooking equipment.</p>
            <p>Early in October 1993, the Abkhazian rebels broke a fragile truce, 
              attacking and overwhelming the city of Sukhumi. As a result, all 
              contact was lost with the devotees there and ISKCON feared for their 
              safety. Priyavrata's report was the first to come out of the fallen 
              city.</p>

            <p><b>Sender: FFL (Food for Life)&lt;112&gt; <br>
              </b><b> Receiver: ICE (ISKCON Communications Europe)<br>
              </b><b>Subject: FFL news from Sukhumi</b></p>
            <p>SUKHUMI, 24 September. After the Abhazians had broken the truce 
              and taken over the city, the situated looked critical for the local 
              devotees. Fighting got as close as the same street in which the 
              devotees were living and they couldn't go anywhere without the risk 
              of being shot. The Abkhazians had captured the boat carrying all 
              the food supplies, forcing the stoppage of the programme for the 
              first time in twelve months.</p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>However, Mayuradvaja Dasa, its director, was determined 
              not to give in. He still tried to secure food , fearlessly driving 
              round the city even though soldiers frequently shot at his car. 
              Having just returned from undergoing heart surgery in Moscow, Mayuradvaja 
              had been specifically told to relax and avoid stressful situations 
              by his doctors. However, Mayuradvaja chose to ignore this advice, 
              wanting only to save people from starvation even at the risk of 
              his own life.</p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Mayurdvaja then heard that Raghava Pandita Dasa, 
              who had been organising the Food for Life programme in Gudauta (another 
              rebel stronghold), had received a shipment of food previously destined 
              for Sukhumi but stolen by the rebels from another devotee, Parjanya 
              Dasa. However, the soldiers had appreciated Raghava's efforts to 
              save the local Abkhazian people and had subsequently handed over 
              the food to him.</p>
            <p>However, Food for Life in Sukhumi was still without food after 
              five days, resulting in the deaths of many starving elderly people. 
              Meanwhile, the Abkhazian soldiers continued to attack the city, 
              killing every Georgian in sight. Fortunately, most of the Sukhumi 
              devotees were Russian by birth, which meant they were a little safer: 
              however, some still decided to leave. Mayuradvaja encouraged those 
              who remained by explaining that Krsna would take care of them.</p>
            <p>He was proved right; the solders purposely avoided shooting at 
              the devotees or at their temple, although many houses in the same 
              street were destroyed by shell fire. The devotees remained inside 
              the temple and chanted, while Sikhamani Dasa continued his worship 
              of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai. Bullets criss-crossed the sky as angry Abkhazian 
              soldiers reclaimed Sukhumi. No-one was able to leave or enter the 
              city: three Aeroflot planes were shot down, killing hundreds of 
              people; another was blown up as it prepared to leave the airport, 
              carrying two hundred fleeing Georgia citizens.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>Eventually the fighting ceased. Raghava Pandita, together 
              with his Food for Life team, arrived from Gudauta and immediately 
              began arranging food distribution. Once more the Sukhumi devotees 
              could get back to work; solders even began coming to the temple 
              to take <i>prasadam</i>. Before it had been the Georgian solders, 
              now it was the native Abkhazians. It seemed the soldiers were unconsciously 
              aware that the devotees were unconcerned about the politics and 
              nationalism that had started the war. They were not on anyone's 
              side - they were simply there to help. </p>
            <p>In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, a television news reporter observed 
              that everyone and everything in the city of Sukhumi was being shot 
              at except a group of brahmans who were feeding the people.</p>
            <p align=LEFT> <b>2 October</b></p>
            <p>Mayuradvaja eventually had to leave Sukhumi to organise a Food 
              for Life programme in Tbilisi, where many of the Georgian citizens 
              from Sukhumi had fled. However, the city and countryside were still 
              under blockade, with checkpoints at all the exit routes - getting 
              out would be dangerous. Mayuradvaja decided to attempt something 
              even the Georgian soldiers had not dared to try - driving cross-country.</p>
            <p align=JUSTIFY> Together with three other devotees, Mayuradvaja 
              drove out of the city in the temple's small grey lada. They passed 
              through several checkpoints, finally arriving at the last one on 
              the border separating Abkhazia from Georgia. The devotees knew that 
              if the border guards checking the cars discovered three of them 
              were Georgian (including Mayuradvaja himself), they would be shot 
              on the spot. However, they joined the line of waiting cars. After 
              some time, Mayuradvaja decided they should keep moving; he got out 
              of the car and walked to the front to speak with the Abkhazian soldiers 
              about the Food for Life mission. One of the soldiers recognised 
              him from Sukhumi; another had heard about the programme. They told 
              Mayuradvaja to return to his car and drive to the front. Bypassing 
              the long line of cars, the devotees passed through the border without 
              inspection. Krsna had protected them again.</p>
            <p>Mayuradvaja has arranged for food supplies to be sent to Tbilisi, 
              where thousands of Georgian citizens are struggling to survive. 
              The United Nations and the Red Cross are meeting to discuss plans 
              for feeding the Georgian refugees. The United Nations' local representative, 
              Pierre Urloffe, had visited Sukhumi earlier in the year and witnessed, 
              with tears in his eyes, the devotees' Food for Life programme. In 
              a subsequent report to the United Nations Headquarters, he stated 
              how the Hare Krsna movement was saving the lives of thousands.</p>
            <p align=LEFT>Mayuradvaja wants to return to Sukhumi, despite the 
              danger. 'I have a taste,' he explains. 'I want to help these people. 
              Someone has to do it, and it may as well be us. There is nothing 
              more beneficial than Krsna <i>prasadam</i>, food offered first to 
              God. This is the real welfare work - we're saving people's souls.'</p>
            <p><i>Majuradvaja has now taken up directorship of the Moscow Food 
              for Life programme, from where he plans to direct activities all 
              over the CIS.</i></p>
