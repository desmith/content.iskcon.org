            <p><i>This article provides a comprehensive overview and analysis 

              of Rasamandala's systematic approach to education and in reaching 

              his significant audience.</i></p>

            <p>In my last article I outlined the main achievements of ISKCON Educational 

              Services (IES) in working with schools in the UK. I'd now like to 

              further examine our methodology and to analyse the programme in 

              terms of modern communications philosophy, with particular reference 

              to research undertaken by Mukunda Maharaja. Through this exploration 

              of the potential benefits of interaction with schools, I hope devotees 

              worldwide will be encouraged to start or develop similar projects. 

              In conclusion, I'll share with you some of my ideas about the future 

              of the schools programme and how it may contribute towards the diversification 

              of book distribution.</p>

            <h5><b>Our Experience in the UK</b></h5>

            <p>We started to develop our schools programme in the UK approximately 

              three years ago. Although then unacquainted with the communications 

              theory, IES enjoyed initial successes. It may be expedient to explore 

              some of the principles we adopted, often by chance, though in the 

              light of knowledge and terminology recently acquired from communications 

              seminars, etc. I have analysed three important principles:</p>

            <p><b><i>Customer Care</i></b></p>

            <p align=LEFT>This principle entails knowing, acknowledging and satisfying 

              the needs, interests and concerns of our 'customers' (or in communications 

              terms, our 'target public'). In the UK, this has been reflected 

              by attention to service quality: as stated by a member of the IES 

              staff in a recent article in the <i>Guardian Education Supplement</i>: 

              'We try to provide what teachers want'. Though printed publicity 

              material is invaluable - and we've produced a lot - our experience 

              has been that the best advertising is through word of mouth. A well-earned 

              reputation is far more valuable and satisfying than a glossy but 

              superficial image. </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Other practical demonstrations of our commitment 

              to quality have been: </p>

            <ul type="DISC">

              <li> 

                <p>Showing consistency and accessibility</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Giving prompt attention to enquiries</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Establishing a database of all contacts</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Keeping teachers informed of the services we offer </p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Taking the trouble to learn about religious education and its 

                  often complicated jargon</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Being flexible and open to new ideas, especially from educationalists 

                  themselves</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Going beyond the call of duty; for example, fitting in engagements 

                  at a moment's notice when a school has been let down by someone 

                  else (this is an excellent way to win friends!)</p>

              </li>

            </ul>

            <p>However, I've noticed a perhaps understandable reluctance from 

              some devotees to heartily adopt the principles of customer care. 

              Our tradition is one of descending knowledge where power of decision 

              lies proportionately with those of greater purity and discrimination. 

              Being entrusted, to different degrees, with the weighty responsibility 

              of delivering unchanged the message of the <i>parampara</i>, we 

              are often loathe to listen to advice from possibly 'impure' sources. 

              Though we wish to embrace as wide and diverse a public as possible, 

              we are also concerned to preserve the purity of ISKCON. I'd suggest, 

              however, that listening and taking note of the needs, interests, 

              concerns, opinions and feelings of those we consider spiritually 

              'our junior' neither undermines our benign hierarchical system nor 

              our position in it. Rather, it empowers members, and particularly 

              leaders, to make charitable decisions based on greater knowledge. 

              Furthermore, the ability to listen without being unnecessarily swayed 

              is a symptom of genuine purity and discrimination. Nevertheless, 

              it requires a degree of self-knowledge and a clear awareness of 

              our identity, purpose and boundaries. </p>

            <p><i><b>Defining and Pursuing Clear Aims and Objectives</b></i></p>

            <p>Customer care may be qualified with the following statement: 'We 

              can satisfy the needs, concerns and interests of our public only 

              in so much as they are consistent with, or contribute towards, our 

              own aims and objectives.' </p>

            <p>What are ISKCON's aims and objectives and how does the schools 

              programme fit in with these? How can we link our own interests to 

              those of educationalists? What is the relationship between preaching 

              and teaching, the confessional and the professional? </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>It may be expedient to note that the word 'preach' 

              usually has negative connotations with our public, although it is 

              considered a 'buzz word' within ISKCON. However, I don't see this 

              a stumbling block in relating our aims to those of the public as 

              fortunately there is no exclusive theology at the base of our tradition. 

              Our preaching activities are not directed towards conversion from 

              one faith to another; rather we wish to encourage spiritual values 

              that are common to all and embodied by diverse religious traditions. 

              This goes a long way in validating ISKCON's 'missionary' aims in 

              the eyes of educationalists.</p>

            <p

                             align=LEFT>Another significant point is that provision 

              of information (i.e. teaching) is the basis of developing the understanding 

              necessary for empathy (which is the purpose of preaching). The Rowland 

              Company, a public relations group, endorsed this in a presentation 

              to the GBC on 31 May 1991: 'Information begets knowledge which begets 

              understanding'. Good preaching does not require coercion; respecting 

              the integrity of the person and his or her ability to make meaningful 

              decisions based on the information we provide, is part of our heritage. 

              This is corroborated by Lord Krsna in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (18.63): 

              'Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential. 

              Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do.' Srila 

              Prabhupada further elaborates this point in his purport: 'Before 

              surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as 

              the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instructions 

              of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Is commitment inconsequential in teaching children 

              about different religions or does it disturb the objectivity of 

              the teaching process? Quite the contrary. In our experience, teachers 

              appear to value the contribution of faith members, not just because 

              of their extensive knowledge of their own tradition but because 

              commitment is important in the teaching process. Real commitment 

              is symptomised not by proselytising, but in respect for the integrity 

              and faith allegiance of the individual.</p>

            <p>It has been established that the aim of the schools programme is 

              not to 'recruit' but to favourably influence public opinion of the 

              moral and philosophical integrity of ISKCON. In order to achieve 

              this aim, the Society needs to value its heritage and what it can 

              offer to its various publics, not just in terms of nebulous transcendental 

              aspirations but in concrete, practical services. In the UK, the 

              IES knows it can offer a first-class service to schools, though 

              is constantly aware of where it needs to improve. On this basis 

              I am enthusiastic and confident that we can achieve our goals: to 

              be the leading educational authority on the Vedic Hindu tradition 

              and to make a substantial and valuable contribution to ISKCON and 

              society.</p>

            <p><b><i>Establishing Genuine, Sustainable Relationships</i></b></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Effecting changes in society requires positive interaction with 

              its members. I believe the ability to establish and sustain relationships 

              based on genuine appreciation is central to the development of the 

              Krsna consciousness movement. </p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>This third principle is consistent 

              with the idea of making a 'customer' rather than a 'sale' (or in 

              our terms, making a 'friend' rather than a 'programme'). For me, 

              this means trying to interact closely with those who are not devotees 

              without being judgemental and thinking 'I'm only here to preach 

              to them .'. I try to appreciate that many non-devotees have an empathy 

              for the principles upon which our Society is founded, and to feel 

              that we can be of service by offering solutions to their problems.</p>

            <h5><b>Modern Communications Theory</b></h5>

            <p>Modern communications has surpassed the cosmetic type of public 

              relations. It's no longer about projecting a false and non-sustainable 

              image, but establishing a fine reputation based on reality. Mukunda 

              Maharaja goes even further: 'Excellent communications in today's 

              world seeks not just to change an organisation's reputation, but 

              to change society<i>.</i>'<i> (ISKCON Communications Briefing May/June 

              1992</i>). He continues: 'The application of tested communications 

              methods for changing the way people behave towards ISKCON, involves 

              employing an established system of planning in which one decides 

              what target publics (social groupings) we want to speak to, what 

              messages we want to speak to each public and how we want to communicate 

              those messages.' </p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>There are three basic stages here on 

              which I will enlarge, though I will largely concentrate on the first 

              two. I'll begin by identifying our publics.</p>

            <p><b><i>Defining our Schools Public</i></b></p>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Pupils</i></p>

            <p>. In the UK this encompasses all children between four and eighteen 

              years of age. For them, religious education is compulsory and includes 

              the study of the principal world religions (usually represented 

              by Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism). 

            </p>

            <p>Notable features of this public are:</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>a) It encompasses almost a whole generation (except 

              perhaps children who are home-tutored) and necessarily includes 

              future prime ministers, archbishops, academics, journalists, press 

              editors, police chiefs, multi-millionaires and spiritual aspirants); 

            </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>b) It's substantial. In the UK there are 9.16 million 

              school children comprising 16.27% (or nearly one-sixth) of the population; 

            </p>

            <p>c) Its members are at an age when they're particularly receptive 

              to new ideas and information, with their prejudices and misconceptions 

              not so deeply rooted.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY><i>Teachers. </i></p>

            <p>Since teachers organise engagements and are highly influential 

              with our previous public, it's essential to firmly establish ISKCON's 

              reputation with them. We must keep this in mind when making presentations 

              to school audiences where teachers are usually present. </p>

            <p>When analysing teachers as a public, we've noted the following 

              characteristics:</p>

            <p>a) In the UK alone, there are over half a million teachers (approximately 

              0.95% of the total population); </p>

            <p>b) Of these, some will have particular responsibility for religious 

              education (RE). I have no exact figures, but in the UK there are 

              approximately seven thousand secondary schools, each with at least 

              one teacher specialising in this subject. These teachers are often 

              involved with religious education because of a personal, as well 

              as professional, interest. We should obviously avoid over-generalisation 

              but there are many amongst them who will appreciate and respect 

              our commitment to spiritual values. In primary schools the staff 

              teach all subjects to their year groups but at least fifty per cent 

              of these schools will have RE co-ordinators; </p>

            <p>c) Teachers represent the largest brahminically-inclined social 

              grouping in the UK and this possibly applies to other countries 

              as well. They are therefore an extremely influential public. </p>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Teacher trainees</i></p>

            <p align=LEFT>As the members of this particular public are future 

              teachers, establishing relationships from the beginning of their 

              careers is naturally advantageous. This is especially important 

              in moulding their perspectives on the Vedic tradition - which is 

              often significantly misunderstood and misrepresented though largely 

              not through any fault of teachers themselves.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY><i>Teacher trainers. </i>This public is connected 

              with the previous one. By establishing our reputation as a genuine 

              authority on the Vedic/Hindu tradition we will often be invited 

              to make presentations to trainees.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY><i>Religious education advisers. </i>This public 

              is particular to the UK, although it is assumed they have counterparts 

              in other countries. There are perhaps two hundred who advise and 

              support RE teachers regionally. Their support is instrumental in 

              establishing our reputation as they encourage RE teachers to interact 

              with faith communities and specifically recommend those they believe 

              are most suitable.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY><i>Academics connected with Religious Studies and 

              Religious Education. </i>The direction that RE takes in schools 

              and the schools' perception of individual religions, is largely 

              moulded by academics specialising in religious studies. Contact 

              with this public is extremely important bearing in mind the discrepancies 

              between our tradition and how it is often perceived and portrayed, 

              particularly in school textbooks.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>These are some of the main social groupings. There 

              are others, including government executives dealing with religious 

              education and educational officers for other faiths. Parents are 

              another important factor. In the UK, they frequently accompany school 

              trips to temples. In addition, they are a significant 'second-hand' 

              public. For example, if Susan has had a fantastic time on her school 

              trip to the temple the chances are she'll tell mum or dad. Devotees 

              are beginning to meet parents who say, 'Ah, yes, you came to my 

              daughter's school .' or, 'My son visited your temple and really 

              enjoyed himself .'. </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Analysing our target public, we can observe that 

              it's large and broad although the focus is quite precise, there 

              being a definite ethos and ethic to the educational world.</p>

            <p>Categorising our public in this way has served two purposes. Firstly, 

              to demonstrate the benefits of a schools programme. Secondly, to 

              help us identify with whom we must communicate and establish relationships.</p>

            <h5><b>The Needs, Interests and Concerns of Our School Publics</b></h5>

            <p align=LEFT>It's not enough to simply identify our public; at some 

              stage we need to know something about them. What makes them tick? 

              What are their needs? What interests them? What do they dislike 

              or wish to avoid? These enquires are not specifically mentioned 

              in the communications procedure we're currently studying but this 

              exercise is consistent with it. It's particularly appropriate when 

              making presentations to educational audiences (and I will be discussing 

              this in a future article). However, I give below brief, worked examples 

              for our first two schools publics ( with suggested appropriate responses 

              in brackets).</p>

            <p><i>Pupils:</i></p>

            <ul type="DISC">

              <li> 

                <p>Need to be respected as valuable individuals (don't put them 

                  down)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Need to have a good time (no boring sermons!)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Need to have their senses, mind and intelligence stimulated 

                  (remember that children are perceptive and often philosophically 

                  astute)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Are interested in relationships, sex, money, music, etc. (be 

                  a real person)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Are concerned that guest speakers are often boring, stuffy 

                  and authoritarian (be lively and Krsna conscious)</p>

              </li>

            </ul>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Teachers:</i></p>

            <ul type="DISC">

              <li> 

                <p>Need resources and teaching ideas (provide them)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Are interested in people of other faiths (be prepared to share 

                  yourself and your own experience of life)</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Are concerned that trips to temple or visits from guest speakers 

                  may go wildly wrong (don't proselytise, denigrate other faiths, 

                  be sexist, etc.)</p>

              </li>

            </ul>

            <p>This list could be considerably extended; in summary, however, 

              it's important to get to know our public and understand the principles 

              and ethics upon which it operates.</p>

            <h5><b>The Eight Step Procedure</b></h5>

            <p align=LEFT>According to Mukunda Maharaja (<i>ISKCON Communications 

              Briefing May/June 1992</i>), the next step is to analyse each of 

              these target publics, one by one, asking the following seven questions:</p>

            <p>1. How are we perceived? </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>2. How do we want to be perceived?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY> 3. What behavioural responses do we want?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>4. What messages best facilitate these responses?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>5. What are the obstacles to achieving these responses?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY> 6. What programmes do we currently offer to deliver 

              these messages?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>7. What strategies will achieve the desired response?</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>The eighth, and final step is known as 'Action Plan'.</p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>The dynamics of the whole procedure 

              is based on the first two stages and in trying to minimise the difference 

              between the answers to each question. In other words, success is 

              realised when our public's perception of us tallies with our own 

              ideal. </p>

            <p>Time and space do not permit exploration of the answers to these 

              questions for all our schools publics, although it's an exercise 

              you may consider undertaking yourself. However, I've written down 

              some possible answers derived from experience: example one represents 

              how we are perceived before a schools programme with example two 

              being the desired response following it.</p>

            <p><i>Pupils</i></p>

            <p>Q1: Strange ('look at the way they dress')</p>

            <p>Q2: Unusually good fun ('the best school trip ever')</p>

            <p><i>Teachers:</i></p>

            <p align=LEFT>Example one</p>

            <p align=LEFT>Q1: Confessional approach to life (thoughtless commitment, 

              etc.)</p>

            <p> Q2: Professional/educational (thoughtful, self-reflective, stimulating)</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Example two</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY></p>

            <p>Q1: Socially removed and out of touch. </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Q2: Socially aware (integrated and active in the 

              community)</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Q1: Different </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>Q2: Having similar aims and concerns to ourselves</p>

            <p>You may come up with other suggestions or use this methodology 

              in your own field of service. My experience is that school programmes 

              considerably improve pupils' and teachers' perception of ISKCON, 

              making it more realistic and favourable. </p>

            <p>Let's move on to question three: the behavioural responses we would 

              like from our first public, the pupils. Give up everything and join? 

              Definitely not, at least for the moment. When pupils reach eighteen 

              they'll automatically have that option. And for the spiritual seeker, 

              experiences gained as a pupil will not be in vain. More immediately, 

              though, here are some possibilities:</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>1. To speak favourably about the tradition and its 

              members </p>

            <p align=LEFT>2. To study us further (i.e., renewed or continual contact). 

              Visits in themselves are good - not just a step to something higher 

              or better</p>

            <p align=LEFT>3. To write to us (through our correspondence service)</p>

            <p>4. To explore the relevance of Krsna consciousness in their own 

              lives</p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>5. To explore the relevance of Krsna 

              consciousness in global, social and moral issues</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>With regard to the latter three religious education 

              in the UK emphasises learning from, as well as about, different 

              religions. However, I must reiterate a point made in my last article, 

              that if you respect the integrity of the individual, he or she will 

              feel safe to explore the relevance of Krsna consciousness in their 

              own lives. If we try to 'break them down' or 'smash their false 

              egos' we may end up doing little more than revealing our own inadequacies 

              and scaring people away. </p>

            <p>Continuing the eight-step procedure, step four is particularly 

              important in the light of work done by Mukunda Maharaja.</p>

            <p><b><i>Three Messages</i></b></p>

            <p align=LEFT>The fourth step is to determine the messages that enhance 

              our reputation and help invoke the required behavioural responses. 

              Mukunda Maharaja has analysed three fundamental messages that we 

              should attempt to communicate regarding ISKCON, namely that it is:</p>

            <p>1. Authentic </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>2. Culturally rich</p>

            <p>3. Socially responsible</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>One of the main problems experienced by the schools 

              programme in attempting to communicate the above messages has undoubtedly 

              been the 'cult' label. Whilst here in the UK we're steadily moving 

              away from that image, it remains a severe problem in other countries. 

              Although our connection with a broader, long-standing tradition 

              is immediately clear to those who study our heritage, in the UK 

              (as I suspect in most countries) there is no way we can interact 

              productively with schools if we deny our connection to what is commonly 

              called Hinduism. Since the schools programme in the UK can only 

              operate under the banner of Hinduism, its popularity alone demonstrates 

              that teachers and educationalists accept ISKCON as authentic. (There 

              are, of course, subtle questions about the acceptance of the validity 

              of the broader tradition which will again be addressed in a later 

              issue). </p>

            <p align=LEFT>Little effective transmission of Vedic values is achieved 

              in schools through simple <i>pravachan </i>- as previously mentioned 

              childrens' attention span is limited; they hate sermons (especially 

              the younger ones) and require constant stimulation of the mind and 

              senses. In the UK we've developed a whole range of pastimes - music, 

              drama, puppet shows, classical dance, dressing up, bullock cart 

              rides and full vegetarian lunch, all conveying the message that 

              Vedic culture is not dry and barren but sensually, emotionally and 

              spiritually opulent.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>What, then, of the third message regarding 'social 

              responsibility'? It's an area I feel where ISKCON is making great 

              strides both internally and externally. We're becoming aware of 

              the practical and sociological perspectives of ISKCON, rather than 

              just the philosophical, and of the need to practically demonstrate 

              this philosophy, as well as speak it, in order to convince others 

              of its relevance to the modern world. Our tradition has much to 

              offer: its respect for all forms of life, attitude towards the environment 

              and perspectives on sex, violence, drugs, crime and politics. The 

              Vedic teachings embrace every aspect of human affairs.</p>

            <p>Religions traditionally offer solutions to all life's challenges 

              and religious education generally includes the study of these. There 

              is increasing pressure from the British government for teachers 

              to take responsibility for the spiritual and moral development of 

              pupils. In addition, it's accepted that pupils may learn from their 

              own faiths, or that of others, to make decisions relating to their 

              own welfare in particular and global issues in general.</p>

            <p align=LEFT> We also run workshops for older children which address 

              topical issues. For example we will shortly be putting on programme 

              for sixth formers entitled <i>The Relevance of Vedic Values to the</i> 

              <i>Modern World</i> &quot;. An almost identical programme was held 

              last year featuring <i>The Promise</i> (advertised as a contemporary 

              Hindu drama). The programme was educational rather than preachy 

              and we've heard that pupils were still talking about it four months 

              later. It's also significant to note how this type of programme 

              ties in with the Communications Mission Statement: 'The Hare Krsna 

              movement benefits the individual and society by offering practical 

              solutions to today's material and spiritual problems'. I can therefore 

              emphatically affirm that the schools programme, properly conducted, 

              really pushes home these three messages! </p>

            <h5><b>Looking Towards the Future</b></h5>

            <p align=LEFT>In concluding this rationalisation of the schools programme 

              in terms of modern communications theory and practice, and an analysis 

              of some of our 'keys to success' in the UK, I sincerely hope it 

              has encouraged devotees to start similar projects (or to develop 

              ones already established) and that it gives a vision for the future. 

              And what of our future, here in the UK? </p>

            <p>Well, we've developed more interest than we can currently meet. 

              At Bhaktivedanta Manor alone, we now undertake around five programmes 

              a week, reaching twenty thousand children per year. We are also 

              working with government officials in establishing syllabus guidelines 

              for religious education. Step-by-step, and by Krsna's grace, it's 

              possible to reach our goal of establishing ISKCON Education Services 

              as the number one educational resource on the Vedic tradition.</p>

            <p>What I've been acutely experiencing, though, is a dearth of written 

              material suitable for our specific publics, especially schoolchildren. 

              Furthermore, our work with teachers and educationalists has established 

              that there is a market need for books on Hinduism. Of course, there 

              is a recession, schools are under-resourced and any enterprise is 

              risky. However, we have one distinct advantage in that there already 

              exists both a market and a distribution network for childrens' literature 

              in terms of our own children and those of Hindu families. What I 

              suggest, therefore, is that we, as a Society, consider producing 

              books that are suitable for all of these markets although we would 

              also need to determine what books would appeal to schools in general. 

              Devotees in the UK have already met to discuss this and came up 

              with four options for future book production:</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>1. Krsna consciousness as representative of Hinduism. 

            </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>2. Hinduism from the perspective of our particular 

              tradition/denomination (e.g. Vaishnavism)</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>3. What is generally accepted as representative of 

              the Hindu tradition</p>

            <p>4. Subjects within Hinduism on which ISKCON is accepted as particularly 

              expert</p>

            <p>An analysis of these four options revealed the following: </p>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Option 1 </i>was perceived as being dishonest, ignoring 

              the principles of understanding our public (although I do appreciate 

              that according to Srila Prabhupada Krsna consciousness is the real 

              Hinduism).</p>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Option 2</i> would also be unacceptable to schools 

              as there is very little specialised study within each tradition 

              and teachers may view a denominational approach with suspicion. 

              One possible exception would be a children's <i> Bhagavad-gita</i>.</p>

            <p align=LEFT><i>Option 3</i> was initially rejected, it being considered 

              that there are so many books of this kind on the market already 

              producing more of the same would not further our aims. More recently, 

              however, I've felt that there are tangible benefits to this option 

              particularly in redressing certain identified misconceptions about

            <p align=LEFT><i>Option 4</i> was a favourite with us; for example, 

              the role of Krsna within the Hindu tradition<i>.</i> The greatest 

              potential, however, may be in storybooks as we have such a wealth 

              of stories! Although some have already been published (largely with 

              our own children in mind), these are generally unsuitable for the 

              wider audience as the language is usually inconsistent, not appropriate 

              to the intended readership or full of ISKCON-specific terminology. 

              However, if these books were adapted for the general educational 

              market, they would still be suitable for our own children and those 

              of Hindu families. </p>
