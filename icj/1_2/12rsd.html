            <h4 align=left>Part 1<br>
              <b>The Great Chain</b></h4>
            <p align=LEFT><i>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa endeavours to help devotees 
              understand a certain mentality which he calls 'modern historical 
              consciousness, often encountered when dealing with modern intellectuals 
              and academics. He shows how this consciousness arose out of the 
              breakdown of the worldview that dominated Europe from the second 
              until the eighteenth centuries. That worldview had striking similarities 
              to the Vedic world picture that ISKCON devotees have learned from 
              the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition. Ravindra Svarupa Dasa suggests that 
              in preaching Krsna consciousness we are not introducing something 
              new in Western thought; rather we are bringing back to Western thought 
              something it has lost. </i> 
            <p>The mentality I call 'historical consciousness' stands as one of 
              the pillars of the modern outlook. Historical consciousness is the 
              disposition to perceive every human and natural phenomenon as something 
              given birth and form by the actions of historical forces; indeed 
              such phenomenon are viewed as essentially temporal, constituted 
              by a process that is articulated in developmental and evolutionary 
              terms. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This sort of thinking is second nature to modern 
              people. They seek to understand things in the world by delving into 
              their pasts, by learning how they got that way over the course of 
              time, how they grew and developed historically. The systematic application 
              of such historical consciousness is the common ground of three great 
              patriarchs of the modern world, Darwin, Marx and Freud, who propounded 
              theories of historical development to explain the natural world, 
              human society and individual human psyche respectively. While people 
              may disagree about one such theory or another, they do not question 
              the historical outlook itself and are apt to assume that it is the 
              natural and self-evident way of looking humankind and the world. 
              Yet, as will become apparent, historical consciousness has emerged 
              fairly recently in European history. In other words, historical 
              consciousness is itself an historical phenomenon. 
            <p align=LEFT>'Cause' implies that it has an origin, and whatever 
              has a beginning will also have an end; indeed the word 'cure' suggests 
              that it <i>should </i>end. In some respects, therefore, this is 
              an historical account of historical consciousness itself, and it 
              may be that I will participate quite lavishly in it even as I advocate 
              its demise. However true this is, I do not believe this makes it 
              contradictory or hypocritical. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>As a modern thinker, my mind has been thoroughly 
              steeped - even pickled - in 'modern historical consciousness', although 
              I recognise this inherited mentality as 'non-Vedic'. Having now 
              engaged myself in the practices of Krsna consciousness, I could 
              simply wait for it to go away along with other forms of material 
              conditioning. However, one discovers that when modern historical 
              consciousness comes under the sustained scrutiny of its own gaze 
              - when historical consciousness is examined historically - things 
              are uncovered that help free oneself from its grasp. Srila Prabhupada 
              compares such a procedure to felling a tree with an axe whose handle 
              is fashioned from the tree's own limb. It is therefore important 
              to recognise that this particular way of viewing the world does 
              have a history. It started to develop in Europe during the latter 
              half of the eighteenth century, reached full flower in the nineteenth 
              and, of course, continues largely unabated today. Yet modern thinkers 
              who see the historicity of everything, tend to overlook the historicity 
              of their own historical consciousness. They fail to recognise it 
              as contingent, peculiar and subject to destruction - even self-destruction 
              - in the course of time. 
            <p align=LEFT>Modern historical consciousness arose as the chief expression 
              of a vast shift of consciousness that took place in Europe in the 
              eighteenth century. To understand the particular form it took, we 
              have to first look at the standard worldview that had dominated 
              Europe from Christian times up to that date. The general conception 
              of that worldview is summarised in the expression 'the great chain 
              of being'. The history of this important idea was investigated by 
              Arthur O. Lovejoy, an American philosopher, Arthur O. Lovejoy. He 
              published his work under the title <i>The Great Chain of Being: 
              A Study in the History of an Idea</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University, 
              1936; paperback reprint, New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1960). This 
              book originated as a series of lectures delivered at Harvard University 
              in 1993. Lovejoy's impressive study established him as pioneer in 
              the field of 'history of ideas' and at the same time established 
              the history of ideas as a recognised academic discipline, an event 
              that in itself was a benchmark in the advancement of modern historical 
              consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Lovejoy traces the idea of the great chain of being 
              back into its entrance into Western culture through Plato (especially 
              the famous fifth and sixth books of Plato's epic work, <i>The Republic</i>). 
              The idea of the chain of being is ultimately connected with the 
              concept of what we will call here the Absolute Truth: that is, the 
              self-existent ultimate source of all there is. This concept is clearly 
              articulated in Plato's dialogue on cosmology, the <i>Tamaeus</i>. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Although Plato suggests that direct spiritual experience 
              lies at the foundation of his doctrine of the Absolute Truth, philosophically 
              he arrives at this concept through a sustained process of abstraction; 
              gradually rising from the concrete individuals of sense experience, 
              through the realm of the 'forms' or 'ideas', to the Absolute Truth 
              itself. 
            <p align=LEFT>Many people are vaguely acquainted with the Platonic 
              idea of an unchanging realm of 'ideas' or ideal 'forms' - the Greek 
              word for 'idea' or 'form' being <i>eidon</i>. When 'Platonic form' 
              is mentioned to an ISKCON devotee, he or she usually thinks of <i>rupa</i>, 
              believing the 'realm of ideal forms' to be similar to Goloka Vrndavana, 
              with all its different spiritual forms or bodies. This comparison 
              is quite erroneous, however, as in Plato's realm of 'forms' there 
              are no individuals but rather a collection of abstract essences, 
              each of which corresponds to a class name. For example, there are 
              no cows or humans in the physical sense but there is a single 'form' 
              for 'cow' and one for 'human'. In other words, when you have the 
              word 'cow', there's some objective essence of 'cowness' that corresponds 
              to that word. Therefore, all the individual entities denoted by 
              the word 'cow' must share a common essence. 
            <p align=LEFT>According to Plato, this essence has an eternal existence 
              independent from all particular cows. Cows may come and go but g<i>o-tva</i>, 
              the 'form' of cow, remains and is found with other such abstract 
              essences in a higher realm of 'ideas'. Incidentally, the philosophical 
              doctrine that the essences or referents of class names objectively 
              exist outside the mind in some way or other, is called 'realism', 
              the opposite doctrine being 'nominalism'. 
            <p align=LEFT>There is some truth to Plato's realism. Although the 
              transcendental realm of Vaikuntha (<i>vadam</i> <i>padam</i>) scarcely 
              resembles Plato's realm of ideas, the realm of forms does seem to 
              closely correspond to what the Vedic traditions regard as existent 
              - the <i>Vedas</i> themselves. 
            <p align=LEFT>It is said the <i>Vedas</i> are eternal, while the material 
              world is temporary. It may be asked how this is possible when the 
              Vedas contain the names of temporary entities -'Indra', 'Candra' 
              and so on - all of whom are destroyed during the dissolution. The 
              answer is that the names of the demigods, as well as other names 
              like 'tree', 'cow' etc., are names of types - or rather archetypes 
              - which are instantiated in concrete particulars whenever there 
              is a creation. 
            <p align=LEFT>The <i>Vedas</i> therefore contain the blueprints and 
              assembly instructions for all creation in the material world. Brahma, 
              the created creator, becomes impregnated with the <i>Vedas</i> (<i>veda-garbha</i> 
              ) and thus inspired, brings into manifestation the material world. 
              Interestingly, the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato also posits a creator 
              god - known as <i>demiurgos </i>in Greek - who has a vision of the 
              Absolute Truth and of the form, and is able to insubstantiate those 
              forms in pre-existing matter, thus imposing order on chaos. According 
              to the <i>Bhagavatam,</i> Lord Brahma ( the Vedic creator deity) 
              has a similar direct vision of Vaikuntha and Goloka Vrndavan (as 
              recorded in the <i>Brahma-samhita</i>), but Plato gives no indication 
              of any knowledge of a realm of transcendental variegatedness; the 
              Absolute Truth is described in impersonal terms The Platonic realm 
              of ideal forms, which is subordinate to that Truth, does not therefore 
              (as some devotees have claimed) correspond to the spiritual world 
              (although it seems to closely parallel the <i>Vedas</i>). It is 
              also possible to find a correspondence between the Platonic forms 
              and the creative potentiality latent in the <i>brahmajyoti</i> . 
              We know from the Vedas that the <i>brahmajyoti</i> contains the 
              <i>bija </i>(seeds) for all the species in the world, and that Brahma 
              creates by making the various seeds manifest. The <i>biya</i> seems 
              to be like a Platonic form, at least as these forms are understood 
              in later Neoplatonism (where they are thought to possess a creative 
              potency). 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>By a process of abstraction, Plato arrives at the 
              idea of a realm containing a multiplicity of ideal forms or separated, 
              abstract essences. He carries this speculative ascent still further 
              and concludes that all these forms must have a single, ultimate 
              source, which is the Form of the forms themselves. For example, 
              each individual cow is a cow by virtue of its participating in the 
              form of 'cow'. In the same way, each form is a form by virtue of 
              its participating in the Form of forms. The process of abstraction 
              is thus carried one final step further to the Form of all forms, 
              the essence of all essences. Plato called this 'the Form of the 
              Good'. In fact, three different names are given to this ultimate 
              source - the Good, the True and the Beautiful. 
            <p align=LEFT>This triple characterisation corresponds fairly closely 
              to the Vedic characterisation of Brahman as <i>sat</i> (the Good), 
              <i>cit</i> (the True) and <i>ananda </i>(the Beautiful). The Form 
              of the Good is thus extremely abstract; the source of everything 
              it can be defined only by negation - it is completely ineffable, 
              or inexpressible, in words. At the apex of Plato's ontology - and 
              at the root of much of subsequent European theological thought - 
              is a fairly standard version of the well-known impersonal Absolute. 
              The Form of the Good is perfect, self-sufficient, self-contained 
              and needs nothing other than itself. Yet it boils over, as it were, 
              effervesces, and out of the immutable One devolves the world of 
              changing things. Here's a single entity without name, form, diversity, 
              multiplicity of any sort, and then out of it wells, in a falling 
              away from perfection, a multiplicity - initially of abstract essences, 
              the realm of the forms. Those forms then engender a further multiplicity 
              and instantiate themselves into a gross material world of concrete 
              individuals. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Lovejoy points out that two contrary tendencies are 
              fused in the Platonic idea of the Absolute. On the one side, there 
              is an 'other-worldliness' which produces the idea of a remote, detached, 
              self-contained, self-sufficient Absolute in no need of any other 
              creature, any other thing, or, indeed, of any world at all. On the 
              other side, there is the idea of an Absolute that needs to create, 
              to express itself, to bubble over with joy or zest, to become many. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In the Platonic scheme, the impersonal Absolute cannot, 
              of course, make a free decision to create; rather, the world flows 
              from it out of its own necessity. 
            <p>Lovejoy clearly detects a contradiction in Plato's articulation 
              of the impersonal Absolute. In all consistency, there should be 
              no creation at all. Emanation entails a personal Absolute, a being 
              which completes itself, attains self-fulfilment, in relationship 
              with others. Therefore, the linking of a world, or creation, with 
              an impersonal absolute is not acceptable, as Sankaracarya later 
              realised. 
            <p align=LEFT>Sankara is more single-minded and consistent than Plato 
              in analysing the implications of the 'other worldliness' that produces 
              the conception of the impersonal Absolute. He believes that <i>Brahman</i> 
              does not produce a world, being devoid of energies, one without 
              a second. The world is false, therefore, an illusory superimposition 
              on the Absolute and not an emanation from it - but that's another 
              story! 
            <p align=LEFT> An influential Neoplatonic school of thought arose 
              during the Hellenistic period which resulted in the platonic concept 
              of the Absolute and its emanations undergoing further development 
              and dissemination. From there it decisively entered into mainstream 
              Christian thought through two theologians: St. Augustine (who prior 
              to his conversion was greatly influenced by the writings of Plotinus, 
              a pagan Neoplatonist) and a mystical theologian who wrote under 
              the name of Dionysius of Areopagite. This latter name originally 
              appears in the Acts of the Apostle as that of the convert made by 
              St. Paul while the latter was preaching at the Hills of Mars in 
              Athens (Areopagus). The writings of Dionysius - four treatises of 
              mystical theology, deeply Neoplatonic in nature - originally surfaced 
              in Europe around AD sixth century. Christian authorities accepted 
              them as the works of a direct disciple of St. Paul and therefore 
              considered them highly authoritative. It was not until the seventeenth 
              century that scholars looked more critically at these writings, 
              concluding that the ideas they contained indicated a much later 
              date of origin. The author is now thought to be a fifth century 
              Syrian monk, referred to as 'pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite'. 
            <p align=LEFT>The writings of 'psuedo Dionysius' are notable for a 
              radical theology of negation and the elaborate articulation of the 
              idea of 'hierarchy' (derived from the Greek <i>hieros</i> [holy] 
              and <i>arche </i> [order], and meaning 'sacred' or holy 'order'). 
              According to the hierarchical theory, the structure of being is 
              a divine order with God as its origin and cause. From the Absolute 
              the rest of reality proceeds in the form of ordered, graded steps, 
              each step further from the origin bringing a unit decrease in being 
              or power. At the top of the hierarchy is the One, the ultimate perfection; 
              at the bottom is chaos. A good theologian will conclude that the 
              span from the lowest level to the beginning of the hierarchy is 
              infinite. 
            <p align=LEFT>According to <i>The Heavenly Hierarchy of Dionysius</i>, 
              God is followed by the Angelic hierarchies which consist of nine 
              tiers in descending rank: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, 
              Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels,and Angels. Medieval 
              Christians took angels very seriously with each rank thought to 
              be responsible for running a corresponding level of the material 
              cosmos, which was also hierarchical in structure and consisted of 
              a descending level of spheres centred on the fixed earth. The outer 
              edge was, according to Aristotle, the <i>primum mobile</i>, which 
              imparted motion to the spheres below. The <i>primum mobile</i> was 
              followed by the fixed stars then Saturn Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, 
              Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Dionysius also found a correspondence between the 
              angelic and celestial hierarchies, and the ecclesiastical hierarchies 
              here on earth. In this way, everything has its proper place within 
              the whole. Those entities higher up the ladder, closer to God, partake 
              more of the divine nature - have greater perfection - than those 
              below, yet everything is perfect in its own place. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>During the middle ages and beyond, European thinkers 
              continuously thought about the implications of the idea of the great 
              chain of being. One of the consequences of this is the notion that 
              there could be no gaps, no missing forms, in the hierarchical ladder 
              of creation. This 'principle of plenitude' was inspired by the idea 
              that the production of the world out of the Absolute proceeds by 
              necessity and not by arbitrary, capricious decree. If that is so, 
              what particular forms does it produce? There can only be one answer: 
              all possible forms. If some forms were absent, creation would have 
              been an arbitrary, irrational act; however the Absolute is, above 
              all, logical and rational, hence the principle of plenitude. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Creation therefore exhibits a lavish profusion of 
              forms organised unto a unified, rational order of being - a single 
              overarching hierarchy. The hierarchical order of the whole is in 
              turn mirrored within each of its sub-divisions. Each category of 
              beings neatly reflects the order of the whole - hierarchies nested 
              within hierarchies. As God is supreme among all beings, so the king 
              is supreme among men, the lion among animals, the eagle among birds, 
              the dolphin among aquatics, gold among minerals, ether among elements. 
              Thus the magnificent and awesome order of creation, in which the 
              same clear stamps of the divine exhibits itself everywhere, opens 
              itself to the contemplative mind which in turn receives a great 
              deal of satisfaction in meditating on its fullness, rationality 
              and sublime harmony. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The eventual collapse of the great chain of being 
              - which Frederick Nietzsche later described as the 'murder of God' 
              - was an immense and revolutionary change in consciousness, which 
              was so profound that modern Westerners now have to approach their 
              not-so-distant past as something completely foreign and strange. 
              It is also interesting to note that the worldview of the Gaudiya 
              Vaisnava tradition, recently exported from India into the West, 
              should so profoundly resemble that of the great chain of being which 
              dominated the West for so long. 
            <p>One of the most elegant and concise descriptions of the great chain 
              of being was expressed by Alexander Pope in a poem composed at the 
              end of the eighteenth century: 
            <ul>
              <p>Vast chain of being! <br>
              <p>Which from God began, <br>
              <p align=JUSTIFY>nature's ethereal, human, angel, man, <br>
              <p>beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see, <br>
              <p align=JUSTIFY>no glass can reach, from Infinite to thee, <br>
              <p> from thee to nothing 
            </ul>
            <p>In the modern era of rapid turnover in ideas and ideologies, the 
              sheer persistence of the idea of the great chain over the centuries 
              may seem astonishing. For example, early in the fifth century Macrobius 
              presented this condensed version of Plotinus's doctrines: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Since, from the Supreme God Mind arises and from Mind, 
                Soul, and since this in turn creates all subsequent things and 
                fills them all with life, and since the single radiance illuminates 
                all and is reflected in each as a single face might be reflected 
                in many mirrors placed in a series; and since all things follow 
                in continuous succession, degenerating in sequence to the very 
                bottom of the series, the attentive observer will discover a connection 
                of parts from the Supreme God down to the last dregs of things, 
                mutually linked together and without a break. And this is Homer's 
                golden chain <i>(from Jupiter)</i> which God, he says, bade down 
                from heaven to earth. 
            </ul>
            <p>Naturally the theory of the great chain underwent a great deal 
              of development and modification over the years. For example, an 
              attempt to cement the Christian revelation of a personal creator 
              onto the Neoplatonic concept of impersonal emanation met with limited 
              success. In orthodox Christian thought, creation has to be an act 
              of free will, yet whenever theologians tried to think about creation, 
              the idea that it was an emanation born out of necessity arose. 
            <p>There is one aspect of the chain that has not been considered by 
              philosophers such as Lovejoy. It is intrinsic within the Platonic 
              and Neoplatonic concept that not only is the chain a structure descending 
              from God but it also serves as a ladder of ascent for the soul going 
              back to God. In the Christian context, this path of ascent could 
              only be followed in contemplation, as the mind rose step by step 
              to the summit. In the original Platonic and Neoplatonic context, 
              however, the chain was not only a path for contemplation but also 
              for the ascent of the soul through the process of transmigration. 
            <p align=LEFT>Christian philosophers retained the idea of the chain 
              as a path leading up to God but the Church rejected the allied doctrine 
              of transmigration of the soul. One of the consequences of this was 
              eventually an increasing sense of stasis, of frustration. The possibility 
              of evolving up the chain through one's improved <i>karma</i> is 
              absent - you are stuck where you are. The hierarchies of human society 
              are seamlessly part of the cosmic universal hierarchy, and gradually 
              the whole system began to seem enormously oppressive to many people. 
            <p
                             align=LEFT>The idea of transmigration having been 
              rejected, individual progress within the world system was also ruled 
              out. The concept of the great chain naturally supported an ongoing 
              social and political conservatism; the perfection for each person 
              consisted of conforming to the requirements of his own place and 
              not striving to rise to another (an idea also found in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>). 
              However, people still need some sort of prospect for progress. The 
              loss of the notion of transmigration, once an integral part of the 
              idea of the chain, turned the social conservatism of the hierarchy 
              into oppression; when in frustration common people sought to overthrow 
              kings and nobles for self-advancement, they brought down with them 
              the whole cosmos, and the chain collapsed. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This event was part and parcel of the disappearance 
              of the Absolute Truth, the God of Parminides Plato and Plotinus, 
              the root of existence as a coherent, divinely ordered structure. 
              On their deepest level, Shakespeare's great tragedies, Hamlet and 
              Othello, chronicle this collapse; their protagonists face the most 
              dire consequences when they transgress the proper actions of their 
              ordained place in the divine scheme. This is why Othello says of 
              his chaste wife: 'When I love thee not, chaos is come again' and 
              the villain Iago expresses explicit disbelief in the idea that any 
              of us have ordained natures or essences, proclaiming that it is 
              only in our wills that we are what we are. Edmund, the Bastard, 
              the villain in King Lear, has a new vision of nature - one not of 
              order and harmony but of strife and struggle, a nature whose gods 
              will 'now stand up for bastards!' Shakespeare's villains all speak 
              modern philosophy: the foundations were shaking even in his time 
              and he felt it deeply. His heroes peered into the abyss. 
            <p>Lovejoy has an interesting observation to make about the collapse 
              of the chain; because it had structure, it did not simply plunge 
              the world into chaos. If the chain can be imagined as a rigid ladder, 
              when it lost its transcendental mooring in the divine it did not 
              crumble into a disordered heap but rather fell over onto its side. 
              Retaining its sequential hierarchical structure, the chain became 
              temporalised; its axis was no longer the vertical, ontological axis 
              from chaos to God but a horizontal axis from the primitive chaos 
              of the past to present human development and the future progression 
              towards greater and greater perfection. This transposition of the 
              axis of the chain of being is the origin of modern historical consciousness.
