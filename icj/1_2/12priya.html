              Dasa</a></h2>
            <p><i>The following article is an extract taken from the newly-published 
              'Food for Life Manual', written by Priyavrata Dasa and published 
              by ISKCON Communications. It is a useful resource for anyone interested 
              in Food for Life and covers all aspects of this preaching and welfare 
              programme. </i> 
            <p align=LEFT>The first thing to know about fundraising is that it 
              begins with fundraising; this means learning how to cultivate long-lasting 
              friendships. We do this by being honest, respectful, humble and 
              tolerant. Unless we can demonstrate these qualities, we can't expect 
              to gain the full support and reciprocation of the public. Therefore, 
              before you get carried away with how much money your temple could 
              make from a Food for Life programme, it is important to understand 
              the need to be honest. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Srila Prabhupada was particularly insistent that 
              money collected for food relief programmes be utilised for those 
              programmes. He felt that if everything we did was above suspicion, 
              we would see an amazing amount of public appreciation and financial 
              support for our Food for Life programme. Practically, this means 
              that fundraising will no longer be required; donations will literally 
              pour in because everyone likes to give, especially to a cause that 
              they have faith in and know will utilise their donation properly. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY> Therefore, our first concern should be to develop 
              long-lasting friendships, by demonstrating true Vaisnava qualities 
              and also by seeing everyone with whom we come into contact as potential 
              Krsna bhaktas. 
            <p align=LEFT><b> Building a reputation is essential for fundraising</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>A good reputation is essential in fundraising, as people 
              are not going to give to any organisation that doesn't have one. 
              In order to attain this, we have to get rid of any bad reputation 
              we may have, through re-education, improving communications, erasing 
              misconceptions, practising what we preach, and maybe even changing 
              our strategies. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>A good example of this is the Salvation Army. Most 
              people are unaware that this is a splinter group of the Methodist 
              Church. In the early nineteenth century, the Army was out on the 
              streets banging drums and blowing horns with a true evangelistic 
              spirit. However, their sincere attempts to glorify God with music 
              and song were not appreciated; in fact, they were ridiculed by the 
              public, beaten and practically forced off the streets. Does this 
              sound familiar? They decided, therefore, to adjust their strategy 
              by incorporating a welfare service into their programme, specifically, 
              feeding and clothing the poor in times of war. The result was immediate 
              acceptance by the public and a wonderful reputation which is still 
              flourishing today. In fact, their reputation is so strong that the 
              words 'welfare' and caring' are practically synonymous with the 
              Salvation Army. 
            <p align=LEFT><b> How we did it in Australia</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Some of you may be familiar with the history of the 
              Australian <i>yatra</i>. When Krsna consciousness began there devotees 
              were subject to persecution, both from the public and the media. 
              In 1980, however, <i>Sixty Minutes</i>, Australia's most popular 
              social affairs television programme, featured a story on the 'Children 
              of Krsna', and ISKCON's reputation changed literally overnight. 
              Taking advantage of this, the Australian leaders embarked upon a 
              major propaganda campaign, producing two colour magazine inserts 
              which were put into all the country's leading newspapers. This was 
              followed by a bus party that visited every major town in Australia, 
              distributing books and free <i>prasadam</i>, as well as promoting 
              the cause of the oppressed devotees in the Soviet Union (which culminated 
              in the production of a record by Prahlada Dasa entitled <i>Mr Gorbachev, 
              Set Them Free</i>). As a result of all this, the movement was favourably 
              reported in every single newspaper, television news broadcast and 
              radio show in Australia! 
            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>Alongside the Soviet campaign, Hare 
              Krsna Food for Life also began to prosper. Started in 1978 from 
              the Kings Cross temple, this programme achieved national recognition 
              in the mid eighties when it was seen as a practical solution to 
              a major social problem. At that time, Australia was experiencing 
              an unprecedented rise in unemployment and inflation, and thousands 
              of people were struggling to make ends meet. Food for Life was seen 
              as a positive input from ISKCON. One well-known social reformer, 
              Revd. Ted Noffs, commented during a 1986 television interview: 'I 
              think that the Hare Krsnas will fulfil the role that the Salvation 
              Amy fulfilled in the nineteenth century ... it's not just a hand-out, 
              it's a hand-out with something else - human compassion - and it 
              gives welfare a human face.' 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>In addition to these successful welfare campaigns, 
              the Australia devotees also utilised Food for Life to cultivate 
              leading government officials, by encouraging them to endorse the 
              programme and even practically engaging them in serving meals. This 
              pro-active preaching, together with a more mature approach to street 
              activities (such as the cessation of unlawful fundraising techniques), 
              means that today the devotees experience a healthy reputation all 
              over Australia and New Zealand. This respectability has helped ISKCON 
              gain, to date, in excess of three hundred thousand dollars in grants 
              from the federal government and private foundations. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Truthfulness</b> 
            <p align=LEFT> According to the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, 'Truthfulness 
              is the last leg of religion'. Srila Prabhupada himself said that 
              that we become adored for our honesty. In a letter to Rupanuga in 
              January 1975, he wrote: 'Regarding the controversy about book distribution 
              techniques, you are right. Our occupation must be honest. Everyone 
              should adore our members as honest. If we do something which is 
              deteriorating to the popular sentiments of the public in favour 
              of our movement, that is not good. Somehow or other we should not 
              become unpopular in the public eye. These dishonest methods must 
              be stopped. It is hampering our reputation all over the world. Money 
              collected for feeding people in India should be collected under 
              the name ISKCON Food Relief. Not any other name. And every farthing 
              of that money must be sent to India, or better yet, buy food grains 
              there and ship them here and we will distribute. But every farthing 
              collected for that purpose must be used for that purpose.' 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>We should strictly adhere to this essential religious 
              principle of truthfulness, not only for the sake of purity but as 
              a way to enhance our reputation and qualify ourselves as worthy 
              recipients of the public's donations. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>The 'half hen' logic</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>There is a story of a man who had a chicken but who 
              was only interested in getting the egg. He didn't want the trouble 
              of feeding the chicken, therefore he foolishly concluded that the 
              best thing to do would be to cut off the chicken's head! Thus he 
              would still have the benefit of the egg but not the worry of feeding 
              the chicken. 
            <p align=LEFT>Srila Prabhupada often gave this analogy to condemn 
              the <i>mayavadis</i> who are only willing to accept those parts 
              of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> that suit their arguments. This same 
              analogy could be applied to Food for Life management. In other words, 
              we must be willing to put in the same amount to the programme that 
              we wish to take out. Unfortunately, many of these programmes are 
              still managed using the 'half-hen' ethos, with the result that they 
              are being exploited and mismanaged, both legally and ethically. 
              As Srila Prabhupada said, 'we should be adored for our honesty.' 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Why people donate</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>There are three major reasons why a person will give 
              in charity to one organisation, but not another: 
            <p align=LEFT><i>The mission: </i>They believe the cause is worthy 
              of support, the vast majority of people appreciating the benefits 
              of feeding the needy. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Food for Life scores high on this point. However, 
              because people also want a vision of a better future, our mission 
              must be clearly defined and include a proposed solution to the problem 
              of hunger. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>The quality of people involved: </i>The people in 
              charge of the charity are viewed as being of good character, are 
              seen to practise what they preach and are considered to be committed 
              to the mission. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Food for Life would benefit from improvement in this 
              area. We need to have better qualified devotees representing the 
              programme both in terms of fundraising and cooking; after all, they 
              are meant to be ambassadors for our movement and as such, we as 
              a Society, are being judged on their behaviour. There is a common 
              saying amongst devotees in the United States: 'Food for Life for 
              me and my wife'. This may sound humorous but the implications of 
              this avaisnava behaviour could be disastrous for our movement. Unless 
              we can demonstrate honesty and perfect character, we cannot expect 
              widespread support for the programme. In this respect, there should 
              be as much encouragement from our leaders for devotees engaged in 
              Food for Life as there is for book distributors. These devotees 
              should also be consulted when determining strategies and directions 
              for the programme - after all, they are the ones who see the problems 
              and results of food distribution, and their opinion should therefore 
              be valued. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>The financial stability of the organisation</i>: 
              the person sees the charity as accountable and trusts them to spend 
              their donation properly. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This is another area in which we need to improve. 
              We cannot expect people to blindly donate their money without the 
              assurance of accountability. All successful non profit-making organisations 
              spend a large percentage of their time and energy in demonstrating 
              this quality. One of the more obvious ways of doing this is by sending 
              regular newsletters to donors outlining progress of current projects, 
              highlighting future developments, and providing a detailed income 
              and expenditure report. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The fact is, if we wish to get large donations, we 
              must be willing to literally open our books to the public, who are 
              more likely to support an organisation which is seen as professional 
              and honest, run by dedicated and highly regarded staff. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The right, right method</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>One logical and practical rule of fundraising is the 
              'right' method: we should ask the right person in the right way, 
              at the right time, for the right amount, in the right place and 
              through the right person, For example, if you ask a little old lady 
              on the street for a one million dollar donation, you'll get nothing, 
              and if you ask a millionaire on the street for a dollar , you'll 
              still get nothing. Not only because such a small donation is an 
              embarrassment to the latter, but it's also neither the right place 
              nor the right way to request money from him; rich people don't make 
              large donations on street corners. Instead, a meeting should be 
              arranged - at which <i>prasadam</i> is served - where detailed information 
              can be provided on the programme and how the donor can invest in 
              it. Referring back to the 'half-hen' theory, we can only expect 
              to get back what we are willing to put in. Of course, in order to 
              obtain such a meeting in the first place, it is necessary to go 
              through the right person. This means we should be recommended by 
              an individual or organisation respected by our potential donor. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The Pyramid</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>The science of fundraising can best be understood in 
              terms of a pyramid. The bottom layer represents the unlimited potential 
              donors for a Food for Life programme: this is known as 'the universe'. 
              Every organisation has their own universe, consisting of all the 
              people who have ever come into contact with them. For us, this means 
              contacts made via book distribution, restaurant customers, attendees 
              of Sunday feasts, temple visitors, relatives of devotees, etc. The 
              idea is to bring these contacts to the first level of the pyramid 
              - getting them to donate to Food for Life. Naturally the percentage 
              of first-time donors will be less than the initial universe. The 
              second level represents those who make a second donation or who 
              renew their commitment, which again will be a smaller percentage. 
              The third level consists of people who regularly give to the programme, 
              but whose donations are sporadic and who have no firm commitment. 
              The fourth level is those people who have made a concrete commitment 
              and make regular large donations. The top layer (or peak) of the 
              pyramid consists of those who are willing to donate their life savings 
              to the organisation; these people often start at the bottom of the 
              pyramid and slowly work their way up over a long period of time. 
              They represent the smallest percentage of donors but their donations 
              are the largest. In fact, it is said that eighty per cent of all 
              donations come from twenty per cent of donors - namely, the top 
              two levels of the pyramid. It is therefore logical that eighty percent 
              of fundraising efforts should be concentrated on this twenty per 
              cent of donors. The idea is to gradually bring people to higher 
              and higher levels of the pyramid, and this requires patience and 
              long-term vision. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Say 'thank you'</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Although it is important to spend a large amount of 
              time with regular donors, this does not mean that you neglect the 
              other eighty per cent. Everyone's contribution should be appreciated. 
              We have to be patient and be prepared to spend a long time cultivating 
              people over many years. The tendency has been to get as much from 
              people in the shortest possible time and never worry about them 
              again - no thanks, no recognition and no sensitivity. However, another 
              important rule of fundraising is to say 'thank you' at least seven 
              times! Everyone likes to be appreciated so thank donors personally; 
              write them a 'thank you' letter; give them a certificate of recognition; 
              print their name in your temple newsletter; send a card on their 
              birthday; give them <i> prasadam</i>. If you do this, people will 
              give again and again, and gradually rise up to the top levels of 
              the pyramid. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Working smarter, not harder</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>We need to start working smarter, not harder, which 
              means doing things in a systematic and professional manner. Every 
              temple should collect a database of contacts and start using them; 
              in other words, get them working for us. We're supposed to represent 
              the <i>brahminical</i> culture, the intelligence of society. It 
              is our responsibility to engage people in Krsna's service. For example, 
              say you need to package ten thousand burfis for a weekend programme. 
              Instead of engaging ten <i> brahmacaris</i> in a day's labour, it 
              would be much smarter to ring up all your contacts and ask whether 
              they would like to do a little devotional service for Krsna. This 
              is what it means to be resourceful, and a <i> brahmana</i> is a 
              most resourceful person! 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Foundation membership</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>A good way to create a steady financial basis for your 
              programme to approach friends, family, business contacts, etc. to 
              become a Food for Life foundation member. A suggested price range 
              might be: five hundred dollars per year (gold member), two hundred 
              and fifty dollars a year (silver member), and one hundred and eight 
              dollars a year (Prabhupada member). Members could pay this money 
              as a lump sum or in instalments. The membership package could include: 
              a special framed certificate of appreciation; a membership card; 
              some of Prabhupada's books; a Krsna poster; regular newsletter, 
              and <i>prasada</i>. The newsletter can be in a two-page format, 
              giving a short report on the progress of the programme, future plans, 
              a story, financial report and list of new members. This sharing 
              of information and honesty will be much appreciated. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The programme is similar to Life Membership, but 
              a little more affordable. However, we shouldn't fall into the same 
              trap of promising too many benefits as with Life Membership - better 
              to give what you can practically afford. The most important thing 
              to offer members is truthfulness - tell them the spiritual benefits 
              of investing in this important welfare project. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Fundraising products</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Whenever we go shopping, we are guaranteed to see some 
              type of fundraising confectionery displayed at the counter. There 
              is no reason, therefore, why Food for Life should not have its own 
              line of Fundraising products. It may only be a packet of cookies 
              or small plastic bags of burfi, but you will be surprised at the 
              response. Last year, one confectionery company in England made twenty 
              million pounds from a single chocolate bar! In Australia, a group 
              of devotees developed a chewy fruit and nut confection which they 
              called 'Bliss Bar'. These bliss bars are offered to the Deities 
              at the Melbourne temple and have been steadily selling for over 
              ten years. Indeed, for at least three to four years, the bars were 
              exclusively used on all flights of an Australian airline. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Our famous Hare Krsna cookbooks are literally overflowing 
              with delicious and unique sweets and savoury snacks. Unfortunately, 
              very few devotees have attempted to pursue this huge potential. 
              Those that have are not always successful, due partly to impatience 
              and attempting to expand sales too quickly. However, there are also 
              success stories. 
            <p align=LEFT>When fundraising with <i>prasadam</i>, an extra ingredient 
              can be added - the sales angle. You can make it clear that all - 
              or almost all - profits go towards feeding the needy. It is a well-known 
              fact that as much as seventy per cent of profits raised during fundraising 
              drives are swallowed up by administration. In Australia, the law 
              states that no more than fifty per cent of charitable donations 
              can be legally justified for covering administrative costs. However, 
              just because it is legally justifiable, doesn't mean to say it is 
              acceptable in the eyes of the public. Therefore we should ensure 
              that the majority of profits obtained from fundraising confectionery 
              will go towards furthering the aims of Food for Life rather than 
              its administration or management. H. H. Mukunda Goswami has put 
              forward the excellent suggestion that the exact percentage of profits 
              we intend to use in feeding the needy is advertised on confectionary 
              packets so the public can see for themselves how their money is 
              being spent. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Clipboards</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>This is an easy method of raising small amounts of money, 
              but unfortunately, is one which is most often abused by devotees. 
              Temples need to be extremely vigilant in stamping out unauthorised 
              collecting in the name of Food for Life. Devotees undertaking this 
              form of fundraising should be issued with an identification badge, 
              with a recent and happy photo of themselves and if necessary, carry 
              a permit from the local authorities and/or Charity Commission permitting 
              them to collect public donations in the street. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>The procedure itself is very simple. The clipboard 
              contains a newspaper article on one side and sheet of paper with 
              columns headed 'name', 'address' and 'amount', on the other. Not 
              only will this encourage prospective donors to give, seeing that 
              others have done before them, but it is also a good way of collecting 
              names and addresses for the programme database. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>The beggar image</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>There is a danger, of course, that clipboard fundraising 
              may been seen as begging by the public and will not be appreciated 
              if it gets to the point of saturation, i.e. devotees are seen asking 
              for donations at the same place every day. Things became so bad 
              in Australia at one stage, that devotees could barely appear on 
              the streets without being arrested and imprisoned. This type of 
              fundraising is therefore best kept to the minimum and we should, 
              wherever possible, use methods that demonstrate to the public how 
              ISKCON devotees are independent and productive members of the community. 
              As Srila Prabhupada put it: 'We are not dependent on anyone's contribution, 
              we are dependent on Krsna.'
