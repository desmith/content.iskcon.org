              H. Sridhar Swami</a></h2>

            <p>I think we actually enjoy being broke. We are the wealthiest people 

              with the best product in the most profitable market, and yet we 

              are keeping ourselves broke. I am afraid that I don't know how to 

              talk about this. I don't want to be offensive to <i>sadhus</i> (my 

              audience) but some people need haranguing to get the message. I 

              know we have God on our side; I know we are the only pure ones; 

              I know that Srila Prabhupada's books will be the Law Books for the 

              next ten thousand years; I know that all we have to do is chant 

              'Hare Krsna' and distribute books, and everything will happen automatically, 

              mystically. But I also know there are a few details that we have 

              to attend to. Srila Prabhupada once asked, 'What is the qualification 

              for becoming Krsna conscious? A devotee replied (sincerely), 'Sincerity, 

              Srila Prabhupada.' 'No!' said Srila Prabhupada, . sincerity and 

              intelligence.' </p>

            <p>We have intelligent and, more importantly, committed people in 

              our movement. That alone is the greatest factor in building a successful 

              team. Corporations literally spend hundreds of thousands of dollars 

              to instil a spirit of commitment in their leaders and subordinates. 

              From top to bottom, we have people who are committed to the same 

              goal. So the question arises: 'Why can't we develop a secure financial 

              base by which we can escape from the crisis management trap and 

              engage in our real business - preaching, teaching, book selling, 

              counselling and ministering to the fallen conditioned souls?' The 

              answer is: 'It beats me!' </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>The money is there: we just have to put our hands 

              out and pick it up. 'When you have money in the bank, management 

              is easy.' Prabhupada told reporters: 'If I just sat underneath a 

              tree here in Juhu beach, Bombay, nobody would come to listen to 

              me. Therefore I have built this grand temple.' Shall I explain to 

              you the greatest 'get rich quick' formula for ISKCON: in America 

              we say, 'It don't exist!' As Henry Russo, a leading guru in the 

              135 billion dollar a year non profit-making sector, says 'Fundraising 

              is not easy'! No magic formula has ever been devised to transform 

              a fervent, even desperate, wish into instant results. There is a 

              discipline to gift development that progresses in logical order 

              from preparation to planning, from programme execution to control. 

            </p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>This sequence of orderliness is depicted in a continuum 

              often referred to as 'the cycle of fundraising'. Successful non 

              profit-making organisations are as concerned about marketing techniques 

              and their ability to prepare wise marketing plans as any profit-making 

              corporation. The non profit-making - or social purpose - organisation 

              must critically assess its worth and examine its mission, to determine 

              whether this mission is being interpreted properly through measurable 

              objectives and meaningful programmes and to evaluate its overall 

              impact on the market area. The cycle can serve as an effective instrument 

              to help executives of non profit-making agencies visualise the relationships 

              of fundraising elements. It permits them to see the sequence to 

              follow from preparation, or definition, of case through to the solicitation 

              and annual renewal of gifts. Fundraising cannot be an haphazard 

              impulsive action, improvised at the last moment in response to a 

              crisis situation: fund-raising is an exercise in discipline.</p>

            <p align=JUSTIFY>But don't lose hope folks, there is still a chance. 

              We are disciples and we can become disciplined. The International 

              Membership Ministry and the ISKCON Foundation have been formed to 

              teach devotees the skills and techniques of fundraising. Naveen 

              Krsna Dasa, the personnel of the ISKCON Foundation and myself have 

              studied and tested modern marketing methods such as direct mail, 

              telephone campaigns, capital campaigns, special events, etc. I have 

              complete confidence that ISKCON can succeed in a very big way. Techniques 

              and skills are not enough, however. First you and I must create 

              a paradigm shift. From where we are now, I would say it would require 

              a revolution in our consciousness and the way we deal with our congregation. 

              Based on the experience gained from my travels, and on a scale of 

              one to ten, I would have to rate most of our temples at about three 

              for 'quality customer care'. In addition, London Soho Street temple 

              has recently conducted a survey, first with the devotees of the 

              temple and later with the congregation. To everybody's surprise, 

              both gave the temple a rating of three to four out of ten. Obviously 

              you can't preach to, or solicit funds from, a congregation when 

              your attitude towards them is negative or at best indifferent.</p>

            <p align=LEFT>The first area where vast improvement can be made is 

              in our dealings with devotees. We have to learn to treat the devotees 

              the way we want the devotees (preachers) to treat the congregation. 

              For example, meet with devotees on a regular basis and discuss the 

              twenty-six qualities of a pure devotee; discuss problems in devotee 

              relationships and ways they can be solved by proper Vaisnava etiquette. 

              Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura had a system in his math that 

              every <i>brahmacari</i> would try to render five kinds of service 

              to other Vaisnavas in the math every day. Therefore, think of ways 

              to reward devotees who are good examples. Now, some people might 

              think that this has nothing to do with building a congregation and 

              collecting and paying the bills. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong! In the business 

              sector where people are paid to work and give service, the leaders 

              of the <i>Fortune 500</i> companies still strive to establish good 

              relations with their employees: 'Motivate them, train them, care 

              about them and make winners out of them ... we know that if we treat 

              our employees correctly, they'll treat the customers right. And 

              if the customers are treated right, they'll come back.' (J. W. Marriott 

              Jr., Chairman and President, Marriott Corporation). </p>

            <p>How to motivate devotees? In a five-year survey of workers in America, 

              results indicated that being able to exercise creativity, obtain 

              recognition for achievements and the feeling of being useful both 

              to the company and society were the most powerful motivating influences 

              in employment, with salary at number four or five. Managers and 

              team leaders must constantly encourage the devotees and thank them 

              for their service. Are these things Srila Prabhupada did? You bet 

              your life they are. Even in his last days in Vrindavan when a disciple 

              would arrive His Divine Grace, while lying on his bed, would cry 

              out names, saying what a nice devotee they were and how he was indebted 

              to them. You can perhaps understand what this did to the hearts 

              of everyone present. When Srila Prabhupada was asked how his disciples 

              would be recognised, what was the answer? They will wear dhotis? 

              They will have large neck beads? They will have a big halo? No! 

              He said they will be perfect gentlemen. Are our devotees perfect 

              gentlemen when guests come to the temple or when they meet a congregational 

              member? I don't know - you will have to be the judge of that. Soho 

              Street devotees concluded not. Here's the secret: please think about 

              it. 'What gets rewarded gets done.' Devotees will listen to what 

              you tell them; they will believe what you do; but they will do what 

              you reward.</p>

            <p align=LEFT>In ISKCON at present, we only reward quantity. The number 

              of books sold; the total money collected; the number of Life Members 

              enrolled; the number of plates of <i>prasadam </i>distributed. We 

              only strive for quantity and neglect quality. However, after reading 

              one of those millions of books distributed, our congregation and 

              people in general think: 'Oh this is a nice philosophy. After following 

              it I wonder what kind of a person one becomes. Are they polite, 

              courteous and attentive to my needs or will they just ignore me 

              because they have something else to do at the time. Let me go to 

              their temple and see for myself.' So we have to reward the devotees 

              for what I call 'quality customer care' (the congregation, readers 

              of our books and visitors to our temples being our customers).</p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>Here's another truism: people do what 

              gets measured. I cannot stress that point too strongly. Every important 

              goal needs to be accompanied with a way to keep score so that you 

              and your team of devotees can measure the progress towards reaching 

              your objectives. Additionally, keeping score and letting devotees 

              know how they are doing is a tremendous motivational tool. Just 

              like in the non-devotee world, would people enjoy playing golf, 

              tennis, soccer or whatever if there were no way of keeping score? 

              Here are some things to look for: </p>

            <ul>

              <p>1. Number of congregational complaints received every week (every 

                temple should have a suggestion/complaint box)</p>

              <p> 2. Number of complimentary letters received every month</p>

              <p>3. Number of square feet cleaned per day</p>

              <p align=JUSTIFY>4. Percentage of donations coming from repeat donors</p>

              <p align=JUSTIFY> 5. Number of congregational devotees involved 

                in service</p>

            </ul>

            <p>I would also suggest you follow these guidelines when attempting 

              to measure progress: </p>

            <ul type="DISC">

              <li> 

                <p>Don't let anybody con you into believing that you can't measure 

                  what they do. If what they are doing can't be measured, they 

                  aren't contributing. </p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Keep it simple. Otherwise, devotees will spend too much time 

                  measuring, rather than pursuing, their goals.</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Measure progress toward goals achieved and not activities performed.</p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Remember that it is far more important to measure group than 

                  individual goals: team performance counts the most. We have 

                  a tendency in ISKCON to reward the top man without considering 

                  the team that backs him up. </p>

              </li>

              <li> 

                <p>Finally, remember that the best performance measures give devotees 

                  frequent feedback so that they can see how they are doing and 

                  adjust their performance accordingly. Put up a highly visible 

                  chart, poster or scoreboard and update it regularly. There are 

                  many different ways you can reward devotees - personal thanks, 

                  a trip to Mayapur, recognition in front of the community. I 

                  am sure you can use your imagination. </p>

              </li>

            </ul>

            <p align=LEFT></p>

            <p>The second area we can immediately improve is the Sunday feast. 

              I remember that in Los Angeles in 1970 the Sunday feast was a gala 

              event, and we usually made five to ten new devotees each week. Many 

              of those stayed to render years of devotional service. We actually 

              started planning the Sunday feast on Monday. Every devotee had some 

              duty ... from serving <i> prasada</i>, to watching the shoes, to 

              sitting with guests and preaching to them. Devotees spent all week 

              rehearsing plays and dramas. On Sunday, all visitors to the temple 

              were greeted, given a tour and preached to. </p>

            <p

                             align=LEFT>Today we go out to distribute books, preach 

              in colleges, etc., but when people come to our temples they often 

              get indifferent treatment. Reception of guests is given a low priority. 

              <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> 8:16:6 and 8:16:7 states that any guest 

              in one's house (even an enemy) should be treated royally even if 

              he comes unannounced. The homes where this kind of treatment is 

              not given are considered to be homes of jackals. Obviously some 

              temples are better than others, but my honest opinion is that we 

              have fallen a long way from the standard. Managers must organise 

              the training of devotees in this area and recognition should be 

              given for outstanding service in 'quality customer care'. </p>

            <p>Let me leave you with a few statistics to think about regarding 

              what happens when someone comes to our temple and has a bad experience, 

              and what factors contribute to a bad experience:</p>

            <p>1. A typical business hears from only four per cent of its dissatisfied 

              customers. The other ninety-six per cent just quietly go away and 

              ninety-one per cent will never come back. That represents a serious 

              loss for temples that don't know how to treat guests and a tremendous 

              gain for those that do.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>2. A survey on 'why customers quit' found the following: </p>

            <p align=LEFT><b>Three per cent</b> move away</p>

            <p align=LEFT><b>Five per cent</b> develop other friendships</p>

            <p align=LEFT><b>Nine per cent</b> leave for competitive reasons</p>

            <p align=LEFT><b>Fourteen per cent</b> are dissatisfied with the product</p>

            <p align=LEFT><b>Sixty-eight per cent</b> quit because of an attitude 

              of indifference toward the customer by the owner, manager or an 

              employee</p>

            <p>3. A typical dissatisfied customer will tell eight to ten people 

              about his problem. One in five will tell twenty. It takes twelve 

              positive incidents to make up for one negative incident.</p>

            <p>4. Seven out of ten complaining customers will do business with 

              you again if you resolve the complaint in their favour. If you resolve 

              it on the spot, ninety-five per cent will do business with you again. 

              On average, a satisfied complainer will tell five people about the 

              problem and how it was satisfactorily resolved.</p>

            <p>5. The average business spends six times more to attract new customers 

              than it does to keep old ones. Yet customer loyalty is, in most 

              cases, worth ten times the price of a single purchase.</p>

            <p>6. Businesses having low service quality average only one per cent 

              return on sales and lose market share at the rate of two per cent 

              per year. Businesses with high service quality average twelve per 

              cent return on sales, gain market share at the rate of six per cent 

              per year and charge significantly higher prices.</p>

            <p

                             align=JUSTIFY>Maybe we do have God on our side, maybe 

              devotees are pure, maybe our book distribution is powerful, but 

              maybe we should also use our intelligence and see how we can improve 

              our preaching rather than rest on our past laurels and old paradigms. 

              We are not the first group to try to spread a spiritual idea: Srila 

              Prabhupada told us to take note of the management techniques of 

              the Rama Krsna Mission, Tirupati Devasthanam and the Catholic Church. 

              Maybe we have to take Rupa Goswami's advice - copy success and use 

              it in Krsna's service. Perhaps our fund-raising will be then become 

              'fun-raising'.</p>
