              Do you recognise the dialogue?&nbsp; Yes, it's that perennial communications 
              problem we all love to hate.&nbsp; H. H.&nbsp; Mukunda Goswami and 
              Krsna Dharma Dasa have joined forces to help us understand the dynamics 
              of getting through to 'Joe Public', and how to address his concerns 
              and needs with practical, Krsna conscious solutions</i>.&nbsp;</span> 
            </p>
            <p align=left><b>H. H. Mukunda Goswami</b>: In spreading Krsna consciousness 
              we find that throughout the world there are three things that we 
              need to establish in order to gain public support, attract followers 
              and sell the idea of Krsna consciousness - in short, to be successful 
              in propagating Krsna consciousness.&nbsp; We propagate these different 
              messages at different times according to time, place and circumstance.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p align=left>The first is authenticity.&nbsp; Who are we?&nbsp; What 
              are we?&nbsp; Are we part of an old tradition?&nbsp; Are we something 
              new?&nbsp; Very often, even in interfaith conferences, we are characterised 
              as a new religion and that is a definition we often have to fight.&nbsp; 
              What is the size?&nbsp; What is the scope?&nbsp; What is our philosophical 
              background?&nbsp; Are we truly authentic - do we have a book of 
              knowledge?&nbsp; So authenticity is very important.</p>
            <p align=left>Prabhupada sometimes said that Krsna consciousness was 
              a cultural movement.&nbsp; So our cultural richness should also 
              be considered important.&nbsp; I remember when I was getting Srila 
              Prabhupada immigration into the United States.&nbsp; There was a 
              special form to fill out if the person felt they could contribute 
              something culturally, as an artist, a musician, a performer&nbsp; 
              or architect etc.&nbsp; So cultural&nbsp; richness - paintings, 
              architecture, music, dance, drama,&nbsp; literature and food - are 
              things people find very important and see as contributing to the 
              so-called culture of modern society. Lastly is social responsibility 
              - being seen to contribute to, or improve, the quality of life.</p>
            <p align=left>All these things are all going on simultaneously.&nbsp; 
              We constantly have to teach people why and how we are authentic, 
              expose them to our culture - <i>harinam</i>, deity worship,<i> prasadam 
              - </i>and display our social responsibility.</p>
            <p align="left"> In this essay we would like to focus on&nbsp; social 
              responsibility, which is an element which we have perhaps not really 
              thought about very much as a society.&nbsp; How we are improving 
              the quality of life? People want to know what we have to offer, 
              how they are going to benefit.&nbsp; When they see that we are contributing 
              towards the welfare of the individual, family, community, society, 
              nation and the world as a whole, that is the beginning of recognising 
              the social responsibility of our movement.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">We have already consulted people who have had many 
              years of experience helping non profit-making organisations get 
              their messages across to the public.&nbsp; Myself, Anuttama and 
              some other devotees recently spent several days working out a Universal 
              Mission Statement (UMS) for ISKCON Communications.&nbsp; It is not 
              a UMS for ISKCON in general&nbsp; although it could, or may be, 
              in the future, but a statement to develop the idea of social responsibility.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p align=left> When Prabhupada was in Rome in 1974, he asked devotees 
              to write a book called <i>How Krsna Consciousness Can Solve All 
              The Problems of Life</i>.&nbsp; Looking through the transcripts 
              of Srila Prabhupada's conversations, one can find at least twenty 
              instances where he says that Krsna consciousness solves all the 
              problems of the world - very clear statements.&nbsp; In fact, he 
              asked the devotees to bring a new problem to him each day.&nbsp; 
              One day, Prabhupada talked about how Krsna consciousness can solve 
              the crime problem.&nbsp; On another, he talked about the oil crisis 
              in the Gulf.&nbsp; Various social problems, such as drugs, were 
              also discussed, with Srila Prabhupada offering the spiritual solution 
              in every case.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align=left> Inspired by this, we did try to put together a book.&nbsp; 
              There is a section in <i>The Science Of Self-Realisation </i>headed 
              'Spiritual Solutions to Material Problems'.&nbsp; This featured 
              a classic conversation Prabhupada had with Lieutenant Mozee of the 
              Chicago Police Department, where he outlined ways in which Krsna 
              consciousness could solve the crime problem.&nbsp; In another conversation 
              on the same theme, with Jackie Vaughan, Michigan State Senator, 
              Vaughan is reported to have said to Prabhupada, 'I am completely 
              convinced that this is not simply theoretical and that this movement 
              can solve all problems of life'.</p>
            <p align=left> There are different levels on which these problems 
              are solved.&nbsp; Firstly, there is directly perceived evidence 
              - <i>pratyaksha</i> .&nbsp; We can see on a personal level how Krsna 
              consciousness leads to a reduction in stress levels, a healthier 
              diet and greater inner peace.&nbsp; Secondly, there is hypothetical 
              evidence, or a<i>numana</i>.&nbsp; For example, if everyone is individually 
              peaceful then logically the whole world could become peaceful.&nbsp; 
              Lastly, there are the authoritative statements, or <i>shabda</i>, 
              which tell us that the whole world will become peaceful by Krsna 
              consciousness.&nbsp; This is illustrated in scriptures such as the 
              <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>, which says that if you water the root 
              of the tree all the branches and twigs will be nourished. There 
              are many other such statements which speak about how Krsna consciousness 
              can solve all problems.</p>
            <p align=left>We are preaching on all three levels, according to time 
              place and circumstance.&nbsp; Some solutions are directly obvious; 
              others sound possible; and there are those which are purely scriptural 
              injunctions.&nbsp; For example, the statement that cow dung is useful 
              as a fertiliser and cleanser , or that bone is impure but the conchshell, 
              which is bone, is considered pure.&nbsp; Srila Prabhupada stressed 
              that Vedic knowledge is always pure and perfect; even though it 
              may appear contradictory in places, it is still the best, highest 
              and most perfect knowledge.&nbsp; We will briefly discuss these 
              different ways of approaching the various problems - putting forward 
              immediate, obvious solutions; presenting possible solutions for 
              argument, and those that just have to be taken on faith. </p>
            <p align=left>The problems given in the Universal Mission Statement 
              are immense and perhaps, some day, whole books will be written about 
              how Krsna Consciousness will solve each one of these.&nbsp; In fact, 
              the Bhaktivedanta Institute have just completed an eight hundred 
              page book called <i>Forbidden Archeology </i>, which deals with 
              the mechanistic worldview.&nbsp; It is already meeting with some 
              success even though it has only been out a few weeks.&nbsp; The 
              book aims to make even the most sceptical or athestic person question 
              the popular belief that the world is a dead place, run automatically 
              according to some mechanistic laws, rather than under the control 
              of God.&nbsp; Not only will books be written, but there might even 
              be colleges or institutions devoted to tackling each one of these 
              problems, just as the Bhaktivedanta Institute exists just to solve 
              the problem of the mechanistic worldview using the Krsna Consciousness 
              philosophy.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align=left>So let us now look at the Universal Mission Statement 
              and how the Krsna conscious philosophy can be applied.</p>
            <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
            <p align=left><b> Krsna Dharma: </b>First of all ,I would like to

              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left">I would like to try and present this Universal Mission 
              Statement using Srila Prabhupada's instructions as well as my own 
              experiences.</p>
            <p align=left>Of course, everyone is trying to solve the problems 
              of life and, as we know, human life is meant for making a permanent 
              solution to these problems. In his books, Prabhupada refers again 
              and again to four particular problems with which all of us are familiar: 
              <i>janma,</i> <i>mrityu, jara, vyadi </i>- birth, death, old age 
              and disease.&nbsp; Every kind of human endeavour is more or less 
              directed towards trying to bring about a solution to one of these 
              problems.&nbsp; Immediately we are born we need to find a facility 
              for survival and for avoiding the miseries of this world - and that 
              struggle never ends.</p>
            <p align=left> Thus everyone is trying to find some kind of improvement 
              or gain in their life.&nbsp; This is known as <i>artha</i> in Sanskrit 
              - some gain or result to one's endeavour.&nbsp; The Vedic injunction 
              is <i>jijnasu sreya uttama -</i> we should look for the ultimate 
              solution to life's problems.&nbsp; And that is discovered when you 
              approach a bona fide guru. <i>Tasmad guru prapadyeta jigyasu sreya</i> 
              <i>uttamam</i>: you enquire from him and he gives you the answer&nbsp; 
              which is, of course, that you become Krsna conscious, give up material 
              activities <i>in toto</i>, don't get any more reactions (good or 
              bad) for your activities and go back to Godhead.&nbsp; This is the 
              essential message of the Krsna consciousness movement.&nbsp; We 
              are saying that if you simply chant the maha mantra and serve, worship 
              and surrender to Krsna - <i>Krsna bhakti kaila sarva karma krta 
              hoy</i> - everything is taken care of or, as Prabhupada says, 'Everything 
              is carried'.&nbsp; Now the question may be: why is there any need 
              then for us to do or say anything else?&nbsp; Let's simply go out 
              and spread this core message of the Hare Krsna movement 'Just chant 
              Hare Krsna and be happy'. We are not saying 'don't do that'.&nbsp; 
              The message here is, yes, we want to transmit the core message of 
              ISKCON, we want to tell people 'chant Hare Krsna, worship Krsna, 
              take Krsna <i>prasadam</i>, go back to Godhead'.&nbsp; But&nbsp; 
              we encounter problems - people don't want to do, or accept, that.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p align=left> I have personally experienced frustration, as I know 
              many of you will have done, when trying to preach the message of 
              Krsna consciousness.&nbsp; I've been speaking to an individual and 
              clearly they've got problems and I know I've got the answer in the 
              shape of Krsna consciousness, but I'm not able to convince him.&nbsp; 
              I'm telling him 'Look, just chant Hare Krsna,' and he is looking 
              at me and thinking, 'Not practical, it could never work.&nbsp; Maybe 
              it's working for you but my problems are so complex, there are so 
              many things in my life to sort out. How could chanting be of any 
              use to me?'&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a communications problem here 
              - I'm not getting through.</p>
            <p align=left> What we are talking about here is how to relate Krsna 
              consciousness to specific needs.&nbsp; Everyone has a need in their 
              life.&nbsp; Ultimately we know that need is Krsna, so we have to 
              somehow show that to people.</p>
            <p align=left> Now, I do not know if any of you have looked at the 
              techniques of selling, but there are certain tried and tested methods 
              by which you can sell anything.&nbsp; So let us take Krsna Consciousness 
              as our product.&nbsp; First of all, we have to approach the materialist, 
              or the prospect as they say in sales jargon, and convince him to 
              buy our product.&nbsp; Salesmen use a well-known method called 'AIDA':&nbsp; 
              Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.&nbsp; In order to explain, 
              let us use this idea in relation to the book distributor.&nbsp; 
              What do you do when you try to sell a book?&nbsp; First thing is 
              attract attention: 'Excuse me sir, excuse me, please stop a moment.'&nbsp; 
              So you stop someone.&nbsp; 'Hello, my name is Krsna Dasa and I am 
              here to show you some beautiful books today.' The next thing is, 
              'I would like you to look at one of these', and you give him a book.&nbsp; 
              You try to grab his interest by putting the book in his hand, and 
              he looks at it.&nbsp; Now, you have to get him to the next stage 
              - desire.&nbsp; You have to make him desire the product.&nbsp; He 
              has got it in his hand, he is probably thinking 'Do I really need 
              this?&nbsp; What is it anyway?&nbsp; <i>Srimad . </i>?&nbsp; Bhaga 
              <i>. </i>?'&nbsp; He probably can't even read the title and he does 
              not know what it is about.&nbsp; You have got to convince him to 
              buy it and you do not have much time to do this, he is about to 
              give it back.&nbsp; Now using all your expertise you try to bring 
              him to the point of desire. You try to understand the particular 
              need of that man.&nbsp; If you are an expert salesman you will draw 
              it out from him by asking the right questions, and then you relate 
              the product to this need. He starts thinking, 'Hey! I'm looking 
              for something like this.&nbsp; This is what I want.'&nbsp; That 
              is the point of desire, when he starts feeling like that: he buys, 
              you should not sell.&nbsp; Expert salesmanship means that people 
              buy without feeling 'sold'. </p>
            <p align=left>Each selling process goes through these four basic constituents. 
              This can be done 'one-to-one' on the street or at the door, or on 
              a larger scale.&nbsp; Indeed, it is necessary to have this kind 
              of support for men in the field.&nbsp; It is extremely difficult 
              on a first encounter to take a prospect from having no knowledge 
              of the product to realising it will satisfy his particular needs. 
              Successful companies will always carry out some preliminary marketing 
              by increasing product awareness and stimulating interest.&nbsp; 
              The salesman just goes in and closes the deal.</p>
            <p align=left>There are different kinds of needs and problems which 
              are prevalent in society according to time, place and circumstance, 
              and to which we can relate Krsna consciousness.&nbsp; Believe it 
              on not, a major problem in many Western countries today is poverty.&nbsp; 
              There are so many beggars on the street, so many people who are 
              hungry in the so-called affluent West, it is gradually becoming 
              like the third world.&nbsp; There is a growing feature of degradation, 
              deprivation and poverty in Manchester, which is where I preach.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              The idea is that we present Krsna consciousness in such a way that 
              it is recognised as directly addressing this particular need.&nbsp; 
              If I go to these needy individuals and say 'I see you are lying 
              there on the street and you are hungry, but just chant Hare Krsna 
              and everything will be okay,' they are probably going to say 'I'm 
              hungry, what about some food?'&nbsp; But if I go to them with Krsna 
              <i>prasadam</i>, as with the Food For Life programme, they can relate 
              to that.&nbsp; 'Yes, this is something I need.'&nbsp; And, of course, 
              we can gradually introduce more Krsna consciousness.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align=left>By this method we are trying to create environments 
              which are favourable to the transmission of the core Krsna conscious 
              message, which is the product which they are not ready to take, 
              which they do not understand that they need.&nbsp; We have to create 
              that understanding in them.&nbsp; Perhaps we can think of possible 
              programmes which could demonstrate how Krsna Consciousness specifically 
              applies itself to solving certain problems, such as Food For Life.&nbsp; 
              That is the <i>pratyaksa</i> element - the practical evidence of 
              Krsna consciousness working.&nbsp; We can also think of different 
              arguments why ultimately one has to be God conscious in order to 
              solve a particular problem (<i>anumana)</i>.&nbsp; I have done some 
              research into the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> and have extracted statements 
              from Srila Prabhupada on most of the problems found on the UMS list. 
              Of course, he is always saying 'chant Hare Krsna and be happy', 
              but he also gives more specific and detailed solutions.&nbsp; For 
              example, in the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>&nbsp; Prabhupada referred 
              to 'government' 256 times, so we can understand he is interested 
              in governing society.&nbsp; The Krsna Consciousness movement is 
              not just saying 'Let's forget the whole thing.&nbsp; The world is 
              a mess and a place of misery, let us just go back to Godhead. Just 
              leave it, there is no hope.'&nbsp; Perhaps we may find the occasional 
              statement that supports that idea. But the fact is, the material 
              world exists for the rectification of the conditioned souls so they 
              will go back to Godhead, and in order for this to be achieved there 
              has to be a proper functioning society.&nbsp; Of course, all these 
              problems would be solved in a proper <i>varnasrama</i> society, 
              but maybe that is something for the future. Certainly Srila Prabhupada 
              did not want us the forget this world: again, in the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>, 
              there are 150 specific references to leadership. 'Leadership should 
              be this, leaders should do that, a leader should always act like 
              this.'&nbsp; Prabhupada is again and again making these points so 
              clearly he wanted us to get involved with the managing of society.&nbsp; 
              We have to show that we are able to do that, especially in our actions 
              and, of course, in our preaching.&nbsp; Usually we are expert at 
              presenting the argument but when it comes to its practical application&nbsp; 
              - well, we may still have some way to go.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align=left>In this way, our preaching approach is related to the 
              concerns of the particular audience, to whatever wavelength they 
              are on, which will depend upon the time and place.&nbsp; For example, 
              the poverty in Manchester.&nbsp; In Sweden they do not have such 
              a problem with poverty due to their excellent welfare system, but 
              they have much stress and anxiety, and the suicide rate is very 
              high.&nbsp; We could therefore show how Krsna Consciousness directly 
              addresses this problem, perhaps by offering 'mantra therapy' or 
              'anxiety free food', etc.</p>
            <p align=left>We thus take the solution from the personal level on 
              which we are trying to attract people, back to Krsna again.&nbsp; 
              In the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> there is a generic quote that can 
              perhaps be applied to this whole exercise, in the last of the four 
              seed verses: 'A person who is searching after the Supreme Absolute 
              Truth, the Personality of Godhead, must certainly search for it 
              up to this in all circumstances, in all space, in all time and both 
              directly and indirectly.'&nbsp; Although we may initially view the 
              solution to a problem from a material perspective, it must be ultimately 
              be directed towards Krsna.&nbsp; That is the real expertise which 
              we will have to develop and display.&nbsp; In the purport to that 
              verse Srila Prabhupada writes:&nbsp; ' . one who is developed in 
              consciousness certainly makes enquiries into the mystery of the 
              self, the cosmic situation, and of the problems of life, in all 
              spheres and fields, social, political, economic, cultural, religious, 
              moral, etc, and, in their different branches.&nbsp; But here the 
              goal of all such enquiries is explained ... .'&nbsp; In other words, 
              we should make enquiries into these specific areas, but must always 
              keep the goal in mind. We may formulate programmes addressing specific 
              needs, but even those programmes can incorporate the core aspect 
              of our preaching such as Food For Life.&nbsp; Or, as I suggested 
              above, we might devise a programme for suicidal cases incorporating 
              sessions of chanting.&nbsp; In this way, we are still undertaking 
              our main preaching activities.&nbsp; Whatever we do will, of course, 
              incorporate one or more of the three main limbs of our preaching, 
              but in such an expert way that it is accepted by people.&nbsp; They 
              feel that 'yes this is what we are looking for, this is what we 
              need.'&nbsp;&nbsp; From this initial step, we gradually take them 
              higher and higher, right up to the point of ultimate enquiry.&nbsp; 
              There is a further reference in the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i> which 
              supports this: 'A<i>vicyuta-arth</i>' (the infallible purpose).&nbsp; 
              In the purport to that verse, Srila Prabhupada refers to social, 
              political, religious and psychological knowledge, but emphasises 
              that the infallible purpose of the study of all these culminates 
              in the glorification of the Supreme Lord: '<i>tad uttamashloka gunarnavarnam</i>'. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">Therefore spiritual solutions to material problems 
              does not conflict with the core mission of ISKCON, but rather facilitates 
              it by creating an environment where people can recognise that Krsna 
              consciousness is the ultimate solution to their problems.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p align=left><b> Mukunda Goswami:&nbsp; </b>'Spiritual solutions' 
              goes beyond acceptance of ISKCON by society, which is sometimes 
              all we are trying to obtain.&nbsp; But we do not want to just be 
              tolerated.&nbsp; In the UK&nbsp; there is this idea that 'well we 
              can tolerate these Muslims, blacks or whatever they may be, even 
              though we don't like them'.&nbsp; However, Srila Prabhupada expected 
              ISKCON to be a movement for change in society.&nbsp; By preaching 
              in this way, we begin to see that society is able to do more than 
              just tolerate us.&nbsp; It is one thing to be accepted, but if we 
              are doing something that benefits society then the next step is 
              appreciation.&nbsp; In fact Srila Prabhupada said that society would 
              hate, then laugh at and finally adore us - so these developments 
              are moving us towards the level of appreciation and adoration.</p>
            <p align=left>Developing our society means a high level of participation 
              and energy, with people putting in their time and money.&nbsp; The 
              purpose of going beyond acceptance, and being seen as an organisation 
              that is benefitting society, is to create an environment in which 
              people feel they want to participate and are proud to be doing something 
              for ISKCON.&nbsp; This is the way in which such an environment is 
              created, maintained and increased, providing a foundation in which 
              more and more people can become involved.&nbsp; There are many people 
              who would get involved but who think 'I do not understand this and 
              nothing really good for society is happening here, they are just 
              into their own thing'.&nbsp; However, if we demonstrate that something 
              important is happening which is of benefit to people then involvement 
              will increase and increase.</p>
            <p align=left>I want to encourage each of you when giving classes, 
              preaching one-on-one or in a small group in peoples' homes, to raise 
              some of these points.&nbsp; You will find that a lot of things you 
              have read about in Prabhupada's books or heard in lectures will 
              come out and that there is a great wealth of knowledge in preaching 
              this way. </p>
