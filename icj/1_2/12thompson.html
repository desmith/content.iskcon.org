              Thompson, Ph.D.</a> </h2>

            <p style='text-align:left'>In Vivekananda Svami's famous lecture on 

              Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions in 1893, he began by outlining 

              some of the salient features of traditional Hinduism. He mentioned 

              reincarnation, karma and the problem of evil in the material world. 

              He went on to explain that the solution to this problem depends 

              on seeking refuge in God. God is that one 'by whose command the 

              wind blows, the fire burns, the clouds rain, and death stalks upon 

              the earth.'<a name="_ednref1"></a><a

href="#_edn1" title="">[1]</a> He is source of strength and the support of the 

              universe. He is everywhere, pure, almighty, and all-merciful. We 

              are related to God as a child to a father or mother and as a friend 

              to a beloved friend. </p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>Vivekananda said that we should worship 

              God through unselfish love and pointed out that the way to achieving 

              love of God was, 'fully developed and taught by Krsna, whom the 

              Hindus believe to have been God incarnate on earth.<a name="_ednref2"></a><a

href="#_edn2" title="">[2]</a><sup> </sup>Through love we are to perfect ourselves, 

              reach God, see God, and enjoy bliss with God and that on this all 

              Hindus are agreed.'<a name="_ednref3"></a><a

href="#_edn3" title="">[3]</a><sup> </sup>However, he went on to say that in the 

              final stage of realisation, God is seen to be impersonal Brahman 

              and the individual terminates its separate existence by realising 

              its identity with Brahman. Making an analogy with physical science 

              he commented, 'Physics would stop when it would be able to fulfil 

              its services in discovering one energy of which all the others are 

              but manifestations, and the science of religion (would) become perfect 

              when it would discover . One who is the only Soul of which all souls 

              are but delusive manifestations.'<a name="_ednref4"></a><a href="#_edn4" title="">[4]</a></p>

            <p> <b>The advantages and disadvantages of pure monism</b></p>

            Vivekananda's strictly monistic concept of God has a long history 

            and it has always been associated with the rational, speculative approach 

            to reality. For example, in the fifth century <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>BC</span> 

            the Greek philosopher Parmenides concluded by speculative arguments 

            that 'only One Thing can possibly exist and that this One Thing is 

            uncreated, unchangeable, indestructible, and immovable. Plurality, 

            creation, change, destruction, and motion are mere appearances.'<a

name="_ednref5"></a><a href="#_edn5" title="">[5]</a> Parmenides argued that the 

            One must have no parts distinct from one another, otherwise it would 

            be not One but many. He concluded that the One must be a sphere of 

            perfectly uniform substance. But even a sphere has an inside and an 

            outside, and so it is characterised by duality, not oneness. The idea 

            of absolute oneness, or pure monism, may seem alluring but it requires 

            us to give up all conceivable attributes and finally give up thought 

            and conceptualisation itself. 

            <p class=MsoBodyText>Vivekananda recognised this problem and he argued 

              that in Hindu philosophy specific forms of gods and goddesses serve 

              as symbols to help us visualise the inconceivable. Thus he said, 

              &quot;The Hindus have discovered that the absolute can only be realised, 

              or thought of, or stated, through the relative, and the images, 

              crosses, and crescents are simply so many symbols, so many pegs 

              to hang the spiritual ideas on.'<a name="_ednref6"></a><a

href="#_edn6" title="">[6]</a></p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>The idea of religious imagery as a symbol 

              for the inconceivable absolute has some useful applications in the 

              modern age. Vivekananda was born in Calcutta in 1863 as Narendranath 

              Datta, and he grew up during the high noon of British dominance 

              in India. During this period European rationalism, based on the 

              famous French Enlightenment, made a strong impact on India. Reformers 

              like Rammohan Roy and Devendranath Tagore founded the Brahma Samaj 

              in an effort to revise Hinduism and make it compatible with modern 

              Western thinking.<a name="_ednref7"></a><a

href="#_edn7" title="">[7]</a><sup> </sup>This effort required solving two problems: 

              (1) religious plurality, (2) the incompatibility between modern 

              science and old religious beliefs.</p>

            The old philosophy of pure monism, or <i>advaita</i><u>,</u> is well 

            suited to solve these problems. First of all, if religious imagery 

            has only a symbolical meaning that refers to something inconceivable 

            then many different systems of symbols should work equally well for 

            this purpose. In this way, all major religious systems can be reconciled 

            with one another. This was Vivekananda's idea, and he greatly stressed 

            the equality of all religions. Likewise, if religious imagery is simply 

            symbolical then there is no question of a conflict between religion 

            and science. A religious story that seems to conflict with established 

            scientific facts can simply be interpreted as a symbolic representation 

            of the One lying beyond the grasp of the finite scientific mind. In 

            addition, Vivekananda pointed out that the stark simplicity of the 

            impersonal Brahman is compatible with the simplicity that physicists 

            seek in their hoped-for Grand Unified Theory of nature. But in pure 

            monism what becomes of love of God, or indeed, love of anyone? If 

            the ultimate reality is undifferentiated oneness, and personal existence 

            is illusory, then love is also illusory. Love requires two, and not 

            just two of anything. Two persons are required for a relationship 

            of love. If such relationships actually have spiritual reality then 

            there must exist at least two eternally existing spiritual personalities. 

            In traditional Hindu thought there are, in fact, two categories of 

            eternal persons: (1) the <i>jiva </i>souls that inhabit individual 

            material bodies, (2) the original Supreme Personality of Godhead and 

            His innumerable spiritual expansions. As Vivekananda pointed out, 

            Hindus believe that the Supreme Being incarnated on earth as Krsna, 

            Who expounded the principles of loving devotional reciprocation between 

            Himself and individual <i>jiva</i> souls. Unfortunately, after making 

            this point, Vivekananda rejected both Krsna and the individual soul 

            as illusion. According to his monistic approach to religion, all conceivable 

            features of the Absolute are ruled out. Beingness, knowledge and bliss 

            are three, and they must be discarded from the One as earthbound misconceptions. 

            The same is true of the might and mercy of the Lord. Likewise, all 

            relationships of personal reciprocation admiration, friendship, parental 

            or conjugal love must be given up as delusions if the real truth is 

            absolute oneness. 

            <p> <b>The Vaisnava alternative given by Bhaktivinode Thakura</b></p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>It is therefore natural to ask if some other 

              solution is available to the spiritual problems posed by modern 

              rational thought and the multiplicity of religious systems. To explore 

              this possibility, I now turn to the life of BhaktivinodeThakura, 

              a contemporary of Svami Vivekananda.</p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>Bhaktivinode Thakurawas born in 1838 as Kedaranath 

              Datta in the Nadia district of West Bengal. As a young man he acquired 

              an English education, and he often exchanged thoughts on literary 

              and spiritual topics with Devendranath Tagore, the Brahma Samaj 

              leader and early teacher of Vivekananda. In due course, he studied 

              law, and for many years supported his family as a magistrate in 

              the British court system.</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>Bhaktivinode Thakura deeply studied the 

              religious thought of his day. He scrutinised the works of European 

              philosophers and he was greatly impressed with the devotional teachings 

              of Jesus Christ. At first, his Western education inclined him to 

              look down on the Vaisnava literature describing devotional service 

              to the Supreme Lord, Krsna. Indeed, he wrote that the <i>Bhagavat</i><u>,</u> 

              one of the main texts describing Krsna, 'seemed like a repository 

              of ideas scarcely adopted to the nineteenth century.'<a name="_ednref8"></a><a href="#_edn8" title="">[8]</a></p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>However, at a certain point he read about 

              the great Vaisnava reformer Lord Caitanya, and he was able to obtain 

              Lord Caitanya's commentary on the <i>Bhagavat</i> given to the <i>advaita 

              </i>Vedantists of Benares. This created in him a great love for 

              the devotional teachings of Krsna as presented by Caitanya.<a

name="_ednref9"></a><a href="#_edn9" title="">[9]</a> Eventually he achieved an 

              exalted state of spiritual realisation by following Lord Caitanya's 

              teachings and wrote many books presenting these teachings to various 

              classes of people, both in India and abroad.</p>

            <p> <b>A historical interlude</b></p>

            Before discussing Bhaktivinode Thakura's spiritual teachings it will 

            be useful to give an explicit idea of the intellectual climate in 

            which he was operating in late nineteenth-century Bengal. To do this, 

            I will quote a passage from the writings of Sir William Jones, a jurist 

            who worked for the British East India company and was the first president 

            of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In an article on Hindu chronology 

            written in 1788, Jones gave the following account of the close of 

            <i>Dvapara-yuga</i>, the third age in the chronology of the <i>Puranas 

            </i>and the <i>Mahabharata</i><u>:</u> I cannot leave the third Indian 

            age in which the virtues and vices of mankind are said to have been 

            equal, without observing, that even the close of it is manifestly 

            fabulous and poetical, with hardly more appearance of historical truth, 

            than the tale of Troy<u>,</u> or of the Argonauts; for Yudhisthira, 

            it seems, was the son of Dherma, the Genius of Justice<u>;</u> Bhima 

            of Pavan, or the God of Wind<u>;</u> Arjun of Indra, or the Firmament; 

            Nacul and Sahadeva of the Cumars, the Castor and Pollux of India; 

            and Bhishma, their reputed great uncle, was the child of Ganga, or 

            the Ganges, by Santanu, whose brother Devapi is supposed to be still 

            alive in the city of Calapa; all which fictions may be charming embellishments 

            of an heroic poem, but are just as absurd in civil history, as the 

            descent of two royal families from the Sun and the Moon.<a name="_ednref10"></a><a

href="#_edn10" title="">[10]</a> What Jones is referring to here is the story 

            in the <i>Mahabharata </i>of the events occurring in India at the 

            time of Krsna's advent. According to Hindu tradition these events 

            took place about five thousand years ago, at the time when the <i>Dvapara-yuga</i> 

            gave way to the present epoch, the <i>Kali-yuga</i>. Yudhisthira, 

            Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva are the five Pandava brothers 

            who appeared in many of Krsna's pastimes. 

            <p class=MsoBodyText>We can see from Jones's comments that he does 

              not regard the story of the Pandavas as true history. Why not? For 

              many of us the problem is that the story contains elements that 

              are simply not credible to a person trained in the modern rational 

              viewpoint. We know that people don't descend from demigods. All 

              documents containing such nonsense are rejected by responsible historians 

              and consequently objective historical accounts do not contain such 

              absurdities. Such things never happened and our history books abundantly 

              confirm this. Jones was clearly thinking along these lines but he 

              was not exactly a modern rationalist. Jones was a Christian who 

              believed fully in the Mosaic chronology based on the <i>Bible</i>. 

              Table 1 shows how Jones attempted to reconstruct Hindu chronology 

              so as to bring it in line with Christian chronology. It appears 

              that Jones was able to scorn Hindu mythology as palpably absurd, 

              while at the same time accepting as true the supernatural events 

              recorded in the <i>Bible</i>.</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>It is perhaps poetic justice that the same 

              scornful treatment that Jones applied to the <i>Mahabharata </i>was 

              soon applied to the <i>Bible</i>. During Jones's lifetime, the 'higher' 

              scientific criticism of the <i>Bible</i> was being developed in 

              Germany and it was unleashed in England in the mid-nineteenth century. 

              In 1860, the Anglican theologians Benjamin Jowett and Baden Powell 

              stole attention from Darwin's newly published book <i>On the Origin 

              of Species</i> by a controversial essay that rejected miracles on 

              scientific grounds. <a

name="_ednref12"></a><a href="#_edn12" title="">[12]</a> The Darwinists and the 

              higher Biblical critics quickly joined forces, and Darwin's supporter 

              Thomas Huxley began quoting German Biblical scholars in his essays 

              on the interpretation of <i>Genesis</i>.<a name="_ednref13"></a><a

href="#_edn13" title="">[13]</a> As the nineteenth century drew to a close rational, 

              scientific scepticism became the only acceptable path for a scholar 

              or intellectual in any respectable field of study.</p>

            <i> <b>The Bhagavat</b></i> 

            <p class=MsoBodyText>Bhaktivinode Thakura was confronted with this 

              hostile intellectual climate in his efforts to present spiritual 

              knowledge to the young Bengali intellectuals of his day. After imbibing 

              the ideas of William Jones and other Western orientalists from their 

              British teachers, these young people were not at all inclined to 

              give credence to old mythology. How then could the teachings of 

              Krsna on love of God be presented? Bhaktivinode Thakura judiciously 

              chose to give a partial presentation of the truth which would introduce 

              important spiritual ideas without invoking rejection due to deep-seated 

              prejudices.</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>In a lecture delivered in Dinajpur, West 

              Bengal in 1869, he strongly stressed the <i>Bhagavat</i><u>,</u>

              the nature of the Supreme and the means of realising our relation 

              with the Supreme. Rejecting pure monism as a useless idea, he pointed 

              out that God is an eternal person: 'The <i><u>B</u>hagavat </i>has 

              ... a Transcendental, Personal, All-intelligent, Active, absolutely 

              Free, Holy, Good, All-powerful, Omnipresent, Just and Merciful and 

              supremely Spiritual Deity without a second, creating, preserving 

              all that is in the universe.'<a name="_ednref14"></a><a

href="#_edn14" title="">[14]</a> He believed the highest object of the soul was 

              to 'serve that Infinite Being for ever spiritually in the activity 

              of Absolute Love.'<a name="_ednref15"></a><a

href="#_edn15" title="">[15]</a></p>

            Bhaktivinode described the material world as the product of <i>maya 

            </i>(the eternal energy of the Supreme which He uses to bewilder those 

            souls who do not desire to live in harmony with Him). The creation 

            of the material world through <i>maya</i> is actually an aspect of 

            the Lord's mercy since He thereby allows independent-minded souls 

            to carry out their activities in a world from which God is apparently 

            absent. All these ideas are taken from the <i>Bhagavat </i>without 

            modification. However, in describing what the <i>Bhagavat</i> says 

            about the details of the material universe, Bhaktivinode Thakura adopted 

            an indirect approach: 

            <p style='text-align:left'>In the common-place books of the Hindu 

              religion in which the Raja and Tama Gunas have been described as 

              the ways of religion, we find description of a local heaven and 

              a local hell; the heaven is as beautiful as anything on earth and 

              the Hell as ghastly as any picture of evil ... The religion of the 

              <i>Bhagavat </i>is free from such a poetic imagination. Indeed, 

              in some of the chapters we meet with descriptions of these hells 

              and heavens, and accounts of curious tales, but we have been warned 

              in some place in the book not to accept them as real facts but to 

              treat them as inventions to overawe the wicked and to improve the 

              simple and the ignorant.<a name="_ednref16"></a><a href="#_edn16" title="">[16]</a></p>

            In fact, the <i>Bhagavat </i>does ascribe reality to hells and heavens 

            and their inhabitants. It describes in great detail the higher planetary 

            systems and the various demigods who live there including Brahma, 

            Siva, and Indra. Not only does the <i>Bhagavat </i>say that these 

            beings are real, but it gives them an important role in the creation 

            and maintenance of the universe as well as appearing in many of Krsna's 

            manifest pastimes (<i>lilas)</i> within the material world. For example, 

            in the story of the lifting of Govardhana Hill, it is Indra who creates 

            a devastating storm when Krsna insults him by interfering with a sacrifice 

            in his honour. 

            <p style='text-align:left'>Nonetheless, Bhaktivinode Thakura chose 

              to side-step these 'mythological' aspects of the <i>Bhagavat </i>in 

              an effort to reach an audience of intellectuals whose mundane education 

              ruled out such mythology as absurd fantasy. Indeed, he went even 

              further than this. In 1880 he published a treatise entitled <i>Sri 

              Krsna Samhita</i> in which he elaborately explained the philosophy 

              of Krsna consciousness.<a

name="_ednref17"></a><a href="#_edn17" title="">[17]</a><sup> </sup>In this book 

              he also presented a reconstruction of Indian history similar to 

              the one introduced by Sir William Jones to bring Hindu chronology 

              into line with the Mosaic timetable of the <i>Bible</i> (see Table 

              1). This involved converting demigods and Manus into human kings 

              and reducing their total span of history to a few thousand earthly 

              years. </p>

            I should clearly point out that Bhaktivinode Thakura did not personally 

            accept the modified version of the <i>Bhagavat </i>presented to the 

            Bengali intellectuals, but rather accepted the so-called mythology 

            of the <i>Bhagavat </i>as true. He presented it as such in many of 

            his writings, for example <i>Jaiva Dharma</i><u>:</u> 

            <p class=MsoBlockText> I have said that the Vaisnava religion came 

              into being as soon as the creatures came into existence. Brahma 

              was the first Vaisnava. Sriman Mahadeva is also a Vaisnava. The 

              ancient Prajapaties are all Vaisnavas. Sri Narada Goswami who is 

              the fancy-born child of Brahma, is a Vaisnava ... You have seen 

              the Vaisnava religion of the beginning of the creation. Then again 

              when Gods, men, demons, etc., have been separately described, we 

              get Prahlada and Dhruva from the very start ... Manu's sons and 

              Prahlada are all grandsons of Prajapati, Kashyapa ... There is no 

              doubt about it ... that the pure Vaisnava religion began with the 

              beginning of history. Then the kings of the solar and lunar dynasties 

              and all great and famous sages and hermits became devotees of Vishnu.<a name="_ednref18"></a><a

            This passage was written in response to challengers who argue that 

            Vaisnava dharma is a recent development. The passage presumes that 

            beings such as Brahma, Mahadeva, Narada and Prahlada literally exist 

            as described in the <i>sastras</i>. Many similar examples of this 

            can be found in Bhaktivinode Thakura's writings. 

            <p style='text-align:left'>If Bhaktivinode Thakura accepted the literal 

              truth of the <i>sastras</i><u>,</u> how could he justify making 

              presentations in which he denied it? His grand-disciple Srila A. 

              C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada has pointed out that there is 

              a precedent for making such indirect presentations of <i>sastra</i><u>.</u> 

              An interpretation of a text which adheres directly to the dictionary 

              definitions of its words is called <i>mukhya-vrtti</i><u>,</u> whereas 

              an imaginary or indirect interpretation is known as <i>laksana-vrtti</i> 

              or <i>gauna-vrtti</i><u>.</u> Srila Prabhupada pointed out: 'Sometimes 

              . as a matter of necessity, Vedic literature is described in terms 

              of the <i>laksana-vrtti</i> or <i>gauna-vrtti,</i> but one should 

              not accept such explanations as permanent truths.'<a

name="_ednref19"></a><a href="#_edn19" title="">[19]</a> In general, therefore, 

              one should understand <i>sastra</i> in terms of <i>mukhya-vrtti<u>.</u> 

              </i></p>

            <p> <b>The theology of visions</b></p>

            One might accept that Bhaktivinode Thakura was justified in modifying 

            the <i>sastras</i> in an effort to reach intellectuals trained to 

            scorn old mythology, but serious questions still need to be raised: 

            what is the scope for making such a presentation of religion today 

            and to what extent can such a presentation be regarded as true? Could 

            it be that the mythological material in the Hindu <i>sastras</i> is 

            unimportant, so that one might present it as true to people who believe 

            in it and as false to people who don't? Or should we accept, on the 

            basis of modern knowledge, that Hindu mythology really is false and 

            try to formulate a philosophy that preserves the essential idea of 

            love of God while dispensing with superannuated ideas? 

            <p style='text-align:left' align="left"> To answer these questions, 

              let us see how we would have reformulate Vaisnava philosophy so 

              as to make it readily acceptable to intellectuals today in late 

              twentieth-century America. To do this we must deviate to some extent 

              from the prevailing materialistic framework of modern science. Physical 

              scientists tell us that the mind, with all its conscious experiences, 

              is simply a product of the brain. If we accept this, then all religious 

              experience, whether it be the bliss of Brahman or <i>prema bhakti</i><u>,</u> 

              is simply hallucination. If this is true we can forget about religion 

              unless, of course, we like hallucinations. For an alternative viewpoint, 

              I will turn to the psychologist William James, a nineteenth century 

              scientist who applied the methods of empirical scientific research 

              to the phenomena of religion. Thus his observations are still of 

              relevance today. As a result of his studies, James reached the following 

              conclusions:</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>The further limits of our being plunge, 

              it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of existence 

              from the sensible and merely 'understandable' world. Name it the 

              mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever you choose 

              ... Yet the unseen region in question is not merely ideal, for it 

              produces effects in this world. When we commune with it, work is 

              actually done upon our finite personality, for we are turned into 

              new men, and consequences in the way of conduct follow in the natural 

              world upon our regenerative change. But that which produces effects 

              within another reality must be termed a reality itself, so I feel 

              as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling the unseen or mystical 

              world unreal.<a name="_ednref20"></a><a href="#_edn20" title="">[20]</a></p>

            One could take this idea of a mystical or transcendental dimension 

            and arrive at the following version of Vaisnava philosophy: such a 

            transcendental region does exist and it is the eternal abode of Krsna. 

            Advanced souls can perceive this realm in meditation by the grace 

            of Krsna and so they are able to enter into Krsna's eternal loving 

            pastimes. However, all Puranic descriptions of events within the material 

            world have to be understood rationally on the basis of modern scientific 

            knowledge. On the whole, the mythological stories in the <i>Puranas</i> 

            are not literally true. But the stories pertaining to Krsna's pastimes 

            are not simply fantasy. Rather they are spiritual transmissions into 

            the meditative minds of great souls and they refer not to this world, 

            but to the purely transcendental domain. 

            <p style='text-align:left'>This is a philosophy that might appeal 

              to many persons and I will refer to it as the theology of visions. 

              It allows one to retain the idea of love of God, while at the same 

              time avoiding disturbing conflicts between mythological tales and 

              modern knowledge. It also appears implicitly in the work of some 

              modern scholars of religion who study the <i>bhakti </i>tradition. 

              By way of illustration I will briefly consider an article, <i>Shrines 

              of the</i> <i>Mind</i>, by David Haberman Assistant Professor of 

              Religion at Williams College<a

name="_ednref21"></a><a href="#_edn21" title="">[21]</a>, which argues that Vraja, 

              the traditional place of Krsna's manifest <i>lilas</i><u>,</u> is 

              first and foremost a mental shrine, a realm that can be entered 

              and experienced in meditation. According to Haberman, the physical 

              Vraja, a tract of land in the vicinity of the North Indian city 

              of Mathura, has only been a major centre for the worship of Krsna 

              since the sixteenth century when the followers of Caitanya Mahaprabhu 

              and other Vaisnavas 'rediscovered' the lost sites of Krsna's pastimes. 

              Haberman states that these sites never really existed before the 

              sixteenth century and weren't 'rediscovered' but 'projected' onto 

              the physical landscape of Vraja from the transcendental landscape 

              perceived in meditation. </p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>Haberman gives a number of interpretations 

              of what happens when a person meditates on a mental shrine. These 

              range from the contemplation of imaginary scenes in the ordinary 

              sense to entry into 'an eternal transcendent world which is perceptible 

              only to the mind's eye and is reached through meditative technique.'<a name="_ednref22"></a><a href="#_edn22" title="">[22]</a> 

              Since Haberman seems to lean somewhat towards the latter, it could 

              be said that he is hinting at a version of the theology of visions: 

              one can enter into Krsna's transcendental world by meditation, but 

              Krsna never had any actual pastimes in the physical world. Physical, 

              worldly history followed the lines revealed by modern scholarship. 

              This means that many centuries ago in Vraja there may have been 

              various primitive tribes following animistic cults, but there was 

              no Krsna literally lifting Govardhana Hill. </p>

            Although it allows one to avoid certain conflicts between religion 

            and modern scholarship, this theory has a number of drawbacks:1. It 

            is contrary to Vaisnava tradition, and thus it challenges the thinking 

            of the many great souls who have fully supported the tradition. Since 

            these great souls are the very meditators who have seen transcendental 

            visions of Krsna, the reality of such visions is called into question. 

            In other words, why should persons who see the Absolute realm believe 

            in the truth of myths which even worldly scholars deem to be false? 

            2. It doesn't explain why the worship of Krsna should be a recent 

            affair, as scholars claim. If there is an eternal realm of Krsna that 

            can be accessed by meditation, why did people begin to access it only 

            recently? 

            <p class=MsoBodyText>3. What does it say about the multiplicity of 

              religions? Are the visions reported in other religious traditions 

              real? If not, then why is it that Vaisnava visions alone are real? 

              If so, are there many transcendental realms, one for each religion? 

              Or is it that people see in one transcendental realm whatever they 

              are looking for?</p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>4. It greatly limits the power of God. If God 

              only appears in visions, what becomes of His role as the creator 

              and controller of the universe, which is reduced to practically 

              nothing if we let modern science explain the material world.</p>

            5. The theology of visions can easily be transformed into a purely 

            psychological theory of religious experience. After all, this is the 

            view that will be overwhelmingly favoured by psychologists, neuroscientists 

            and physical scientists. 

            <p style='text-align:left'>In view of the statements contained in 

              the first four points, the conclusion drawn in the final one is 

              almost unavoidable: we are left with a totally mundane theory that 

              explains away religion. In the case of Krsna's <i>lilas,</i> this 

              line of thinking leads us to particularly unpleasant conclusions. 

              Thus Haberman characterises meditation on <i>Krsna lila</i> as follows: 

              'The desired end is a religious voyeurism and vicarious enjoyment 

              said to produce infinite bliss.'<a

name="_ednref23"></a><a href="#_edn23" title="">[23]</a> Such sad conclusions 

              are avoided in the more balanced approach taken by traditional Vaisavas, 

              who stress Krsna's roles as the Supreme Creator and the performer 

              of humanly impossible pastimes on earth.</p>

            <p> <b>Shifting the boundary between myth and science</b></p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>Yet if we start from the theology of visions 

              and proceed in the inductive manner of scholars, we can see how 

              it could serve as a stepping stone for the development of a more 

              satisfactory theory. The starting point for this development is 

              a story that Haberman related about the Vaisnava saint Narottama 

              dasa Thakura. <a

name="_ednref24"></a><a href="#_edn24" title="">[24]</a> It seems that Narottama 

              was once meditating on boiling milk for Radha and Krsna. When the 

              milk boiled over in his meditation, he took the vessel off the fire 

              with his bare hands and was burned in the process. When Narottama 

              awoke from his meditation, he discovered that his hands were actually 

              burnt.</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>There are many stories like this, and I 

              will briefly relate two others. In the second story, Srinivasa Acarya, 

              a contemporary of Narottama dasa Thakura, was meditating on fanning 

              Lord Caitanya. In his meditation, Lord Caitanya placed His garland 

              around Srinivasa's neck. When he awoke from meditation, the unusually 

              fragrant garland was actually around his neck.<a name="_ednref25"></a><a

href="#_edn25" title="">[25]</a><sup> </sup>In the third story a Vaisnava saint 

              named Duhkhi Krsna Dasa was sweeping the site of Krsna's <i>rasa 

              </i>dance in Vraja. He found a remarkable golden anklet and hid 

              it, thinking it very important. An old lady subsequently came to 

              him and asked for the anklet. It turned out that the old lady was 

              really Lalita, one of the transcendental maidservants of Radha and 

              Krsna. The lady finally revealed that the anklet belonged to Radha 

              Herself, and then she manifested her true form as Lalita.<a name="_ednref26"></a><a href="#_edn26"

title="">[26]</a></p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>What are we to make of such stories? The 

              story of the burnt hands might be accepted by many scholars. After 

              all, it is well known that Catholics meditating on the crucifixion 

              of Christ sometimes develop stigmata, in which the wounds of Christ 

              appear on their hands and feet. If meditation can somehow cause 

              bleeding wounds, then perhaps it can also cause burns. The story 

              of the miraculous garland goes one step further: here a tangible 

              object is said to materialise. This may seem fantastic, but it turns 

              out that there is an extensive literature on materialisation. For 

              example Stephen Braude, Professor of Philosophy at the University 

              of Maryland, has argued that many cases of alleged materialisations 

              produced by spirit mediums are backed up by solid empirical evidence 

              which deserves serious study.<a name="_ednref27"></a><a href="#_edn27" title="">[27]</a> 

              If materialisations by spiritualists could be factual, why not materialistions 

              by saintly persons?</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>This brings us to the third story. Although 

              this story seems 'far out', there are many similar stories in which 

              a transcendental personality appears to step into our material continuum, 

              perform some action and then disappear. Another example would be 

              the story from <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> in which Krsna, as a small 

              boy, approached the saint Madhavendra Puri, gave him a pot of milk 

              and then mysteriously disappeared. Madhavendra Puri drank the milk, 

              thus showing that it was tangible. Later that night he had a dream 

              in which Krsna revealed the location of the Gopala Deity which had 

              been originally installed by Krsna's grandson Vajra and had been 

              hidden during a Mohammedan attack. <a

name="_ednref28"></a><a href="#_edn28" title="">[28]</a></p>

            The stories of the burnt hand, the miraculous garland and the transcendental 

            visits are progressively harder to accept from a conventional scientific 

            standpoint. But it is hard to see how to draw a line between stories 

            of this kind that might possibly be true and ones that definitely 

            cannot be. In addition, all the stories seem to hint at energetic 

            exchanges between spiritual and material energy that might add an 

            important new chapter to our scientific knowledge, if only they could 

            be properly studied. 

            <p class=MsoBodyText>In studying a body of empirical evidence, we 

              always evaluate that evidence on the basis of our limiting assumptions. 

              In the end, the conclusions we derive from the evidence may reflect 

              our limiting assumptions as much as they reflect the evidence itself. 

              If the limiting assumptions change, then the conclusions will also 

              change, even though the body of evidence remains the same. </p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>Consider what might happen if all the available 

              evidence regarding the history of human experience were to be studied, 

              not on the basis of nineteenth-century rationalism but of a new 

              science in which spiritual transformations of matter were considered 

              to be a real possibility. The result might be a completely different 

              picture of the past than the one now accepted by scholars. For one 

              thing, the objections that William Jones expressed about the story 

              of the Pandava brothers might not seem so weighty as they do from 

              a conventional scholarly viewpoint. If higher beings can step into 

              our continuum from another realm, then humans might well be descended 

              from such beings. This new picture of the past might prove to be 

              much more compatible with traditional spiritual teachings than the 

              one that now prevails.</p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>However, there are some indications that a broader 

              approach to science may be developing. In the days of Vivekananda 

              and Bhaktivinode Thakura, it appeared that mechanistic, reductionistic 

              science was marching unimpeded from triumph to triumph, and many 

              people believed it would soon find explanations for everything. 

              But here in the late twentieth century, this triumphant march has 

              been checked on many different fronts by apparently insuperable 

              obstacles.</p>

            <p style='text-align:left'>For example, physics looked like a closed 

              subject in the 1890s, but in the early decades of the twentieth 

              century it entered a phase of paradox and mystery with the development 

              of relativity theory and quantum mechanics. The mysteries of quantum 

              mechanics continue to inspire scientists to contemplate ideas that 

              would have seemed outrageously mystical at the turn of the century.<a

name="_ednref31"></a><a href="#_edn31" title="">[31]</a> Physics has now encountered 

              an even more serious obstacle: the bold architects of universal 

              physical theories are beginning to realise that these theories can 

              never be adequately tested by experiment.<a name="_ednref32"></a><a

href="#_edn32" title="">[32]</a><sup> </sup>Thus the Harvard physicist Howard 

              Georgi characterised modern theoretical physics as 'recreational 

              mathematical theology'. <a name="_ednref33"></a><a

href="#_edn33" title="">[33]</a></p>

            In the mid-twentieth century, computer scientists believed they were 

            on the verge of proving that thought is mechanical, thereby fulfilling 

            La Mettrie's eighteenth century dream of man as machine. However, 

            in more recent years, even though computers have become more and more 

            powerful, the dream of simulating human intelligence seems to recede 

            further and further into the future. 

            <p style='text-align:left'>With the discovery of the DNA spiral helix 

              by Watson and Crick in 1953, many scientists thought that the ultimate 

              secret of life had been revealed. Since then, molecular biologists 

              have had tremendous success in elucidating the molecular mechanisms 

              of living cells. But as molecular biology unveils the incredible 

              complexity of these high-precision mechanisms, the goal of explaining 

              the origin of life seems progressively more difficult to attain.<a name="_ednref34"></a><a

href="#_edn34" title="">[34]</a> </p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>These are just a few of the many areas in which 

              the programme of mechanistic reductionism seems to be reaching ultimate 

              limits as the twentieth century draws to a close. Perhaps as a result 

              of these developments, many scientists are now showing a willingness 

              to consider theoretical ideas and areas of research that have been 

              traditionally taboo in the scientific community. For example, we 

              now find organisations of professional scientists openly studying 

              phenomena lying on the interface between physical science and the 

              realms of mysticism and the paranormal. Examples are the International 

              Association for New Science (IANS), the Society for Scientific Exploration 

              (SSE), the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) and the International 

              Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine (ISSSEEM). 

              These organisations all sponsor regular scientific conferences. 

              Some of the phenomena studied by these groups seem very similar 

              to 'mythical' phenomena so often reported in old religious texts 

              and in recent accounts of religious experiences. A synergistic interaction 

              between scholars of religion and these new scientific organisations 

              might prove to be a valuable source of new insights for both groups 

              of researchers.</p>

            <p> <b>The direct presentation of Vaisnava teachings</b></p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>We have discussed how Bhaktivinode Thakura found 

              it necessary to present a modified version of the Vaisnava teachings 

              to young Bengali intellectuals at the height of British political 

              and ideological imperialism. However, as the sun began to set on 

              the British empire his son and successor, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 

              Sarasvati, began a vigorous programme of directly presenting the 

              Vaisnava conclusions throughout India. This programme was taken 

              abroad by his disciple, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, 

              who boldly celebrated the ancient Ratha Yatra festival of Jagannatha 

              Puri in London's Trafalgar Square.</p>

            With the changing climate of scientific opinion, the time may have 

            come to openly introduce the traditional teachings of <i>bhakti</i> 

            to the world's intellectual communities. The once jarring conflicts 

            between rationalism and traditional religion may be progressively 

            reduced as science matures and becomes open to the study of mystical 

            phenomena. There may even exist the possibility of establishing an 

            approach to religion that is intellectually acceptable and at the 

            same time satisfies the soul's inner desire for love in a transcendental 

            relationship.This leaves us with one possible objection. Could it 

            be that the Vaisnava teachings, with their specific emphasis on Krsna 

            as the Supreme, are guilty of sectarian disregard for other religious 

            traditions? The answer is that, of course, any doctrine can be presented 

            in a narrow, sectarian way. However, as Bhaktivinode Thakura pointed 

            out in his essay on the <i>Bhagavat</i><u>,</u> the Vaisnava teachings 

            are inherently broad-minded and acknowledge the value of all religious 

            systems, as illustrated in the following prayer from the <i>Bhagavat</i>: 

            <p style='text-align:left'>O my Lord, Your devotees can see You through 

              the ears by the process of bona fide hearing, and thus their hearts 

              become cleansed, and You take Your seat there. You are so merciful 

              to Your devotees that You manifest Yourself in the particular eternal 

              form of transcendence in which they always think of You.<a

name="_ednref35"></a><a href="#_edn35" title="">[35]</a></p>

            God appears to His devoted worshippers in many different forms, depending 

            on their particular desires. These forms include the different <i>avataras</i> 

            of Krsna described in traditional Vaisnava texts, but they are not 

            limited to these. Indeed, it is said that the different expansions 

            of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are uncountable and they cannot 

            be fully described in the finite scriptures of any one religious community.The 

            following verse gives some idea of the different religious communities 

            in the universe, as described by the <i>Bhagavat</i>: 

            <p style='text-align:left'>From the forefathers headed by Bhrgu Muni 

              and other sons of Brahma appeared many children and descendants, 

              who assumed different forms as demigods, demons, human beings, Guhyakas, 

              Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Caranas, Kindevas, Kinnaras, Nagas, 

              Kimpuru\sas, and so on. All of the many universal species, along 

              with their respective leaders, appeared with different natures and 

              desires generated from the three modes of material nature. Therefore, 

              because of the different characteristics of the living entities 

              within the universe, there are a great many Vedic rituals, mantras, 

              and rewards.</p>

            <p class=MsoBodyText>This statement is explicitly 'mythological', 

              and one can well imagine how Sir William Jones might have reacted 

              to it. However, it presents a grand picture of innumerable races 

              and societies within the universe, all of whom are given different 

              religious dispensations suitable for their particular situations 

              and natures. Here the word 'Vedic' cannot be limited to particular 

              Sanskrit texts that may be existing in India at the present time. 

              Rather, it refers to the sum total of religious systems revealed 

              by the infinite Supreme God for the sake of elevating innumerable 

              societies of divinely created beings. </p>

            As always, the distinguishing feature of the Vaisnava teachings is 

            that God is a real person and His variegated creation is also real. 

            Thus the Vaisnava approach to religious liberality is to regard all 

            genuine religions as real divine revelations. Likewise, the Vaisnava 

            teachings of love of God aim to establish a relationship of loving 

            service between the real individual soul and the Supreme Personality 

            of Godhead, the performer of real transcendental pastimes.
