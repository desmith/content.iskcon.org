            <b>His Divine Grace and the Revised Bhagavad-Gita<br>
            </b>by Joseph Vekerdi 
            <p>The book market in Hungary has been inundated with Eastern kitschover 
              the last few years. Although it is just as difficult to findpublishers 
              for the bona fide Hungarian translations of the Easternliterary 
              works and the classical values of our national assets,there are 
              dozens of reprints of the false Eastern imitations andthe second- 
              and third-hand Eastern religious philosophical flightsof wit as 
              well as the Western (or said to be Western) thrillerson the shelves 
              of the bookstalls in the streets. The religious publicationsthat 
              are proclaimed to be Indian stand in the first place.</p>
            The Hungarian imitation of the <i>Bhagavad-Gita </i>(The Proclamationof 
            the Almighty), the most important work in Indian religious philosophy,is 
            outstanding among these. Its full title is 'The Full Edition ofthe 
            Original Bhagavad Gita<i>,</i> with the original Sanskrit texts,Roman 
            transliterations, Hungarian equivalents, translation and elaboratepurports, 
            by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,the founder-<i>acarya</i> 
            of the International Society for KrishnaConsciousness, The Bhaktivedanta 
            Book Trust, Vaduz. The original titleof the book is <i>Bhagavad-Gita 
            As It Is. </i>Translation by Dvarakesadasa Brahmacari. Copy editor: 
            M.K.' 
            <p>One would be happy to receive an 'original' work after somany unreliable 
              interpretations. Doubts only arise after reading thetranslations 
              of 'His Divine Grace', especially if one has alreadyread passages 
              of the <i>Gita</i> from the authorised <i>Mahabharata</i>translation 
              by Szerdahelyi Istvan. The contents and style are verydifferent. 
              It should be noted that in the so-called original, itsdreadful Hungarian 
              translation was not made from the original Sanskrit,but from the 
              English revision of 'His Divine Grace'. The high soundingSanskrit 
              name of the translator ('Krsna's slave novice') belongs toa Hungarian 
              national. If one also reads the true translation (TheProclamation 
              of the Almighty, <i>Bhagavad-Gita, </i>Bp 1987) of thefull text 
              and philological commentary by Lakatos Istvan - which verifiesSzerdahelyi 
              - one will have no more doubts about 'originality'. Itis in vain 
              that His Divine Grace shows pride in being thirty-secondin the line 
              through which Krsna gave this superhuman wisdom, firstto the creator, 
              Brahma, later to the poet, Vyasa - who lived for thousandsof years 
              - and finally to himself. 
            <p>Let us examine this original Sanskrit text. Even by readingthe 
              first two words we can see the differences that are present throughoutthe 
              whole revision. The <i>Gita</i> is an episode from the <i>Mahabharata</i>where 
              prior to the battle of Kureksetra, Krsna, the Supreme Godhead,the 
              Universal Soul, speaks his philosophy.  The Sanskrit text is <i>dharmaksetre</i><i>kuruksetre</i>: 
              'on the land of Truth, Kuruksetra'. Szerdahelyi'stranslation reads: 
              'on the land of the Kurus'; Lakatos': 'the landof the Kurus, the 
              holy place', and His Divine Grace's: 'the placeof pilgrimage at 
              Kuruksetra'. In addition, the most popular IndianEnglish translation 
              by Jayandalal Goyandaka interprets <i>dharmaksetre</i><i>kuruksetre 
              </i>as: 'on the sacred soil of Kuruksetra'. Why are thereso many 
              different interpretations? 
            <p>The poetical imagination placed the pseudo-historical battleon 
              the Kuru field northeast of India's legendary cultural centre -modern 
              Delhi. The name of the place has become a symbol, just likethe Verecke-pass 
              or Pusztaszer in Hungary. There has never been apilgrimage site 
              at Kuruksetra (since its precise location was unknown).His Divine 
              Grace explains in his Purport: 'Kuruksetra is a place ofworship 
              even for the demigods of the higher planets'. He fails toexplain 
              that the meaning of the word <i>dharma</i> is not 'pilgrimage'but 
              'law, truth'. This can be compared to translating the 'holy peakof 
              the Carpathians' in the Hungary national anthem as 'the pilgrimagesite 
              of the Carpathians'. 
            <p>I will cite another example from Chapter 4, verse 28, whereKrsna 
              speaks about the importance of renunciation and sacrifice: 'Somesacrifice 
              their possessions, others sacrifice by austerities or bypractising 
              yoga'. (<i>dravya-yajnas</i><i> tapo-yajnas yoga-yajnastathapare</i>). 
              His Divine Grace interprets this as: 'There are otherswho have become 
              enlightened by having sacrificed their material possessionsinto 
              strict austerities. They take strict vows and practise the yogaof 
              eight-fold mysticism'. I should point out that this is not thepurport, 
              just the translation! 
            <p>This distortion is present throughout the whole text. His DivineGrace 
              changes the word 'knowledge' (<i>jnana</i>) to 'transcendentalknowledge'; 
              the epistemological technical term for 'knowledge andcognition' 
              (<i>jnana-vijnana</i>) to 'absolute truth' and the importantpantheistic 
              concept 'universe' (<i>sarvam</i><i> idam</i>) to 'thewhole body', 
              not to speak of the sentimental, kitsch effusions addedas purports. 
              Meanwhile he constantly repeats that redemption canbe attained only 
              by those who join his Krishna consciousness movement. 
            <p>Here we see the real reason behind this translation. The HareKrishna 
              movement was not born in India, but in America, and is financedfrom 
              there. Its European expansion also serves the cultural expansionof 
              America. The place of publication, Vaduz, is the main seat oftheir 
              shady international holding business. The movement's organisationis 
              so far from Indian religiousness - which is based on individualdevotion 
              - that there isn't even a Hindu church.</p>
            <p>This propaganda of American spirit is to the liking of those whopropose 
              drugs for the young and organise homosexual clubs insteadof nursery 
              schools in the name of 'difference'. This pseudo-Indianmysticism 
              is truly 'different' from the traditional European Jewish-Christianculture 
              and the traditional Indian Hindu religiousness: it is destructive.</p>

            <p>Charles S. J. White, Ph.D, Professor Emeritus, Department of Philosophy&amp; 
              Religion, The American University, USA</p>
            Joseph Vekerdi's attack on A. C. Bhaktivedanta's translation of the<i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> 
            and on the Hare Krishna movement demands a response.By way of explanation 
            of my concern, one might note that I have specialisedthroughout my 
            academic career in the scholarly interpretation of Hinduismspecifically, 
            and the history of religions generally. In both areasI have published 
            translations, monographs, journal articles, encyclopaediaarticles 
            etc.. I have also investigated and published in the areaof new Hindu 
            religious movements. I became acquainted with the InternationalSociety 
            for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) soon after it began itsmission 
            in the United States under the guidance of A. C. Bhaktivedanta. 
            <p>Let me say first of all, and most emphatically, that the HareKrishna 
              movement has deep and unimpeachable sources in traditionalHindu 
              experience and history. It is a development from the Gaudiya<i>sampradaya</i><i>,</i> 
              a medieval Hindu movement that began inVrindavan (a religious centre 
              associated with Krsna's life as an <i>avatar</i>of Vishnu and an 
              active place of pilgrimage today) under the inspirationof close 
              followers of Sri Caitanya, a great Bengali Vaishnava saint,who is 
              a principal source of devotion for the adherents of ISKCON.Contrary 
              to Vekerdi's claim, there are many organised Hindu sub-groups,analogous 
              to churches in the Christian world. These groups, some ofwhich are 
              called by the generic term <i>sampradaya</i><i>,</i> tracetheir 
              origins to specific Hindu, historical personalities who exhibitedunusual 
              spiritual qualities, both devotional and intellectual, andwho established 
              lineages of disciplic succession to perpetuate theirspiritual experiences 
              and intellectual viewpoints. The Hare Krishnasare in the disciplic 
              succession of the Gaudiya <i>sampradaya</i> andare nowadays recognised 
              everywhere in Hindu India as a legitimateextension of the authentic 
              <i>parampara</i><i>,</i> or disciplic succession,of the Gaudiya 
              <i>sampradaya</i><i>.</i> 
            <p> Although I am not a member of ISKCON, I have engaged in academiccollaboration 
              and travelled widely in India with its members. It maystill be a 
              matter of minor comment in some circles that Westernersshould have 
              adopted the Hindu way of life to the extent that the membersof ISKCON 
              have. Nevertheless, in my travels with them I was impressedto see 
              the genuine acceptance of Western ISKCON members by other IndianHindus. 
              Indeed, ISKCON's Western adherents are now so well acceptedin India 
              that their presence is actually a matter of pride to otherHindus 
              who see the Hare Krishnas as a further confirmation of theirown 
              religious traditions. 
            <p>I would agree that A. C. Bhaktivedanta's translations of Hindutexts 
              reflect his sectarian tradition but this is true of other translationsof 
              the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> and other works. However, I know frompersonal 
              knowledge that some Sanskrit teachers in US Universitieshave used 
              A. C. Bhaktivedanta's translation of the <i>Gita</i> asa text in 
              their second year Sanskrit courses. Teachers of comparativereligion 
              have also used it in other types of courses. 
            <p>Further, Vekerdi's quibbling insistence, for example, on atwo-word 
              translation of <i>dharma</i> as 'law, truth' is simply wrong.<i>Dharma</i> 
              has a multitude of meanings in Indian philosophicaland religious 
              writing besides those given by Vekerdi. If one doesnot care for 
              Bhaktivedanta's translation, there are others available;but this 
              is not to say that Bhaktivedanta's <i>Bhagavad-Gita </i>isnot a 
              valid translation in the context of the Vaishnava understandingof 
              the text. 
            <p> I would urge Joseph Vekerdi to take the trouble of becoming more 
              familiar with the total picture of ISKCON in its Indian and internationalaspects. 
              He would find, as I have, an impressive sincerity and opennessin 
              the ISKCON leadership. It is sad to read Vekerdi sum up a spiritualteaching 
              that produces whole adult lifetimes of self-sacrificing religiouscommitment 
              and practice - I refer specifically to the lives of ISKCONdevotees 
              whom I have known for many years - as kitsch. The use ofsuch an 
              epithet is sheer bigotry.

            <p><strong>A Response to:<br>
              </strong><strong>'His Divine Grace and the Revised Bhagavad-Gita'</strong></p>
            by Joseph Vekerdi 
            <p>Thomas J. Hopkins, Ph.D, Professor, Department of Religious Studies,Franklin 
              and Marshall College, USA 
            <p>I have read the English translation of Joseph Vekerdi's essay in 
              <i>Lifeand Literature</i> entitled<i> </i>'His Divine Grace and 
              the Revised<i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>'. I must say that I find it disappointing 
              asa scholarly statement on Prabhupada's translation, the <i>Gita</i>itself 
              and the Hindu tradition as a whole. I have no doubt that Vekerdiis 
              a competent Indologist in some area of study, but he is clearlyoutside 
              his field of competence in this essay. 
            <p>Vekerdi's critique of Prabhupada's translation can be dividedinto 
              two categories: his criticism of how certain verses are translatedand 
              his denial that Prabhupada represents 'traditional Indian Hindureligiousness'. 
              Although Vekerdi's most serious error is in thelatter category, 
              I will begin with his critique of specific translations.He fortunately 
              gives only a few examples, because each representsa complex pattern 
              of misunderstanding. 
            <p><strong>Dharmaksetre kuruksetre </strong> 
            <p>Vekerdi devotes two full paragraphsto his critique of Prabhupada's 
              translation of the first two Sanskrit words in the <i>Gita</i><i>: 
              dharmaksetre kuruksetre, </i>which Prabhupadatranslates as 'in the 
              place of pilgrimage at Kuruksetra'. There isno issue with the translation 
              of <i>kuruksetra</i><i>,</i> literally'the field of the Kurus', 
              but Vekerdi strongly criticises the translationof <i>dharmaksetra</i> 
              as 'the place of pilgrimage'. As Vekerdi says,it is true that 'the 
              meaning of the term "<i>dharma</i>" is not "pilgrimage"',but that 
              is not the point. Prabhupada certainly knows that, as doeseveryone 
              who has ever studied Sanskrit and quite a few who haven't.A literal 
              translation of <i>dharmaksetra</i> would thus be 'the fieldof <i>dharma</i>', 
              or 'the place of law / truth / duty / justice/virtue / morality' 
              (to use only a few of the possible translationsof the multi-faceted 
              term <i>dharma</i>). 
            <p> Prabhupada could obviously have translated <i>dharmaksetra</i>literally, 
              as most translators do; the preferred English translationby most 
              Hindu translators is 'the sacred soil' (cited by Vekerdi)or 'the 
              holy plain' (as in Swami Vireswarananda's translation of <i>Srimad</i><i>Bhagavad-Gita 
              </i>with Sridhara Swami's commentary), although Radhakrishnantranslates 
              it more literally as 'the field of righteousness'. Prabhupada'spoint 
              is more subtle, however, and seems to have been totally missedby 
              Vekerdi. 
            <p>Prabhupada explains in his Purport to the <i>Gita</i> 1.1that <i>dharma-ksetra 
              </i>has the meaning of 'a place where religiousrituals are performed', 
              and that this is significant because Dhrtarastra- to whom the battle 
              scene is being described by Sanjaya - knows thisand fears the outcome 
              of the impending battle in such a holy placethat would 'influence 
              Arjuna and the sons of Pandu favourably, becauseby nature they were 
              all virtuous'. What Prabhupada does not revealin his Purport, and 
              no doubt believed that he need not say to anyonewho was familiar 
              with the <i>Mahabharata</i> or Hindu culture, isthat Kuruksetra 
              had already been praised by the sage Pulastya earlierin the <i>Mahabharata</i> 
              (Critical Edition, 3.81) as a 'much-lauded'pilgrimage site to which 
              anyone who goes in a spirit of faith 'obtainsthe fruit of a Royal 
              Consecration and Horse Sacrifice' (3.81.6). Kuruksetrahas thus been 
              presented as a sacred pilgrimage site in the <i>Mahabharata</i>narrative 
              in Book Six (6.23-40 in the Critical Edition) long beforethe appearance 
              of the <i>Gita</i>, and its identity as an already-famousplace of 
              pilgrimage is taken for granted by the narrator.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1] 
              </a> 
            <p> Given this background, and the fact that Kuruksetra was asacred 
              site known as <i>dharmaksetra</i> as early as the <i>Vedic</i><i>Brahmanas</i> 
              (Kane, op. cit., p. 680), Prabhupada stands clearlywithin the tradition 
              when he translates <i>dharmaksetra</i> as 'theplace of pilgrimage' 
              to identify the sacred ritual centre Kuruksetraas the scene of the 
              coming battle. What is surprising is that an Indologistsuch as Joseph 
              Vekerdi knows nothing of this tradition, as evidencedby his authoritatively 
              stated claim that 'there has never been a pilgrimagesite at Kuruksetra'. 
              The <i>Mahabharata</i> and <i>Puranas</i> clearlystate otherwise, 
              Hindus know otherwise, and it is the Indian Hindutradition that 
              Prabhupada assumes in his translation. 
            <p><b><i>Gita</i></b><b> 4.28</b> 
            <p>Vekerdi's second textual criticism, chosen (in his own words) 'atrandom', 
              is the translation of <i>Gita</i> 4.28. Here he quotes onlythe first 
              half of the Sanskrit <i>sloka</i><i>, dravyayajnas tapoyajnayogayajnas 
              tathapare, </i>which he translates as 'Some sacrifice theirpossessions, 
              others sacrifice by austerities or by practising yoga'.He then quotes 
              Prabhupada's translation of the entire verse, whichsays that 'having 
              accepted strict vows, some become enlightened bysacrificing their 
              possessions, and others by performing severe austerities,by practising 
              the yoga of eight-fold mysticism, or by studying the<i>Vedas</i> 
              to advance in transcendental knowledge'. This translation,Vekerdi 
              claims, has been 'made up' by Prabhupada from the 'one line'of Sanskrit 
              that Vekerdi has quoted. It is obvious, however, thatPrabhupada's 
              translation is based on both lines of the Sanskrit <i>sloka</i><i>,</i>not 
              just the one Vekerdi quotes: the phrase 'having accepted strictvows' 
              translates the term <i>samsita-vratah</i><i> </i>in the secondhalf 
              of the <i>sloka</i><i>, </i>while the phrase 'studying the <i>Vedas</i>to 
              advance in transcendental knowledge' translates <i>svadhyaya-jnana-yajnas</i><i>,</i>also 
              in the second half of the <i>sloka</i><i>.</i> 
            <p>If we look at the whole Sanskrit verse, and not just the half-versequoted 
              by Vekerdi, we can see clearly that Prabhupada has not 'madeup' 
              his translation; he has simply translated the full verse as itappears 
              in the <i>Gita</i> and not just the first half that Vekerdiquotes. 
            <p>The only thing that Prabhupada adds to a strictly literaltranslation 
              is the phrase 'of eight-fold mysticism' to qualify theterm yoga 
              in <i>yoga-yajnas </i>and distinguish it from other meaningsof yoga 
              in the <i>Gita</i><i>.</i> As Prabhupada makes clear in hisPurport 
              on this verse, he interprets the term in this way so thatit may 
              be used in reference to 'different kinds of mystic yogas likethe 
              Patanjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute),<i>hatha</i><i>-yoga 
              </i>or <i>astanga</i><i>-yoga </i>(for particularperfections)'. 
              A glance at various commentaries on this verse suchas those of Sridhara 
              Swami, Sankara or others that are found in RobertN. Minor's <i>Bhagavad-Gita: 
              An Exegetical Commentary,</i> indicatesthat the term <i>yoga-yajnas 
              </i>is given different meanings by differentcommentators. Prabhupada 
              is simply clarifying what he takes to bethe meaning with reference 
              to the commentary tradition, not 'makingup' something that is not 
              there. Vekerdi does not seem to understandthat any Hindu translator 
              or commentator works within an establishedtradition of commentaries, 
              and positions himself in relation to whatothers have said. Prabhupada 
              is doing no more than that as he makesclear in his Purport. 
            <p><strong>Jnana </strong> 
            <p>Vekerdi's next criticism is Prabhupada's translationof <i>jnana</i> 
              as 'transcendental knowledge', claiming that it changesthe word 
              'knowledge' (<i>jnana</i>) to something else. However, theEnglish 
              word 'knowledge' has many possible meanings, as I suspectthe Hungarian 
              equivalent does also, while the Sanskrit term <i>jnana</i>has a 
              very specific meaning: knowledge of the unchanging reality ofBrahman 
              or <i>atman.</i> To avoid confusion, Prabhupada thus translates<i>jnana</i> 
              consistently as 'transcendental knowledge' to distinguishit from 
              other more mundane kinds of knowledge. Far from being devious,as 
              Vekerdi implies, this is nothing more than using a translationthat 
              comes closest to the meaning of <i>jnana</i> in its Hindu context. 
            <p><strong> Knowledge and cognition</strong> 
            <p> Vekerdi next claims that Prabhupada'changes ... the epistemological 
              technical term "knowledge and cognition"(<i>jnana-vijnana</i>) to 
              "absolute truth"'. The term <i>jnana-vijnana</i><i></i>appears twice 
              in the <i>Gita</i><i>,</i> in 3.41 and 6.8, bothas  compounds: <i>jnana-vijnana-nasanam</i><i> 
              </i>in 3.41 and <i>jnana-vijnana-trptatma</i><i></i>in 6.8. In both 
              cases, Prabhupada translates <i>jnana</i> as 'knowledge'in this 
              compound form and <i>vijnana</i> as 'self-realisation' (3.41)or 
              'realisation' (6.8). Again, however, Prabhupada is clearly respondingto 
              an issue posed by earlier commentaries. As Robert Minor says, 'thevariety 
              of interpretations of commentators on the distinction between<i>jnana</i> 
              and <i>vijnana</i> is great', and he then illustratesthis by citing 
              the various interpretations of commentators from theclassical views 
              of Sankara and Ramanuja to a host of modern scholars.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"title="">[2] 
              </a> 
            <p>As one might expect, Prabhupada's translations of the termscome 
              closest to the meanings given by the Vaisnava devotional scholarRamanuja, 
              who refers to <i>jnana</i> as 'knowledge of the nature ofthe self' 
              and <i>vijnana</i> as 'a deeper discrimination of the self(<i>atma-viveka</i>)'. 
              In a situation where there is no certain meaningof the terms established 
              by a consensus of commentaries, Prabhupadais giving his own best 
              interpretation based on the commentator whoseauthority he most trusts; 
              the explanation of his translation is givenopenly in his Purports 
              to the two verses so there is no confusionabout what he means. 
            <p>Vekerdi again seems to know nothing about the commentary traditionon 
              the issues involved, but instead considers <i>jnana-vijnana</i><i></i>to 
              be a 'technical term in epistemology' meaning 'knowledge andcognition'. 
              This assumption that there is a single meaning of theterms either 
              together or separately, ignores the long debate overthe meaning 
              of both terms in Hindu as well as Buddhist philosophy,and it places 
              their assumed meaning entirely outside the context ofthe <i>Gita</i> 
              in the field of epistemology. If anything is certain,it is that 
              the <i>Gita</i> does not use the term <i>jnana-vijnana</i><i></i>as 
              a 'technical term in epistemology' since it predates the riseof 
              philosophical schools with a precise technical terminology forconcepts 
              in epistemology or any other area of philosophical discourse. 
            <p><strong>Sarvam idam</strong> 
            <p> Much the same problem appears in Vekerdi's assumptionthat <i>sarvam</i><i> 
              idam </i>in 2.17 represents the 'important pantheisticconcept "universe"', 
              which he claims Prabhupada changes to 'the wholebody' in his translation. 
              This verse is part of Krsna's teaching aboutthe difference between 
              the <i>dehin</i> (the indestructible 'embodiedone', later identified 
              with the <i>atman</i> or 'self') and the perishable<i>deha</i> or 
              'body' in which it appears in the world. Verse 2.17explains that 
              'that' (<i>tat</i>) by which 'all 'this' (<i>sarvam</i><i>idam</i>) 
              is pervaded should be known as 'imperishable' (<i>avinasi</i>).Commentators 
              in all ages have struggled with the meanings of and /or references 
              to the terms <i>tat</i> and <i>sarvam</i><i> idam,</i>as Minor's 
              survey of commentaries makes clear (op. cit., pp. 41-3).The all-pervading 
              <i>tat</i> clearly refers to the imperishable andindestructible 
              <i>dehin</i><i>,</i> but commentators disagree aboutwhether <i>tat</i> 
              refers to the neuter Brahman (Sankara's position)or to the 'category 
              of individual selves' (Ramanuja's position). Similarly,some take 
              <i>sarvam</i><i> idam </i>to mean "this universe", whileothers such 
              as Sridhara Swami and Prabhupada take it to mean the bodyor bodies 
              which the <i>atman</i> or 'self' (the embodied <i>dehin</i>)pervades. 
            <p>The issue here is not whose view of this verse is right orwrong; 
              if that could be known with certainty, there would not havebeen 
              a thousand years of debate between commentators. Rather, it isthat 
              Prabhupada stands in a long tradition of interpretation thatshapes 
              his translation of <i>sarvam</i><i> idam </i>as 'the entirebody' 
              in contrast to Sankara's (and Vekerdi's) monistic or 'pantheistic'interpretation 
              of the term. This is not a 'distortion' of the meaning,as Vekerdi 
              claims, but instead a choice of one traditional interpretationover 
              another. This choice, moreover, is entirely consistent with theless 
              ambiguous meaning of the following verse, which says that 'thesebodies' 
              (<i>ime</i><i> deha</i>) of the 'embodied' (<i>saririnah</i>)are 
              said to 'come to an end' (<i>antavanta</i>). Whatever one saysabout 
              Prabhupada's translation, he clearly does not stand alone inhis 
              reading of its meaning, which is not inconsistent with the <i>Gita's</i>self-evident 
              meaning in other verses. 
            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> 
            <p> This is the sum total of Vekerdi's textual critiqueof Prabhupada's 
              translation. He claims that these are 'random' examples;if so, he 
              is remarkably unlucky in his choices. Not a single criticismthat 
              he makes stands up to scrutiny and he reveals in the processa lack 
              of knowledge of Hindu religion, the <i>Gita</i> and the commentarialtradition 
              that one would not expect from a trained Indologist. 
            <p>However, if this speaks for Vekerdi's textual criticisms, it doeseven 
              more so for his final paragraph. He claims, for example, thatthe 
              organisation of the Hare Krishna movement is alien to 'Indianreligiousness', 
              a statement that reveals a total ignorance of allthe devotional 
              movements in India from Sri Vaisnavism and SaivaSiddhanta to Caitanya's 
              Gaudiya Vaishnavism and the modern KrishnaConsciousness movement 
              started by Bhaktivinoda Thakura in Bengalin the nineteenth century. 
              Contrary to what Vekerdi says, it issimply an historical fact that 
              the 'Hare Krishna' movement, as hecalls it, started in India as 
              a purely Indian outgrowth of the earlierCaitanya movement in Bengal. 
              Prabhupada represented the third generationof that movement in India 
              as the disciple of Bhaktivinoda Thakura'sson Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, 
              and he did not come to America untilhe was seventy years old after 
              a lifetime of devotional serviceand translation work in India. 
            <p>It is true that many of Prabhupada's own early disciples wereAmerican, 
              but quite a few of these have become accomplished Sanskritistsor 
              Bengali specialists to a degree that has won them acceptanceas equals 
              by Brahmans in India, not only for their scholarship butfor their 
              purity of devotion and practice. One can hardly imaginehow, as Vekerdi 
              claims, this 'serves the cultural expansion of America'in Europe 
              or anywhere else. Moreover, Prabhupada himself was adamantlyopposed 
              to drugs and sexual promiscuity, and he enforced this oppositionwithin 
              his movement. Whatever Vekerdi may think of 'American spirit'in 
              general (which he seems to believe is some monolithic culturalposition), 
              he can certainly not claim that the Krishna Consciousnessmovement 
              presents a 'spirit' that is 'to the liking of those whopropose drugs 
              for the young and organise homosexual clubs insteadof nursery schools 
              in the name of "difference"'. The 'difference'the Krishna Consciousness 
              Movement represents is another thing thatVekerdi seemingly does 
              not understand: 'traditional Indian Hindureligiousness' that is 
              not 'destructive' as he claims but rathera means of purifying the 
              body and mind for service to the Lord.</p>
