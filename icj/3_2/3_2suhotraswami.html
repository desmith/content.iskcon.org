            Swami </strong></a> 
            <p><em>In this article, Suhotra Swami discusses various approaches 
              to acquiring knowledge.  He examines this phenomena in terms of 
              the three pramanas (pratyaksa, anumana and sabda), which are the 
              recognised sources of knowledge in the Vaisnava tradition. Suhotra 
              Swami explains that in Vaisnava epistemology sabda (hearing from 
              an authoritative source) is accorded the greatest regard.  He examines 
              the methods of direct perception and logical argument and offers 
              an interesting analysis of their limitations in comparison to sabda 
              as a source of infallible and transcendental knowledge.</em></p>
            'How can I be certain that what you are telling me is true?' Every 
            thinking person asks, and is asked, this question. Vedic philosophy 
            arrives at certitude through <i>pramana</i><i>, </i>which refers to 
            sources of knowledge that are held to be valid. In the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya 
            Sampradaya, the school of Vedic knowledge that ISKCON represents, 
            there are three <i>pramanas</i><i>:</i> <i>pratyaksa</i> (direct perception), 
            <i>anumana</i> (logical argument) and <i>sabda</i> (authoritative 
            testimony). Of these, <i>sabda</i> is imperative, while <i>pratyaksa</i> 
            and <i>anumana</i> are supportive. Therefore, when a devotee of Krsna 
            is asked about the certainty of his beliefs he usually answers by 
            quoting authority: <i>guru</i> (the spiritual master), <i>sastra</i> 
            (the Vedic scriptures) and <i>sadhu</i> (other devotees respected 
            for their realisation of the teachings of <i>guru</i> and <i>sastra</i>). 
            <p>In Western schools of thought, citing authority to certify what 
              we say doesn't seem to count for much any more. There is a Latin 
              phrase for this kind of proof, <i>ipse dixit</i> ('he himself has 
              said it'), which is the answer that disciples of an ancient Greek 
              sage used to give whenever an opponent called the sage's doctrine 
              into question. The problem modern thinkers have with <i>ipse dixit</i> 
              is that its evidence lies only in words. And words alone don't prove 
              anything. 
            <p>Lucy in the land of Narnia C. S. Lewis, in <i>The Chronicles of 
              Narnia,</i> illustrates the modern difficulty with <i>ipse dixit</i> 
              proof. In the story, an odd thing happens to Lucy, the youngest 
              of four children visiting the large, eccentric home of an elderly 
              professor: she passes through the back of a clothes closet into 
              another land called Narnia. When Lucy returns and relates her experience 
              to her brothers and sister, they conclude that her senses had to 
              have been mysteriously deluded. The children finally bring the matter 
              before an authority, the professor himself. His decision is that 
              because Lucy is not known to be a liar, nor mad, she must be telling 
              the truth. Lucy's brother Peter still cannot believe it. He argues 
              that the other children found no strange land through the back of 
              the closet. 
            <p>'What's that got to do with it?' the professor asks.'Well, Sir, 
              if things are real, they are there all the time.' </p>
            <p>'Are they?' 
            <p>'But do you really mean, Sir,' demands Peter, 'that there could 
              be other worlds - all over the place, just around the corner - like 
              that?''Nothing is more probable,' the professor replies.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"title=""> 
            [1] </a> 
            <p>In a modernist analysis of the story, Peter probably would be called 
              a reasonable young man who was right to doubt his hyper-imaginative 
              sister Lucy. As for the professor, bless him, he must be well into 
              his second childhood. Modernists similarly compare the Vedic description 
              of worlds other than ours to the fantasies of children and dotty 
              senior citizens. Just because some devotee saw something he thought 
              was the spiritual world and his guru, by referring to some old book, 
              confirmed his disciple saw the spiritual world, doesn't make the 
              existence of the spiritual world certain. Another Latin phrase sums 
              up the modernist outlook: <i>de omnibus dubitandum </i>('doubt is 
              everything'). This was coined by René Descartes (1596-1650), often 
              called the father of modern philosophy. 
            <p>As every student of European philosophy knows, Descartes doubted 
              what he perceived with his senses; he also questioned the <i>ipse 
              dixit</i> authority of his education in the Greek classics. From 
              out of these doubts arose a certitude about his own being, which 
              he expressed in his famous maxim, 'I think, therefore I am'. Oxford 
              philosopher A. J. Ayer explains, 'The sense in which I cannot doubt 
              the statement that I think is just that my doubting entails its 
              truth: and in the same sense I cannot doubt that I exist.' (Ayer, 
              1956:45) 
            <p><strong>The modern method of thought </strong>
            <p>Doubt itself, then, formed Descartes' immediate, indubitable data. 
              From there he doubted his way to an understanding of the external 
              world, questioning at every step both his senses and the teachings 
              of previous authorities. His method looks natural and normal to 
              people today, but for his time it was a radical break from the Medieval 
              intellectual tradition. Descartes' method of systematic doubt marks 
              the starting point of scientific rationalism.</p>
            What would Descartes do with Lucy's story of Narnia? As he himself 
            wrote, 'In our search for the direct road to truth, we should busy 
            ourselves with no object about which we cannot attain a certitude 
            equal to that of the demonstrations of arithmetic and geometry.' (Descartes, 
            1701) In other words, the reality of a thing is to be certified by 
            a system of logical proof (<i>anumana</i>), like geometry. It is not 
            enough just for Lucy to see Narnia (<i>pratyaksa</i>), or even get 
            authoritative confirmation that she saw it (<i>sabda</i>). If <i>anumana</i> 
            certifies it, then Narnia exists even if Peter can't see it or didn't 
            learn about it in school. If <i>anumana</i> doesn't certify it, Narnia 
            doesn't exist, no matter what Lucy saw or the professor says. 
            <p>As physicist Paul Davies points out, Descartes' method of analytic 
              geometry is a historical antecedent to today's quantum physics, 
              which also promotes <i>anumana</i> over <i>sabda</i> and <i>pratyaksa</i><i>. 
              </i>(Davies, 1992:166) Like Descartes, the modern scientist relies 
              upon a system of mathematical logic to decide what is real and what 
              is not. And, like Descartes, he asserts that mathematical proof 
              overrides even direct perception. The old adage, 'seeing is believing', 
              is out the window. We cannot see quarks, black holes or space-time 
              worms, but the calculations tell us they exist - therefore they 
              are certain. 
            <p>The quantum Narnia As many of us may know from popular science 
              magazines and pocketbooks, quantum theory mathematically proposes 
              the existence of 'alternative worlds' that influence our own. (Davies, 
              1988:67) For example, suppose Lucy drops her claim of having directly 
              seen Narnia and instead tells her siblings, 'Physicists say that 
              the structure of everything rests upon mathematical laws. They also 
              say there are unlimited other universes in mathematical dimensions. 
              Given the infinite possibilities involved, I am completely certain 
              that in one of these other parallel universes is a place called 
              Narnia.' 
            <p>The professor concurs that she is right. Still Peter protests, 
              'Do you really mean, Sir, that there could be other worlds - all 
              over the place, just around the corner - like that?' 
            <p>'Nothing is more probable,' the professor replies. 
            <p>'Peter,' Lucy chimes in, 'you should pay attention to the professor 
              now. This is no fairy tale. It's <i>science. </i>You were right 
              to be dubious about the original form of my Narnia tale. But throw 
              in a little physics and hey presto. It's rather tame, actually. 
              We've heard so much about the quirky quantum world that by the mid-1990's, 
              Narnia is just cold pudding.' 
            <p>Many educated people today would tend to agree with Lucy. But Peter 
              remains dubious that the quantamised tale of Narnia is any more 
              credible. These are his reasons: 'Even if I say I believe you now, 
              I still don't get to see Narnia for myself. Quantum physics says 
              that the alternative worlds are completely disconnected from each 
              other. Communication between them is impossible. An individual cannot 
              leave one world and visit another, nor can we even glimpse what 
              life is like in all those other worlds. (Davies, 1988:137) Not only 
              can't you show me Narnia, you can't even give me a solid reason 
              for believing that Narnia exists, because as a kid I'll never be 
              able to work out the mathematics for myself. Admit it Sir, you're 
              asking me to swallow the same old <i>ipse dixit</i> proof as before!'
            <p>His voice kind and fatherly, the professor patiently says, 'Peter, 
              settle down. In the original tale of Narnia, Lucy's only evidence 
              was her direct perception. We can't trust that because, after all, 
              she's only human. But logic is more developed than perception. Therefore 
              the quantum explanation is superior. Since your perception is also 
              untrustworthy, you're not able to use it to question logic and mathematics. 
              Even if you can't understand the quantum method of logic, it has 
              an authority of its own, different from <i>ipse dixit</i> proof.' 
            <p>'Are you telling me the quantum Narnia has the certain authority 
              of truth?'
            <p>'Peter, I said nothing could be more probable. I didn't guarantee 
              that it is true. The point is that scientific logic has its own 
              authority that is worth your while to listen to and follow, young 
              man.'</p>
            'No doubt, Sir, scientific logic is more developed than the simple 
            words of a little girl, but it seems to me that you're the one missing 
            the point. If we simply <i>believe</i> scientific theories without 
            verifying whether they are true, we grant the scientists testimonial 
            authority over our lives, not just theoretical authority. Theoretical 
            authority means I'm giving you a hearing just for argument's sake; 
            I may accept what you say or not. But testimonial authority supposes 
            you to be speaking real facts that I, as a schoolboy, ought to take 
            seriously if I want knowledge. You admit you cannot guarantee that 
            what you are saying about Narnia is true, there is no evidence by 
            direct perception that Narnia is real, yet still you expect me to 
            grant you testimonial authority. But how can I be certain that what 
            you are telling me is true?' 
            <p>Self-evident authority To summarise, Peter and the professor disagree 
              whether logic has authority. The professor's position is that if 
              a statement is backed up by scientific logic (which he admits is 
              not necessarily true), it has authority and should be accepted as 
              testimony. Peter argues that logic in itself does not have the certain 
              authority of truth. He accuses the professor, and modern science, 
              of requiring schoolchildren like himself to believe in theories 
              about unseen things like Narnia as if they were true. This is just 
              the sort of <i>ipse dixit</i> authority that Descartes rejected. 
            <p>Peter's objection to the authority of logic is well worth marking. 
              A notorious problem of modern systems of reason is that their claims 
              to authority are beyond reason. For example, what is the reason 
              for the professor's argument that logic is the better method to 
              certitude? The professor admits that logic does not guarantee truth. 
              He speaks in terms of probability instead. But if the truth cannot 
              really be guaranteed through logic, then how can we establish whether 
              something is even true? Therefore, the professor's argument for 
              logical certification of knowledge is not at all reasonable.<a href="#_edn2"name="_ednref2" title=""> 
              [2] </a> If his reason for the authority of logic is without reason, 
              he is not really making an argument. Rather, he is putting forward 
              an axiom: 'Logic has authority because I say so.' 
            <p>Why should we accept his axiom because he says so? This is the 
              essence of Peter's challenge. In the same way, the reason for granting 
              authority to sense perception (<i>pratyaksa</i>) cannot be defended 
              from sense perception itself. Our senses are limited. They cannot 
              prove that there is no reality beyond their limits of perception. 
              Thus there is no firm reason for giving final authority to sense 
              perception in questions of certitude. 
            <p>Like Peter, Vedic <i>pramana</i> distinguishes between logic and 
              testimonial authority. The word <i>sabda</i> means 'sound', but 
              the <i>sabda</i> that is cited as authoritative Vedic testimony 
              is <i>sabda-brahmana</i><i>,</i> spiritual sound. It is in a category 
              by itself, distinct from <i>anumana</i> (logic) and <i>pratyaksa</i> 
              (direct perception). Spiritual sound, as opposed to ordinary sound, 
              is <i>svatah-pramana</i><i>. </i>That means its authority is self-evident; 
              it does not derive it from another <i>pramana</i><i>. Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>(6.3.19) points out the essential difference between speech 
              that carries self-evident authority, and speech that does not.

            <p>What Krsna says has the full authority of truth. Krsna Himself 
              is the Supreme Truth, the Param Brahman. <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (10.12-3) 
              states that great sages like Asita, Devala and Vyasa 'confirm' this 
              truth. That does not mean that the truth Krsna speaks depends upon 
              the confirmation of others. The sages confirm they know the truth 
              by repeating what Krsna says. Thus they are also accepted in the 
              <i>Vedas</i> as authorities whose words are always true, because 
              their authority derives from Krsna. Apart from this, sages, demigods, 
              angels, human beings and demons have no self-evident authority. 
            <p>Similarly, sense perception and logic have no self-evident authority; 
              they depend upon <i>sabda</i><i>. </i>For instance, I perceive that 
              people die. Logical doubt impels me to ask whether every human being, 
              including myself, will also die. But my senses and mind cannot answer 
              that with certitude. I must turn to authoritative testimony. After 
              learning from this that I and everybody else will indeed die, logical 
              doubt then forces me to ask, 'what is the use of this life?' As 
              before, the senses and mind cannot give me a certain answer. Only 
              <i>sabda</i> has that authority. 
            <p><i>Anumana</i> can help us form a logical basis for a belief in 
              worlds other than our own, as quantum physics does. But logic cannot 
              even bring us to the realisation, with complete certainty, of other 
              worlds in a different material dimension, let alone the certain 
              realisation of transcendental worlds in the spiritual dimension 
              (Vaikuntha). The spiritual dimension is self-evident only via the 
              medium of <i>sabda</i><i>,</i> pure Vedic sound as transmitted by 
              Krsna and His authorised representatives. On the other hand, sound 
              spoken by someone who has no self-evident authority, who does not 
              refer to Krsna and who derives authority from <i>pratyaksa</i> and 
              <i>anumana</i><i>,</i> is not <i>sabda</i><i>. </i>If we parrot 
              such empty sound as <i>ipse dixit</i> evidence, it certifies nothing. 
            <p><strong>Problems of self-referential logic </strong>
            <p>Are we, who adhere to Vedic philosophy, being too credulous when 
              we quote <i>sabda</i> as certain proof? Is there any rationality 
              whatsoever in the concept of self-evident authority? Well, Descartes 
              is still famous as a great rationalist. The central theme of his 
              philosophy, the so-called Cartesian principle, is that <i>anumana</i> 
              bears self-evident authority. He believed that the mind, by referring 
              to itself<i> </i>alone, can arrive at the fundamental certainties 
              of existence: I exist, God exists, and geometric logic is intrinsically 
              superior to all other types of knowledge. Nowadays it is fashionable 
              for philosophers to reject Descartes' arguments for the existence 
              of the soul and God, as simply a result of his Christian upbringing. 
              Still, the basic theme of the Cartesian principle, that the mind 
              must decide for itself what is true and what is not, is an almost 
              obligatory dogma in the West. In Western philosophical language, 
              truth that the mind finds within itself alone is called <i>a priori, 
              </i>self-evident.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [3] 
              </a> If the truth about everything is knowable only by logical doubt, 
              then truly, <i>de omnibus dubitandum, </i>"doubt is everything." 
            <p>Descartes tried to establish his self-referential principle by 
              equating thought ('I think') with the self ('therefore I am'). To 
              the Christian that he was, 'I am' meant 'I am an eternal soul, different 
              by my thought from matter'. His basis of certitude was formed by 
              this sense of non-physical identity. From that basis, he devised 
              his 'indubitable' Cartesianism. But all his maxim really says with 
              any certitude is, 'I am thinking now, therefore I exist now'. The 
              self does not always engage in thought. Sometimes it is completely 
              unconscious, as during dreamless sleep. If thought or logical doubt 
              is the self's nature, and thought is not always, then it does not 
              follow that the self is always. 'I think, therefore I am' is no 
              more or less valid a statement than 'I sleep, therefore I am not'.' 
              <i>Anumana</i><i>, </i>then, does not self-referentially establish 
              a certain ground of eternal existence. 
            <p>A second problem is that self-referential logic leads to paradox. 
              Everyone who regularly uses a computer has experienced a 'hang', 
              when the computer gets stuck in a function and cannot execute further 
              commands. The only remedy is for the operator to reset the system. 
              A 'hang' happens when the computer slips into a logical loop that 
              keeps referring back to itself. In the same way, our minds slip 
              into a logical loop as we consider Descartes' own central theme: 
              doubt is everything. If the statement is true, it is false, because 
              by asserting that doubt is everything, it leaves no doubt about 
              what everything is. But if it is false, then it is true, because 
              the falsity of the statement provokes doubt in everything once more. 
              Yet again, if it is true, it is false; but still, if it is false, 
              it is true ... on and on without end. There is no way out of the 
              loop because the logic of the statement has only itself to refer 
              to. This strongly suggests that for logic to be meaningful, it must 
              be directed by truth beyond itself, just as a 'hang' must be reset 
              by an operator external to the computer itself. Truth, then, is 
              something beyond <i>anumana</i><i>.</i> 
            <p>A third problem is that Descartes himself could not put into practice 
              the tenet of self-referential <i>anumana</i><i>. </i>He did experiments 
              to test his theories, resorting to observation (<i>pratyaksa</i>) 
              to support his <i>anumana</i><i>.</i> 
            <p> <strong>I am not the mind </strong>
            <p>Descartes' intentions were pious. With his maxim, 'I think, therefore 
              I am', he offered everyone a simple method of self-realisation which 
              he believed certified our identity as soul. He hoped his method 
              of logical analysis would put religion on a rational footing. Unfortunately, 
              his method does not really lead to self-realisation, because it 
              confuses the soul with the mind. 
            <p>Vedic <i>sabda</i> reveals truths the mind is unable to discern 
              by referring to itself. One such truth is that the mind is a subtle 
              material covering of consciousness, something like a cloud of smoke 
              hanging around a flame that is not burning cleanly. The flame is 
              comparable to the soul, for the flame spreads its light like the 
              soul spreads consciousness. A flame that is not burning cleanly 
              is like a soul in <i>maya</i><i>,</i> the state of forgetfulness 
              of Krsna. From the soul in <i>maya</i><i>, </i>the mind arises, 
              like smoke rising from a flame. Smoke and flame are closely associated 
              yet have opposite qualities: flame gives light, while smoke obscures 
              light. 
            <p>The mind is called <i>cancala</i> in Sanskrit, meaning 'unsteady'. 
              Sometimes it is awake, sometimes it dreams, sometimes it is in a 
              deep dreamless sleep. When the light of self-knowledge is obscured, 
              wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep delude consciousness. We therefore 
              make such false statements as 'I think', 'last night I dreamt', 
              'I was unconscious', and so on.  However, the flame of the self, 
              the soul, burns eternally, unaffected by this clouding of its light. 
              The unsteady mind is captivated by external sense impressions. Through 
              the mind and senses, the soul's attention is focused upon the ever-changing 
              material world. This misdirection of consciousness (the power of 
              the soul) turns <i>samsara-cakra</i><i>, </i>the wheel of birth 
              and death. 
            <p>The mind, having no self-informing capacity, is misinformed by 
              the imperfect senses. Illusioned by uncertain sense data, the mind 
              makes mistakes. When in spite of this, we stubbornly think we've 
              gained indubitable knowledge, we are cheated.   For example, suppose 
              you and I agree, on the basis of perception and logic, that 'one 
              plus one is two' is an undisputed fact. We form a school of philosophy, 
              the Too True To Two school. We challenge any other school to come 
              forward and prove that "one plus one is two" is not certain. The 
              losers have to give the winners all the money in their wallets except 
              one banknote. A member of the One On One Won school takes up the 
              bet. He places one drop of water on a flat glass surface with an 
              eyedropper, then carefully adds a second drop to it. The result, 
              to our chagrined surprise, is not two drops. We lose, cheated by 
              our own minds and senses. After giving away the money, I have one 
              dollar in my wallet. You have a ten dollar bill in yours. Pooling 
              our funds, we fall into a grave philosophical contradiction. My 
              senses tell me we now have two notes, but your mind tells you we 
              have eleven dollars. We quarrel. I shout, 'Believe your eyes! Two!' 
              You shout back, 'Believe your mind! Eleven!' Condemning one another, 
              we dissolve our school. 
            <p><b>How can we be certain about <i>sabda</i>?</b> 
            <p>The dispute over the two bills is not just comedy relief for readers 
              weary of epistemology. Friction between rationalists (who believe 
              their minds, i.e. logic) and empiricists (who believe their eyes, 
              i.e. the senses) has been a flashpoint of regular philosophical 
              controversy since classical times. Like unsupervised children, <i>pratyaksa</i> 
              and <i>anumana</i> quarrel whenever the authoritative parent <i>pramana</i><i>,</i> 
              Vedic <i>sabda</i><i>,</i> is absent. At the moment, <i>anumana</i> 
              has more weight in science than <i>pratyaksa</i><i>.</i> But as 
              with all trends of history, this will not last. Stephen Hawking 
              has this to say about the future of modern, non-Vedic <i>anumana</i><i>:</i> 
              'One theory builds upon another. We can't escape the suspicion that 
              we may be constructing a very ephemeral house of cards.' (Ferguson, 
              1994:65) 
            <p>Unfortunately, modern intellectuals equate Vedic <i>sabda-pramana</i> 
              with the sort of <i>ipse dixit</i> authority that Descartes rejected. 
              And so, despite their doubts, <i>anumana</i> remains the favoured 
              <i>pramana</i><i>, </i>though it is ever uncertain. But there are 
              three simple, standard rules of semantics (the study of linguistic 
              communication) that, if put into practice, demonstrate the difference 
              between <i>sabda</i> and <i>ipse dixit </i>statements, and establish 
              <i>sabda</i> as authoritative. If I want to know whether a statement 
              has real authority, I must:  
            <p>1. know what the statement means
            <p>2. know the right way to verify it</p>
            <p>3. have good evidence for believing it<sup> </sup>(Wilson, 1960:76)</p>
            Firstly, knowing what a statement means requires me to accept an appropriate 
            discipline of thought. For instance, I cannot know what 'nondeterministic, 
            polynomial-time-complete' refers to through the disciplines of basket 
            weaving, literary criticism or phrenology. The appropriate discipline 
            is combinatorics, the study of complex logical problems. Similarly, 
            if I want to know what the statement '<i>sabda</i><i> </i>is the sound 
            incarnation of Krsna' means, I have to accept the system of discipline 
            (<i>parampara</i>) through which <i>sabda</i> is handed down. 
            <p>Secondly, I verify the statement '<i>sabda</i><i> </i>is the sound 
              incarnation of Krsna' by consulting the three <i>parampara</i> sources 
              of <i>sabda</i><i>: </i>guru, <i>sastra</i> and <i>sadhu</i><i>. 
              </i>If I read this statement in <i>sastra</i><i>, </i>I consult 
              guru and <i>sadhu</i> for verification. If I hear it from guru, 
              it is verified by <i>sastra</i> and <i>sadhu</i><i>; </i>and if 
              I hear it from <i>sadhu</i><i>, </i>it is verified by <i>sastra</i> 
              and guru. 
            <p>Thirdly, there is very good evidence for believing the statement 
              '<i>sabda</i><i> </i>is the sound incarnation of<i> </i>Krsna'<i>. 
              </i>One who makes the senses and mind his authorities is bound by 
              them, and is thus bound by ignorance of the self. In other living 
              creatures such ignorance of the self is natural; but in man it is 
              a vice that results in vice. The sound of <i>Ipse dixit</i> does 
              not have the potency to free the self from the vicious demands of 
              the mind and senses. Hearing it, a man remains like an animal, his 
              life's goals no higher than eating, sleeping, sex and self-defence. 
              <i>Sabda</i> that is understood and verified following the  two 
              previous rules, transforms the hearer in a way that <i>ipse dixit</i> 
              does not. As Srila Prabhupada writes in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i><i> 
              As It Is</i>,<i> </i>'Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme 
              Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation.' (Bhaktivedanta, 
              1983:266) Liberation of consciousness from the dictation of the 
              mind and senses, and from ignorance and vice, is self-evident in 
              the devotees who take to the path. And when a devotee comes to the 
              end this path of liberation, of hearing Vedic <i>sabda</i><i>, </i>Krsna 
              personally reveals Himself as Absolute Knowledge, the Absolute Knower 
              and the Absolute Object of Knowledge. This state of full realisation 
              of the truth is called Krsna consciousness.

                  Don't scientists have more reasonable arguments that establish 
                  logic as authoritative proof? Stephen Hawking says that quantum 
                  theory is about 'what we do not know and cannot predict'. (Ferguson, 
                  1994:21) Ferguson furthermore notes, 'It is generally agreed 
                  that in science nothing can ever be "proved".' (Ferguson, 1994:26) 
                  About what he called 'knowledge concerning the universe as a 
                  whole',' the great philosopher-scientist Bertrand Russell (1912:82) 
                  wrote, 'the proposed proofs that, in virtue of the laws of logic 
                  such and such things <i>must</i> exist and such and such others 
                  cannot, are not capable of surviving a critical scrutiny.' Still, 
                  students in schools throughout the world must pass examinations 
                  on theories that scientists themselves admit are unproven. Why? 
                  The answer is that a theory is accepted not on the grounds of 
                  its certitude, but on the grounds that nobody has yet disproved 
                  it. 'The best anyone can say of a theory is that it has not 
                  been disproved.' (Ferguson, 1994:26) This principle forms the 
                  basis of modern scientific knowledge. This same principle, ironically, 
                  is considered a fallacy in classical philosophy: <i>argumentum 
                  ad ignorantium,</i> the fallacy of argument from ignorance. 
                  An argument that says something is true because nobody has proved 
                  it false, or that something is false because nobody has proved 
                  it true, is held to be invalid according to this rule of fallacy.
