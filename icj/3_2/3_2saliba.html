            <p><i>Although this paper was first published in 1986, it still speaks 
              to us today about Christian and Jewish responses to ISKCON.  In 
              it, Dr. Saliba discusses possibilities of dialogue between ISKCON 
              and other faith communities, and raises the concerns the Churches 
              may have, thus addressing some issues devotees may need to discuss 
              when meeting people from these faith communities. The spectre of 
              the Hare Krishna devotees recruiting young people from Christianity 
              and Judaism has been painted in many minds. But is it a true image? 
              Where does ISKCON draw the line between education and conversion? 
              These and other questions are raised by this interesting appraisal 
              of the relationship between ISKCON, Judaism and  Christianity.</i></p>
            <p>Over the last ten years, many religious leaders in the West have 
              expressed mounting concern about the new religious movements, in 
              which they see not merely an unexpected challenge to Judeo-Christian 
              tradition but an unprecedented threat to Western civilisation (Clements, 
              1975:16; Rudin and Rudin, 1980:14). Christian commentators on the 
              new movements worry about the magnitude of their impact on, and 
              the challenge they pose to, the Christian faith. Commenting on the 
              large number of people involved in the cults, Walter Martin (1980:17), 
              one of the leading spokesmen for evangelical Christianity, remarks, 
              'When we compare this to the vast number of unchurched or mainline 
              churched Americans, we can see that a distinct minority, the cults, 
              is significantly affecting the majority.' Bob Larson, president 
              of an organisation for Christian ministries in Denver, is much more 
              judgmental in his evaluation of the new movements and more worried 
              about their implications for the churches, believing (1982:22) that 
              'the appalling number of cult devotees who have left evangelical 
              ranks poses the crucial question, "How well is the Church training 
              its members to understand the foundation of their beliefs?"'</p>
            The Eastern religions are particularly singled out as dangerous by 
            some commentators because they offer a novel philosophy of life with 
            alternative solutions to some of the problems which the Church must 
            face in the twentieth century. [1] The presence of Eastern religions 
            in the West is taken as an affront to Christian theology and life. 
            Their comparative success has deep philosophical roots in our own 
            culture. Clements (1975:46), for example, argues that it is not surprising 
            to 'find a new interest in mysticism in our culture, for there is 
            a close epistemological link between existentialism and Eastern thought. 
            If Christians are to find a positive reply to these Eastern sects, 
            they must become involved in the contemporary debate on the problem 
            of knowledge.' 'The popularity of the Eastern sects,' he further maintains 
            (pp. 55-6), 'provides a needed imperative to Christians to work toward 
            a deeper theology and a deeper devotional life.' The impact of cult 
            membership on family life and the psychological effects upon the individual 
            are among the many other subjects raised in discussions on the cultic 
            phenomenon (Enroth, 1977:12). 
            <p>Similar concerns are brought to the fore by Jewish rabbis and community 
              leaders who contend that the danger to their tradition is greater 
              because Jews form a minority in a culture where many Christian missionary 
              groups have already been making attempts to convert them. Marcia 
              Rudin (1978:252) portrays the relevant Jewish position when she 
              states:
            <blockquote>
              <p>The survival of the Jewish people is not at stake - if we have 
                survived the Crusades and the Holocaust surely we can survive 
                these cults - but the existence of these groups and their popularity 
                does present a problem to the Jews. The loss of even a single 
                Jew siphons off a precious natural resource.</p>
            </blockquote>
            Headlines in Jewish community bulletins and newspapers further highlight 
            Jewish vulnerability to the cults,<a href="#_edn2"name="_ednref2" title=""> 
            [2] </a> which are allegedly recruiting Jews in disproportionate numbers.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> 
            [3] </a> Jewish continuity and survival, already endangered by intermarriage 
            and assimilation, are now facing the missionary activities of the 
            new religious movements (Isser and Schwartz, 1980:63; Kollin, 1980:32). 
            Pointing out that in Judaism the home has been the centre of worship 
            and religious festivals, Isser and Schwartz conclude (p. 64): 
            <blockquote>
              <p>Thus, threats to the family structure and its welfare - that 
                is, conversion, proselytisation, intermarriage - strike at the 
                heart of Jewish life, its beliefs, its social structure, its very 
                survival. Proselytisation, in short, has been perceived and is 
                still perceived as a continuing and durable enemy.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The cults, particularly 'Jews for Jesus', are seen as 'a warning 
              that the process of assimilation has passed beyond the danger point.' 
              (Kollin, p. 323). Some Jews have interpreted proselytisation by 
              the new cults as a sign of anti-Semitism (Bush, 1980:48) and fear, 
              somewhat paranoiacally, that 'what the Spanish Inquisition and Hitler 
              failed to do, the cults might.' (Isser and Schwartz, p. 72). Many 
              fear that some of the contemporary cultic groups potentially may 
              erupt into violent and suicidal behaviour, as did the People's Temple 
              (Zeitlin, 1984:5; Rudin and Rudin, 1980:28-9). Jewish leaders are 
              further worried by the increased evangelisation activities of Christian 
              missionaries whose explicit aim is to convert Jews. Rabbi Balfour 
              Brickner (1978:11) observes that a new spirit of confrontation is 
              replacing the co-operation of recent years. He writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The eruption of the previously quiescent missionary enterprise 
                has further exacerbated the mood of confrontation and endangered 
                inter-religious relations in this country. If at one time Jews 
                ignored these marginal missions to the Jews, feeling that to challenge 
                their puny efforts was beneath Jewish dignity, that is no longer 
                the case. The proliferation of pockets of Messianic Jews, Jewish-Christians, 
                and Hebrew-Christians in all of their guises has angered the Jewish 
                community, particularly on the two coasts, where there are heavy 
                concentrations of Jews and many of these groups have set up 'National 
                Headquarters' .... The Jewish community is using every means at 
                its disposal to fight back.</p>
            </blockquote>
            It must be conceded that the cults have raised many questions about 
            traditional Western values, and that the preoccupations of both Jews 
            and Christians are not without foundation. The fears and concerns 
            about cultic influence are, however, part of the problem, since inevitably 
            they are bound to affect the mutual relationship between cult devotees 
            and members of mainline religious groups. Examination of the various 
            Christian and Jewish reactions to the cults will help us understand 
            the new religions' place in, and impact on, Western culture and religion 
            and might suggest - positively or negatively - ways to begin to formulate 
            an appropriate response. 
            <p>This essay will concentrate on two possible religious responses 
              to the new movements, [4] namely, those of confrontation and dialogue. 
              It will begin by describing the more typical Christian and Jewish 
              reactions firstly to the cults in general and secondly to ISKCON 
              in particular.<a href="#_edn5"name="_ednref5" title=""> [5] </a> 
              It will finally suggest that within the Christian and Jewish communities 
              there are hints of a better, more enlightened approach to the cultic 
              phenomenon, an approach which is buttressed by contemporary developments 
              in the theology of religions. 
            <p> <strong>The cultic image</strong>
            <p> In an attempt to respond more effectively to the perceived threat 
              of cultic resurgence, Christians and Jews have laboured to draw 
              up a definition of a 'cult' and to outline its features. Christian 
              observers have largely opted for a theological definition: cults 
              are first and foremost religious systems which deny basic, orthodox 
              dogmas like the Trinity and which contradict Biblically revealed 
              truths like the divinity of Christ. Walter Martin, who heads the 
              Christian Research Institute in California, states (1980:16) that 
              a cult is 'a group, religious in nature, which surrounds a leader 
              or a group of teachings which either denies or misinterprets essential 
              Christian doctrine.' In a resource packet on the cults, the US Lutheran 
              Council states that 'a cult is a non-Christian sect (e.g. Hare Krishna) 
              or a non-Christian religious phenomenon or group (e.g. Unification 
              Church).' William Whalen (1981:4), a popular Catholic writer on 
              sects and cults, prefers the broader definition given by Charles 
              Braden (1951:xii): 'A cult is any religious group which differs 
              significantly in some one or more aspects as to belief or practices 
              from those religious groups which are regarded as the normative 
              expressions of religion in our total culture' (cf. Beck, 1977:29; 
              Schipper, 1982a:20; Larson, 1982:31-40; McDowell and Stewart, 1982:22 
              ff.; Lesvis, 1974:3 ff.). One example of a more detailed theological 
              evaluation of a cult is provided by the National Council of Churches 
              (no date), which turned down the Unification Church's request for 
              membership because it failed the test of Christian orthodoxy. 
            <p>Attached to some of these explicitly theological statements about 
              belief systems are several negative connotations. Cults are sometimes 
              judged to be counterfeit spiritualities and spurious religious systems 
              (Enroth <i>et. al.</i>, 1983:13). They are often explained as being 
              manifestations of satanic forces, and thus represent, metaphorically, 
              the cosmic struggle between good and evil which augurs the apocalyptic 
              end of time. Ronald Enroth (1977:202), an evangelical Christian 
              who teaches sociology, propounds this theology most vividly when 
              he writes: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>From the Christian perspective, the so-called new-age cults represent 
                the most recent manifestation of an age-old struggle - the battle 
                between good and evil, between God and God's adversary, Satan. 
                The phenomena described in this book are neither random nor accidental: 
                they are profoundly patterned. As simplistic as it may sound to 
                some, they indicate a demonic conspiracy to subvert the true gospel 
                of Jesus Christ through human agents whose minds have been blinded 
                by the evil one. (cf. Williams, no date: 2-3; Newport, 1978:10; 
                Saliba, 1981:460-1).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Not content with making merely religious evaluations of the new 
              cults, many commentators on the cultic scene invoke psychological 
              and sociological explanations to reinforce their theological statements. 
              From a psychological perspective a cult is said to be an exploitative 
              and deceptive system of brainwashing and mind control achieved by 
              heavy behavioural conditioning and hypnotic techniques.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> 
              [6] </a> Its effects are devastating: members have their thoughts 
              manipulated and their ego destroyed, forfeit their capacity for 
              logical thinking and lose contact with reality. They degenerate 
              into 'spiritual zombies' (Whalen, 1981:7). Cults are very demanding, 
              exacting heavy sacrifices which might include the neglect or refusal 
              of medical aid, thus adding numerous physical problems to the psychological 
              damage already caused by the narrow and restrictive environment 
              in which their members live (Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, n.d.:2-3).</p>
            The cults are also viewed as having a number of negative features 
            from a sociological point of view. One of their main characteristics 
            is the presence of an authoritarian leader who, by claiming divine 
            revelation or knowledge, exacts loyalty and submission from his disciples 
            (McManus and Cooper, 1984:114; McDowell and Stewart, 1982:27; Gundermann 
            <i>et. al.</i>, 1977:2; Kyle, 1981:94). Cults are therefore closely-knit 
            social groups or systems which are held together by extreme discipline 
            and regimentation. Their life is tightly structured and controlled 
            by their leaders (Rambo, 1981:11; Martin, 1980:17 ff.). Group solidarity 
            is enhanced by legalistic codes and esoteric beliefs (Larson, 1982:19-21) 
            and by the inculcation of a narrow mentality that separates and isolates 
            members from the outside world, which is depicted by the cult as a 
            hostile environment (Larson, p. 18; Pritchett, 1976:1; Kyle, 1981:94; 
            Beck, 1977:9). 
            <p>While the Christian description of a cult focuses mainly on the 
              issue of orthodoxy and heresy, the Jewish definition focuses mainly 
              on the purportedly negative psychological and sociological aspects 
              of cult involvement. Margaret Singer's theory (Singer, 1979:72; 
              West and Singer, 1980:32-46) that a cult is a manipulative group 
              which brainwashes its members by techniques of indoctrination, thought 
              control, and hypnosis, figures prominently in Jewish definitions 
              (cf. Davis, 1983:12; Schwartz, 1978:24; Schwartz and Isser, 1981:1, 
              8; B'nai B'rith International, n.d.). James Rudin, Assistant Director 
              for Inter-religious Affairs for the American Jewish Committee, adopts 
              the sociological definition that 'cults are deviant groups which 
              exist in a state of tension with society' (Rudin and Rudin, 1980:14) 
              and then goes on to list several frightening features of cultism, 
              including total allegiance to an all-powerful leader, a de-emphasis 
              on rational thought, deceptive recruitment techniques and complete 
              control of the followers' lives (p.20 ff.).</p>
            <p>Jewish writers as a rule do not compare in detail the Jewish faith 
              with the main tenets of the new religious movements, but they do 
              criticise them for believing that the end of the world is at hand 
              and for promoting a secretive and mysterious atmosphere (Rudin and 
              Rudin, 1980:25). The cultic philosophy is that the end justifies 
              the means (ibid.; Neff, 1979:23). In Jewish writings on cults, the 
              psychological features ascribed to cults and the social dynamics 
              which are believed to operate in them are almost identical to those 
              alluded to in Christian writings (Silver and Pash, 1977:33; Appel, 
              1983:3 ff.; Isser and Schwartz, 1980:68, 70; Rudin and Rudin, 1980:23-4).</p>
            <p>Anthropologist Willa Appel, while admitting that cults have a long 
              history and may be an evolutionary phase in the development of religions 
              or political movements, still voices a largely disapproving opinion 
              of the whole cultic phenomenon. She writes (p. 4):</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>By their very nature, cults alienate ordinary citizens, for they 
                defy the existing social order Seeing themselves as separate from 
                the rest of the world, with a separate ideology and a different 
                life-style, cult members stand in opposition to society, denying, 
                in a greater or lesser degree, its legitimacy. Believing themselves 
                to be different from and superior to the rest of the world, cult 
                members tend to ignore the rules that govern less exalted citizens. 
                At odds with society in the first place, this antagonism can easily 
                lead to confrontation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Why cults? </strong></p>
            <p>Given this extremely pejorative picture of cults, one wonders why 
              they would arise in the first place and why so many young adults 
              would even consider joining them. There are two broad reasons proposed 
              by Jews and Christians alike to explain the resurgence of new religious 
              movements and to account for their popularity. The first reason 
              concerns the general cultural and social conditions of Western civilisation, 
              and the second concerns the religious situation. </p>
            <p>Most writers agree that the high esteem placed on material values 
              is at the very root of the problem (Boa, 1979:6; Newport, 1978:10; 
              Martin, 1980:23; Silver and Pash, 1977:31-2; Medroff, 1982:52). 
              Many contemporary young adults have apparently lost faith in a society 
              where a mood of relativity predominates (Beck 1977:12) and where 
              scientific progress may have created more problems than it has solved 
              (Petersen, 1973:1218; Silver and Pash, 1977:31-2). Our society no 
              longer offers a base for building a community where love, fellowship 
              and acceptance are the norm (Beck 1977:13; Enroth, 1981:15; Short, 
              1977:31). Jewish writers in particular are preoccupied with family 
              life which they see eroding through lack of discipline and authority 
              (Appell, 1978:20; Fine, 1982:59; Isser and Schwartz, 1980:67, 72; 
              Adahan, 1981:36; Brickner, 1978:13; cf. Petersen, 1973:12).
            <p>These societal conditions psychologically affect many people especially 
              the young, who are experiencing the normal identity problems of 
              late adolescence (Gitelson and Reed, 1981:318; Rudin and Rudin, 
              1980:102-3; Schwartz, 1978:23). Alienation and loneliness are the 
              major problems which people have to deal with (Bush, 1980:46; Isser 
              and Schwartz, 1980:72; Davis, 1983:12; Schwartz, 1978:23; Boa, 1979:4). 
              Many dissatisfied people are searching for spiritual fulfilment 
              (Lochhaas, 1977b:10; Isser and Schwartz, 1980:67; Schwartz, 1978:23). 
              Some Christian writers have observed that the present mood in Western 
              culture has contributed to the success of Eastern religions, since 
              these have preserved values which the scientifically oriented West 
              has neglected (Boa, 1979:5, Newport, 1978:10) and since the West 
              has encouraged relativistic ideas, especially in religious matters 
              (Martin, 1980:30-1).</p>
            <p>The presence of the cults also indicates that all is not well with 
              Christianity and Judaism, both of which appear, in part at least, 
              to have failed. The result is that many people do not have their 
              religious aspirations fulfilled (Enroth, 1981:15; cf. Cox, 1977a, 
              esp. pp. 95 ff.), while others have a shallow understanding and 
              knowledge of their own religion (Beck, 1977:16-7; McDowell and Stewart, 
              1982:20; Editorial, <i>La Civilta</i> <i>Cattolica</i>, 1984:221). 
              Gordon Lewis (1977, pp. 9-10) writes that some of the older Christian 
              cults can also be applied to the contemporary cultic scene:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Christians must confess that often they have been impassive to 
                the economically and socially needy, the suffering, the sorrowing, 
                the unsaved. The enthusiasm and sacrifice of the cults shame us. 
                Their educational vision and their extensive use of modern methods 
                of propagandising the masses have left many of us far behind. 
                More diligent in caring and giving, they reveal elements of truth 
                and life we have neglected.</p>
            </blockquote>
            LaVonne Neff, an assistant editor at InterVarsity Press, argues that, 
            despite the fact that the negative features of cults are often underscored, 
            one must not forget that their very presence and success point to 
            some flaws and lapses within the Christian community. She observes 
            (in Enroth <i>et. al.</i>, 1983:197) that: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>Even in their excesses, many cults have features that Christians 
                should sit up and notice. Eckists hunger for contact with spiritual 
                reality. Baha'i's long for world peace. Mormons work to build 
                strong families. Jehovah's Witnesses are eager to tell others 
                about their faith. Devotees of Transcendental Meditation practise 
                spiritual discipline.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There is also agreement among Jews that Judaism has been too strongly 
              influenced by Americanisation, modernisation and secularism (Silver 
              and Pash, 1977:31-2; Isser and Schwartz, 1980:72; Kollin, 1980:31; 
              Jacobs, 1977:10), with the deplorable result that Jewish life has 
              been trivialised (Neff, 1979:24). One hears the constant lament 
              that Jewish education is both inadequate and insufficient (Isser 
              and Schwartz, 1980:67, 69; Gittelsohn, 1977:44; Brickner, 1978:13; 
              Rudin and Rudin, 1980:148-9; Rudin, 1978:357-8). Many Jews are Jewish 
              in name only (Kollin, 1980:27-8), while the spiritual life of Judaism 
              is judged by some to be at a low ebb (Dworkin, 1975: 14). Rudin 
              and Rudin (1980) forcefully assert that a better education in one's 
              faith is required in order to counteract the cults. They write (p.148) 
              that 'the historians' grades will be quite low when they evaluate 
              the little real spiritual substance found within our institutions,' 
              and (p. 149) that 'ultimately the core of the long-term response 
              to the cults must be increasing and deepening religious education 
              on all levels.'</p>
            <p><strong> Views of the Hare Krishna Movement</strong></p>
            <p> Public suspicion of cults in general has dominated most of what 
              Christian and Jewish writers have had to say about the Hare Krishna 
              movement. ISKCON is at times taken as an example of either a pagan, 
              un-Christian cult or of a deceptive, pseudo-religious group in which 
              brainwashing and other thought reform techniques keep members under 
              the strict control of a despotic ruler. </p>
            <p>Most Christian literature on ISKCON reveals a somewhat fundamentalist 
              theology of Eastern religions.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> 
              [7] </a> This position starts with the assumption that Christianity 
              is the only true religion and that all others are at best a distortion 
              of Christian doctrine and devotion. Revelation is restricted to 
              the Christian Bible and salvation is equated with membership in, 
              or formal allegiance to, the Christian faith. Many of the missionary 
              movements to the East have been, and still are, inspired by the 
              sincere conviction that non-baptised people are mired in sin and 
              ignorance and in need of redemption. More specifically, Hinduism 
              is presented as an idolatrous religious system to be shunned, if 
              not abhorred. Larson, in his <i>Book of Cults </i>(1982), gives 
              a short description of Hinduism in which he outlines briefly the 
              historical background of ancient Indian religion and its various 
              stages of religious development. 'Hinduism,' he informs us, 'might 
              be viewed as religious anarchy in action.' (p. 71). Many of its 
              beliefs are humanly degrading. Thus we are assured (p. 74) that: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Hindu has inoculated himself against empathy to his fellow 
                man. All the universe is <i>lila</i><i>,</i> God's cosmic game. 
                And pain and pleasure are not absolutes but an illusion. The suffering 
                one sees is not real, it is <i>maya</i> and therefore unworthy 
                of any efforts to alleviate. Furthermore, to extend kindness to 
                those who are less fortunate would be to disobey the law of karma.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Devotion to Shakti 'encourages orgies, temple prostitution and 
              animal sacrifices' (p. 75), and in honour of the goddess Kali a 
              hundred 'human sacrifice murders' are committed every year (p. 76). 
              The errors of Hinduism are clear (pp. 81-2):</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The polytheistic and idolatrous practices of Hinduism are pagan 
                forms of worship and constitute collusion with demonic forces. 
                Karma's system of salvation-by-conduct is contrary to the biblical 
                doctrine of salvation by the sole grace of God. The Hindu cannot 
                acknowledge his need of a saviour without repudiating his entire 
                belief system.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Relying heavily on Stillson Judah's (1974) study on ISKCON, most 
              of the current commentators on the movement start by placing it 
              within the framework of the Hindu religion, more specifically within 
              the Hindu fundamentalist tradition (Lochhaas, n.d.:4; McBeth, 1977:21 
              ff.; cf. Marchand, 1978:39).</p>
            The first and strongest attack on the Hare Krishna movement is directed 
            against its basic teachings. ISKCON is a religion of incredible myths 
            and fantastic doctrines which are irrational and primitive (<i>Jesus 
            People USA</i>, 1979; Larson, 1982:3; Editorial, <i>La Civilta Cattolica</i>, 
            1984:220-1). Its beliefs are inconsistent (Martin, 1980:99; Sparks, 
            1979:111-2) and its philosophy unrealistic, unintelligible and absurd 
            (Oxley, 1976b:12; Petersen, 1973:172; Streiker, 1978:95; McBeth, 1977:3132). 
            It is nothing but a 'religion of despair' (McBeth:44). Moreover, the 
            movement is seen as a challenge to Christianity because of its claim 
            that it has no desire to change people's religion (Clements, 1975:27), 
            while still maintaining its universal missionary goal and proposing 
            Krishna consciousness as the fulfilment of Christianity (McBeth, 1977:36). 
            Its assertion that it is compatible with the Bible and Christianity 
            is categorically denied (Martin, 1980:18, 32; McDowell and Stewart, 
            1982:54). On the contrary, most, if not all, of the beliefs of the 
            Bible cannot be reconciled with the teachings and practices of ISKCON.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> 
            [8] </a> Commentators disagree whether or not the devotees of Krishna 
            consciousness practise idolatry.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"title=""> 
            [9] </a> 
            <p>Another common attack against the Hare Krishna movement focuses 
              on their mantra chanting which, besides being unbiblical (Means, 
              1976:156-7), is the method by which the devotees are brainwashed 
              and kept in a state of trance and mind-control (McBeth, 1977:34, 
              37; Newport, 1978:32; Means, 1976:148-50; Verghese, 1977:62; Streett, 
              1984:5; Hughes, 1983:318). ISKCON's monastic life has also been 
              severely criticised. Their sexual restrictions are deemed frustrating 
              and degrading (Sparks, 1979:114), their vegetarian cuisine is malnutritious 
              (Marchand, 1978:38), their structured daily schedule leaves them 
              practically no personal responsibility (Wood, 1975:8) and temple 
              living is a life of bondage (Sparks, 1979:105). Some argue that 
              the rigid discipline is just a way of maintaining the state of mind-control 
              (ibid.104; Newport, 1978:35-7; Streiker, 1978:87). Such a system, 
              which dominates the intellectual and emotional life of devotees, 
              requires an absolute leader, who is perceived by several writers 
              as an unscrupulous person who assumes divine power, if not divine 
              nature (Means, 1976:153; Editorial, <i>La Civilta Cattolica</i>, 
              1984:221). Swami Prabhupada, like so many other gurus and religious 
              leaders, has been accused of being inaccessible to his own devotees 
              and of living a life of leisure and luxury (Boa, 1979:180). His 
              followers, presumably following his instructions or example, are 
              deceptive in their fund-raising efforts (Enroth, 1977:26; Martin, 
              1980:91; Lochhaas, 1977a:11-2). Yamamoto (1983), however, gives 
              a much more objective and dispassionate account of ISKCON and its 
              founder, whose movement, he thinks, is certainly not a 'rip-off'. 
              McBeth (1977:43) concurs.  In addition, it is felt by some critics 
              that by maintaining such a monastic and communal lifestyle, Hare 
              Krishna devotees 'have dropped out of the world' (Petersen, 1973:140) 
              and have lost all interest in works of charity and in social issues 
              (Whalen, 1981:90; Leazer, 1981:56). ISKCON has been sharply criticised 
              for undermining the traditional family system (McBeth, 1977:39) 
              and for creating and encouraging tensions between devotees and their 
              parents (Verghese, 1977:53; Streiker, 1978:87; Lochhaas, n.d.:3). 
            <p>Mixed opinions are voiced about the way the children are educated. 
              Some think that children of devotees are deprived of their parents' 
              love and care (Sparks, 1979:107), while others assert that schoolchildren 
              see their parents on a daily basis (Sandlin, n.d.:l42).
            <p>This rejection of society has the effect of making the devotees 
              rather hostile (Marchand, 1978:39). For Aagaard (1983:20-1), who 
              from his base in Denmark has been fighting the cults the world over, 
              the Hare Krishna movement is essentially a violent one. The stockpiling 
              of weapons, especially in their West Virginia temple, is taken for 
              granted (McManus and Cooper, 1984:132).</p>
            <p>The Jewish response to the Hare Krishna has been less thorough. 
              ISKCON is regularly presented as a typical example of a destructive 
              cult, and little time or effort is spent in refuting its religious 
              doctrines or demeaning its rituals. Hence one will not find in Jewish 
              literature in-depth comparisons between ISKCON and Judaism. What 
              religious criticisms one does find indicate that ISKCON's philosophy 
              and practices are incompatible with Judaism (Isser and Schwartz, 
              1980:69). The charge that Hare Krishna devotees actually worship 
              false gods or idols is stressed particularly by religious Jews. 
              Fisch (1984:155), describing ISKCON religious services, states that 
              they 'consist of the worship of statues which represent the tens 
              of gods venerated by Hindus. There is a god of rain, a god of lightning, 
              a god of the ocean and a god of morning. There are gods for everything 
              under the sun.' In an account of the deprogramming of a Jew who 
              had been a member of ISKCON for five years, one of the deprogrammers 
              confronts him with a clear denunciation of the type of worship he 
              thinks takes place in the movement's temples (Hecht, 1985:80-1):</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Abraham became the first patriarch of the Jewish people after 
                he had broken the clay statues that his father worshipped as idols. 
                I am sure those people also had philosophies. Nevertheless, they 
                worshipped idols. You can spout out all the philosophy you want. 
                The bottom line is, you are an idol worshiper. You make a statue, 
                call it god, and worship it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            This idol worship is said to extend to include their now deceased 
            leader (Yanoff, 1981:1 19). 
            <p>Krishna devotees are further criticised for behaving like social 
              outcasts. They avoid the ordinary pastimes of American culture like 
              sports and watching television and, above all, they are forcibly 
              cut off from their families (Rudin and Rudin, 1980:51). To many 
              Jews ISKCON is a hostile, dangerous group, its West Virginia temple 
              being a weapons cache (cf. ibid:54; Fisch, 1984:145). Some (e.g., 
              Yanoff, 1981:208-10) find the devotees deceptive in their soliciting, 
              while others (e.g. Silver and Pash, 1977:32-3) disagree and point 
              out that their 'religion is not corrupt or exploitative'. 
            <p>The most serious charge brought by Jewish writers against ISKCON 
              is probably that of brainwashing. Rudin and Rudin (pp.17-8) express 
              this common viewpoint when they adopt Conway and Siegelman's theory 
              of conversion to cultism In agreement with their Christian counterparts, 
              Jewish commentators on ISKCON think that the devotees are first 
              brainwashed and then maintained in a state of indoctrination by 
              the continuous repetition of the Hare Krishna mantra, aided by a 
              regimented life which lacks nutrition and medical care (ibid. 46, 
              51). Though Rudin and Rudin admit that many of the Hare Krishna 
              devotees 'appear to be happy' (p .48), they still conclude that 
              there are many 'vegetables' and 'basket cases' in their temples 
              (p. 52). 
            <p>The above is a rather grim and foreboding picture of Hinduism and 
              of ISKCON, and one wonders why it is so prominent in Christian fundamentalist 
              and Jewish literature, especially since scholarly works present 
              an altogether different picture of the religious traditions of the 
              East and of ISKCON. One can suggest several reasons why the presence 
              of the Hare Krishna movement has aroused such a diatribe (here I 
              will focus my comments on the Christian response). 
            <p>First of all, it must be borne in mind that the presence of an 
              evangelising branch of Hinduism in the West has brought about a 
              clash of ideologies. ISKCON is seen as competing for unchurched 
              Christians and as attracting and influencing regular church members. 
              The apologetic reply, which defends one's own position and attacks 
              the opponent's theological system, is a predictable reaction under 
              the circumstances. Secondly, authoritative knowledge of Eastern 
              religious traditions has, in the main, been restricted to scholars 
              in colleges and universities. Evangelical Christians reacting to 
              ISKCON have been labouring with little in-depth knowledge of Hinduism 
              and lack the intellectual and academic tools to distinguish the 
              spiritual essentials of Hinduism from its cultural accretions. Thus, 
              Larson (1982:79) reports on the costly care which some temples in 
              India give to 'sacred rats' or to the worship of deadly cobras, 
              but fails to make any attempt to determine what these practices, 
              if actual, mean to the average believer or to find out what place 
              such customs have in the religion as a whole. A religion should 
              not be judged by what may be the idiosyncratic or esoteric beliefs 
              and practices of a minority of its members. Thirdly, those responding 
              to what they perceive to be a serious threat from ISKCON have yet 
              to realise the critical importance of developing a systematic theology 
              of religions, and hence they find themselves without the theological 
              concepts necessary to interpret ISKCON's religious beliefs and practices. 
            <p><b>Who joins ISKCON and why?</b> 
            <p>Reading the negative accounts about the Hare Krishna movement, 
              one is left wondering why anybody would decide to commit oneself 
              to such an ostensibly harmful organisation. To many, the strict 
              lifestyle of a devotee is repulsive rather than attractive. In an 
              age which embraces scientific explanations of the world and of human 
              life, it seems incongruous that ISKCON would achieve any success 
              in the West. In a society where the pursuit of pleasure has become 
              the overriding goal, one may find it hard to understand how anyone 
              could be attracted to a group where the denial of personal comfort 
              and pleasure is an integral part of life. 
            <p>Probably the most frequently heard explanation for why young adults 
              are attracted to the movement is that it provides an alternative 
              to a materialistic culture.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> 
              [10] </a> Western society has become dominated by scientific technology 
              and consumerism, which stress material comforts and ignore spiritual 
              needs and aspirations. This has led to anxiety and disillusionment 
              and to the desire to escape to a less worldly environment. ISKCON 
              offers an anti-materialistic life-style in which attachment to material 
              goods is overcome and the competition for material success abates. 
            <p> A second reason advanced for the spread of the Hare Krishna movement 
              is the earlier existence of the counterculture. Judah (1974:61) 
              points out that the Krishna pre-converts had joined the counterculture 
              of the 1960s and, finding it unsatisfying, continued searching for 
              an alternative lifestyle. Joining the Hare Krishna movement meant 
              that one was not only abandoning a lifestyle of drug abuse and sexual 
              indulgence but also expressing symbolically a rejection of American 
              values and family heritage (cf. Petersen, 1973:171, Boa, 1979:180; 
              Cox, 1983:45).A third reason for joining ISKCON is that young adults 
            have become disillusioned and frustrated with their churches or synagogues 
            (Editorial, <i>La Civilta Catrolica</i>, 1984:221; Fisch, 1984:165). 
            Lochhaas (1979:29-30) thinks that all converts to Eastern religious 
            groups were either religiously uncommitted or minimal believers. Cox 
            (1977b) suggests that 'perhaps Christianity and Judaism have allowed 
            themselves to be identified with the values of accumulation, profit, 
            performance, success and material gain.' With little or no attachment 
            to the tradition of their upbringing, it is not surprising that many 
            young adults are looking for alternative ways of achieving self-realisation 
            and spiritual liberation (Boa, 1979:180; Schipper, 1982b:49). The 
            desire for a more intimate experience of God is also one of the factors 
            which leads people to look outside the traditional churches. ISKCON 
            appears, therefore, to have provided some young people with spiritual 
            values which they had abandoned or never really possessed. 
            <p>Several sociological and psychological reasons are also adduced 
              to explain the success of the Hare Krishna movement. In an age and 
              culture where both family life and authority are disintegrating, 
              those who join the movement find warmth and friendship in a supportive 
              community where the lines of authority are clear and firm, and where 
              people can express and share religious goals (Lochhaas, n.d.:8; 
              Whalens 1981:90; Shinn, 1983:91 ff.; Enroth, 1977:120). 
            <p>Becoming a member of ISKCON may appear to be sociologically advantageous, 
              but for some Christian writers, it is not so from a psychological 
              point of view. The typical profile of a young adult who enters the 
              Hare Krishna movement is that of a distraught and disturbed person 
              who has lost his / her relationship to tradition. Alienated from 
              society and religion, such a person is unable to cope with life. 
              With little strength and imagination and with no ambition (Streiker, 
              1978:72), he / she tends to be lonely and isolated (Boa, 1979:181). 
              The success of ISKCON, therefore, depends on maladjusted and discontented 
              people who are vulnerable to the strong and overbearing advances 
              of enthusiastic devotees. Membership in the group does nothing but 
              hide or aggravate this condition. 
            <p>The negative caricature of the Hare Krishna movement is marred 
              by ignorance, misunderstanding and misinterpretation both of its 
              practical goals and its theoretical background. The Spiritual Counterfeits 
              Project's leaflet on the movement, for instance, states that 'in 
              the literature of the Hare Krishna movement one may search in vain 
              for a systematic philosophy.' Commentators highlight the distinctly 
              non-Western practices of the movement, giving the impression that 
              the group is bizarre and that its members are in need of psychiatric 
              care. Ethnocentric bias is at times a little too obvious (cf. Lenneb, 
              1974). In an otherwise moderate article, one writer remarks that 
              he 'found the food, well, hard to recognise' (Sandlin, n.d.: 141), 
              while another admits that 'we find them strange - or even to speak 
              with prejudice - stupid.' (Oxley, 1976:4). Unfortunately, attempts 
              to understand the behaviour of members of new religious movements, 
              to correct misrepresentations and to provide a more balanced view 
              are frequently met with the accusation that one is an apologist 
              for the cults (Quebedeaux, 1981:18).
            <p><strong>Balanced views of ISKCON</strong></p>
            <p> In spite of the prevailing tendency to see the new religious movements 
              (ISKCON included) in a negative light, there are several Christian 
              and Jewish writers who are aware that sweeping statements on the 
              cults, condemning them one and all, are unrealistic. McManus and 
              Cooper (1984:45-6), for example, admit that even though members 
              have been conditioned, voluntary defection from the cults is common. 
              This conditioning, they state, is not so complete as to render them 
              mindless robots. Brainwashing may not express what actually happens 
              in a cult where the processes of recruitment and commitment involve 
              no physical coercion (Kyle, 1981:98; Rambo, 1981:11; Cox, 1983:50 
              ff.). It is possible that those who talk of brainwashing may have 
              little understanding of spiritual life and of religious conversion 
              (Touchet, 1980:339-40). </p>
            <p>Earl Schipper (1982a:10,11) admits that it would be unfair to associate 
              many of the new religious groups with the popular notion of a cult 
              as a system of brainwashing and deception controlled by a leader 
              who abuses power. Observing that to many people the word 'cult' 
              brings to mind the ill-fated People's Temple of Jim Jones, he admits 
              that 'while certain religious groups may, in fact, exhibit bizarre, 
              unacceptable behaviour, it would be unfair to associate some of 
              the religious groups we will study with these outrageous practices.'Several 
            authors (Garvey, 1977:24; McManus and Cooper, 1984:55ff; Newport, 
            1978:38; Short, 1977:31; Gruen, 1984) question whether deprogramming 
            is the best way, legally or religiously, to deal with cults. The US 
            Lutheran Council (1977) has expressed serious reservations about deprogramming. 
            A statement on the subject warns that one 'should be aware that there 
            are deprogramming efforts which can be as destructive as the cult 
            experience and which can also be illegal acts.' Philip Lochhaas (1977c:39), 
            the Executive Secretary of the Commission of Organisations of the 
            Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, warns parents of cult members to 'beware 
            of professional deprogrammers who charge large amounts of money to 
            get your child out of the cults'. Though Lochhaas does at times seem 
            to endorse deprogramming as a final resort, in an undated 'Open Letter 
            to Families of Those Caught in Religious Delusion' (n.d.:2-3) he clearly 
            states: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>There are a number of reasons why professional and forcible 'deprogramming' 
                of cult adherents is not recommended. In the first place, there 
                are legal and moral implications that must be considered seriously 
                by a Christian parent. Secondly, attempts at forcible deprogramming 
                often confirm in the young person's mind what has been taught 
                him in the cult about parents being under the control of Satan. 
                Parents should not be misled by statistics that show a high success 
                ratio. Statistics also show that young people may eventually return 
                to the cult with more determination and conviction than before. 
                The danger is always present that forcible deprogramming may seriously 
                damage the mind of the youth.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Some Christians have begun to wonder whether cultivating a bellicose 
              attitude toward the new religions truly reflects their own genuine 
              commitment to Christian values. Yamamoto (1983:99) has expressed 
              this concern more forcefully than most writers. 'It is a sad commentary 
              on Christians,' he writes, 'when we followers of Christ look upon 
              Krishna devotees with ridicule and derision, remarking how weird 
              and strange they are. This is tragic in the context of Christ's 
              admonition that we are to be light to a dark world, salt to a starved 
              people and love to crying hearts.' (cf. Lochhaas, n.d.:3; Saliba, 
              1979:113 ff.).</p>
            <p>On the more positive side, several authors have stressed the need 
              to learn from the cults (Wilson, 1978:135ff.; Saliba, 1982:483; 
              Rambo, 1981:24; Newport, 1978:40). Cults express the human concern 
              for authentic religious values and have a right to their belief 
              systems (Starkes, 1972:9).</p>
            It has also been conceded that there is some revelation in the Hare 
            Krishna movement. In a short article in a leading Italian Catholic 
            journal, Fonseca (1982), writing on the importance of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i><i> 
            </i>and its place in the spiritual life of India and of the Hare Krishna 
            movement, states (p. 46) that 'one must read the <i>Gita</i> with 
            a spirit of profound sympathy and with a serious endeavour to hear 
            God's voice which responds to the desires of the human heart wherever 
            these desires and feelings are found.' (my translation). A universal 
            message of love (although in practice somewhat condescending at times) 
            is proposed as the correct Christian response (cf. Yamamoto, 1983:102). 
            <p>The Jewish reaction to the new movements also contains some balanced 
              reflections and attitudes. Israel (1980:34), for example, observes 
              that the Jewish community loses more young adults to suicide than 
              to the Hare Krishna movement. While the cults are a problem, they 
              are not the most serious one which Jews face in today's world (cf. 
              MalIer, 1981:31011; cf. Zakim, 1979). Although most cult leaders 
              are often accused of living a life of luxury, Srila Prabhupada is 
              sometimes excluded (Spiro, 1980:31). Not all hold that the chanting 
              of the Hare Krishna mantra causes and maintains brainwashing or 
              induces hypnotism (Yanoff, 1981:122; cf. Fine, 1982:62-3). Deprogramming 
              has been deplored as being non-Jewish in ideology. Haramgall (1977:17), 
              writing in the <i>American Zionist,</i> is quite uncompromising 
              in his negative assessment of deprogramming techniques.   He writes: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>It is shocking that parents, and especially Jewish parents, support 
                such actions and make use of these 'services'. Upon close examination, 
                deprogramming is seen to abuse the soul and body of its victims, 
                break their spirit, and deprive them of self-determination. It 
                also serves to lower the morals of victims and recruit new victims 
                to the deprogramming ranks, a highly questionable choice of profession. 
                Several testimonies reveal that the terrorist deprogrammers encouraged 
                the patronisation of prostitutes, free sex, drinking and generally 
                'living it up' as proof of 'normal' conduct.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <strong>Theology of 
            religions and ISKCON </strong> 
            <p>The above reflections by both Jews and Christians suggest that 
              there is something amiss with the public perception of, and reaction 
              to, the new religious movements. Many Christians and Jews have in 
              fact declared a kind of holy war against the cults, a war to be 
              waged either in counter-evangelism and / or in the courtrooms. Drastic 
              measures taken to combat the cults and to return their members to 
              the religious beliefs and practices of their parents often have 
              not been successful, nor have they effectively dealt with, much 
              less solved, the major issues acknowledged by both Christian and 
              Jewish writers which the presence of the new religious movements 
              have brought to the fore. Perhaps it is time another strategy be 
              tested.</p>
            Several authors have viewed the new movements in the context of an 
            increasingly pluralistic society in the West (Melton and Moore, 1982:93 
            ff.; cf. Hanson, 1977:15). Both Christians and Jews must now interact 
            with the adherents of Eastern religions on a scale never before encountered 
            in history. The rather exclusivistic tendency which has pervaded both 
            communities is now being questioned (Coward, 1985:1-45). Christians 
            and Jews are taking a broader ecumenical approach to other religions 
            and fostering a relationship of dialogue. In Christian theological 
            circles, now, one often builds a theology of religions on the assumption 
            that all religions share the same essential religious quest, recognising 
            that this quest has been expressed in diverse ways and that it may 
            have become somewhat blurred and distorted in the course of history.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> 
            [11] </a> While granting that there are serious differences which 
            divide communities of faith, many theologians now admit that revelation 
            and truth can be found to some degree in all religions. Mutual sharing 
            and collaboration on various fronts become the primary goals in the 
            relationship between the different religions. This ecumenical spirit 
            calls the Christian to give witness to his / her own faith, but not 
            in the manner of the heavy-handed evangelisation or proselytisation 
            that insists on the conversion of everyone. Dialogue between religions 
            becomes a fruitful source of mutual understanding leading to self-enrichment 
            and self-purification. 
            <p>A similar ecumenical spirit is found also among Jewish thinkers. 
              Since the Emancipation, Jews have been in frequent contact with 
              people of different faiths and, therefore, have felt the need to 
              develop new ways of responding to the plurality of which they are 
              a part. Mendelssohn (1969:66, 107), for example, argues that since 
              religious truth is imminent in human reason, it is available to 
              all religions. Jews do not possess the exclusive revelation leading 
              to salvation. He explains that the Mosaic law was meant to bind 
              the Jews to God and to unite them as a people. Both reason and the 
              need to safeguard freedom of conscience favour the existence of 
              a pluralistic world in which no one asserts his position over another. 
              Fackenheim (1973:173 ff.) points out that the insular mentality 
              of the ancient Jews vis-a-vis other religions was based on the fear 
              of idolatry. Today, however, no modern religion need be regarded 
              as idolatrous (in the sense of image-worship, where the one transcendent 
              God is not the intended object of worship). Since neither Hinduism 
              nor ISKCON, then, must necessarily be considered idolatrous, the 
              doors for dialogue and for better relationships are open.
            <p>Other Jewish scholars (Heschel, 1951:182; Bresslauer, 1978:17-19; 
              Agus, 1971:429) see religious diversity in a positive light, emphasising 
              the need for religions to maintain their unique identity, to renew 
              themselves and thus to contribute to the collective spiritual resources 
              of humanity. The world's religions are a concrete witness of the 
              many ways human beings can respond to God. Because religions share 
              at least some common beliefs, goals and practices, they should act 
              as partners and join forces in a spiritual battle against secularity 
              (Bresslauer, p. 17).</p>
            <p><strong>Dialogue with ISKCON </strong></p>
            <p>There seems to be no reason why the Hare Krishna movement cannot 
              be included in this ecumenical framework (Mojzes, 1981; Eck, 1983). 
              Despite attacks against the new religious movements and ISKCON, 
              both Christian and Jewish literature contain evidence that a better 
              understanding of, and relationship with, the Hare Krishna movement 
              is both possible and desirable. </p>
            <p>Several Christian writers have pointed out that there are similarities 
              between Christianity and ISKCON. Charismatic and conservative Christians 
              insist on a literal interpretation of scripture, adopt a rather 
              anti-intellectual stance and stress the need of a direct religious 
              experience qualities found also in the Hare Krishna movement (Newport, 
              1978:39; cf. Pritchett, 1976:6). This common ground (cf. Newport, 
              p.163; Cox, 1983:27 ff.) can serve as a starting point for understanding 
              and co-operation. One of the more important points of contact is 
              monastic life (Wood, 1979:8; McCorkell, 1975:21; Cox, 1983:49-50). 
              Much of the ascetic life of the Hare Krishna devotees can be better 
              understood if compared either to the Christian monastic or puritanical 
              tradition.
            <p>Yamamoto (1978:21-2), in a widely circulated pamphlet on ISKCON, 
              argues as follows:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Before we discuss with Hare Krishna devotees the difference between 
                the two faiths, it is helpful, if not mandatory, to realise what 
                common ground Christians have with them. To know the similarities 
                will be of benefit in two ways. First, a smoother line of communication 
                will be set up, person to person, between Christian and devotee. 
                Second, deeper insight into the differences between Krishna and 
                Christ will be seen. Often by not taking the time and energy to 
                find points of agreement with others, we miss the true difference 
                in our position.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yamamoto mentions several points of contact between the Christian 
              and the Hare Krishna devotee: both are absorbed in a belief system; 
              both believe that only a Supreme Being can fulfil ultimate human 
              needs; both stress the need for a personal relationship with, and 
              devotion to, a saving God; both value a sincere commitment to a 
              cause and staunch dedication to holy scriptures. All these similarities 
              could form the basis for shared relations. One could fault Yamamoto 
              for seeking compatible elements between Christianity and ISKCON 
              for the purpose of more effective witness and evangelisation. Whatever 
              his intentions are, his suggestions are certainly a step forward 
              from the harangue and diatribe which have been typical of the popular 
              Christian evangelical reaction to the new religions and to ISKCON 
              in particular (cf. Yamamoto, 1978:22-3; Newport, 1978:167-8).</p>
            <p>The suggestion for dialogue has not usually been received with 
              great enthusiasm by evangelical Christians. Some doubt that any 
              dialogue is possible (e.g. Scragg, 1979:10). Given the theological 
              opinion that the new religious movements are a manifestation of 
              satanic influence, one can easily understand the reluctance of some 
              Christians to dialogue with members of ISKCON. Several Christian 
              writers, however, are becoming aware that ridicule is counterproductive 
              behaviour (e.g. Lochhaas, 1979:29; Saliba, 1979), intolerance is 
              hardly a Christian virtue (Pritchett, 1976:4) and diatribe is not 
              easily reconcilable with the Christian imperative of love. The judgement 
              that diabolic influences are so widely and successfully at work 
              is theologically weak because it brings into question both the wisdom 
              and love of a saving God.</p>
            These are but incipient and hesitant steps toward a better relationship 
            with a new religious group. The attempt to develop a theology of the 
            new religious movements, a project still in its infancy, faces several 
            real problems hich must be overcome if a more just evaluation of ISKCON 
            is to be achieved. The most serious obstacle to dialogue is the mutual 
            perception of sectarian proselytisation of both Christians and Hare 
            Krishna devotees. The very attempts at conversion are always bound 
            to be seen as a challenge, an affront which demands rebuttal. Most 
            of the major Christian denominations have ceased, without abandoning 
            their theoretical positions, to proselytise one another. The Christian-ISKCON 
            dialogue could perhaps be patterned on the model developed by the 
            World Council of Churches (cf. Samartha, 1979). The dialogue between 
            Christian evangelicals and members of the Unification Church (Quebedeaux, 
            1979) and the co-operation between various churches and the Unification 
            Church in the trial of Rev. Moon (Richardson, 1985), might serve as 
            other models which could change the current diatribe into a more positive 
            and fruitful relationship. 
            <p>Jewish writers have compared the Hare Krishna devotees with the 
              Hasidic Jews, especially in their views regarding authority, their 
              stress on community and their observance of strict rules (cf. Appell, 
              1978:23). Silver and Pash (1977:15-6) see a point of contact in 
              the Jewish <i>pinyele</i><i> yid, </i>the spark which exists in 
              every Jewish soul, and the Hare Krishna teaching that after one 
              makes contact with a spiritual master, a spiritual seed is planted 
              in one's heart. 
            <p>Brickner (1978), praising the Roman Catholic efforts to dialogue 
              with the Jews, approves the Church's clear and unequivocal repudiation 
              of proselytisation and states (p. 19) that 'Roman Catholicism has 
              had the courage to "mine" scripture and formulate a theology of 
              accommodation with Judaism that, while it fails to solve all problems, 
              does allow Catholicism to relate without equivocation to living 
              Judaism'. Many official and semi-official documents encouraging 
              a healthy relationship between Christianity and Judaism have been 
              put forth by religious bodies<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"title=""> 
              [12] </a> and these could conceivably help form the basis for the 
              development of a dialogue between Judaism and the new religious 
              movements. 
            <p>There are hopeful signs from within ISKCON itself that dialogue 
              might be a realistic possibility. Some of the movement's intellectual 
              leaders have already begun to make a contribution toward constructing 
              a foundation for dialogue with the mainline religious traditions 
              in the West (cf. Gelberg in this issue of <i>ISKCON Review</i>; 
              Bhaktipada, 1985; Schweig, 1985. Cf. also Rose, also in the present 
              issue of <i>ISKCON Review</i>).
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            The challenge of the Hare Krishna movement, from the perspective of 
            dialogue, is not one of competition for converts. The presence of 
            ISKCON in the West need not be seen as a fearful omen of the downfall 
            of Judeo-Christian tradition necessitating a call to Christians and 
            Jews to take up arms. History itself should assure us that this fear 
            is unwarranted. Judaism and Christianity, as well as Hinduism, have 
            survived for millennia in spite of the many problems they had to overcome 
            and the persecutions they had to endure. 
            <p>One would better start by looking at ISKCON as a spiritual venture, 
              with all the risks this view involves. There are reasons to believe 
              that most Hare Krishna devotees should be judged not as apostates 
              from the religion of their upbringing but rather as young adults 
              who are embarking on a religious journey for the first time. Krishna 
              devotees, on the other hand, should judge Christianity not by the 
              behaviour of those Christians who perhaps have not lived up to their 
              outwardly acknowledged commitment but rather by the saintly lives 
              and high aspirations which have been characteristic of many Christians 
              throughout the ages.The challenge of other religions in general, 
            and Hare Krishna in particular, can be seen positively as an opportunity 
            for self-growth and self-understanding which would lead one to rediscover 
            and build upon the richness of one's own tradition (Cox, 1983:60; 
            Saliba, 1983:17 ff.). The depths of our own faith can only be grasped 
            and the seriousness of our own commitment can only be fully apprehended 
            when we come face-to-face with other people who have sincerely accepted 
            a different theological framework and honestly made a different kind 
            of personal religious commitment. 
            <p>The presence of the new religious movements confronts us with the 
              greatest challenge of all: Can we come to terms with religious pluralism 
              without either compromising our religious identity or lapsing into 
              religious bigotry and persecution? Can we learn to appreciate other 
              religious beliefs and practices without necessarily doubting our 
              own faith? Do we have the magnanimity to embrace the whole of humankind 
              in our compassion and generosity, or will we allow our religious 
              ethno-centricity to isolate us from the fellowship of sincere adherents 
              of alternate paths? The genuineness of our own religious faith and 
              commitment can only be evaluated in the light of the answers we 
              give to these searching questions.<strong>References</strong>

              <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title=""></a><strong>Notes</strong></p>
              <p> [1] See Clements, 1975:44 ff.; Lochhaas, 1977a:11. Cox (1977b:91ff.) 
                and Wilson (1978:135 ff.) both deal at length with this issue 
                since they point out that there is much that Christianity can 
                learn from Eastern religions. Ross (1980) in her sympathetic presentation 
                of the Buddhist faith dwells on its beneficial attitudes toward 
                the environment and human work, attitudes which appear to be missing 
                or deficient in Christianity. </p>
              <div id=edn2>[2] Headlines like 'Jews' Vulnerability to the Lure 
                of the Cults', in the <i>Long Island Jewish World </i>(Dec. 6, 
                1981); 'The Hare Krishna Alerts Israel to Missionary Danger', 
                in the <i>Jewish Press,</i> Brooklyn, N.Y. (April 5, 1979); and 
                'Cults: A Growing Threat to Jewish Continuity and Survival in 
                America', in <i>Hakol</i><i>,</i> Allentown, PA (May, 1977), are 
                but a random sample of the disquietude which has been spreading 
                throughout the Jewish community. 
                <div id=edn3>
<p><a href="#_ednref3"name="_edn3" title=""> [3] </a>In general, 
                    Jewish sources believe that between 15-25% of all cult members 
                    are Jewish and that 15% of Hare Krishna members were brought 
                    up as Jews (cf. Adahan, 1981:37; Appell, 1978:20). Neff (1979:23) 
                    states that up to 45% of any given cult could be of Jewish 
                    background. Gittelson and Reed (1981:212) disagree and hold 
                    that Jews are not proportionately represented in the cults. 
                    The estimates vary, and there are no completely reliable statistics. 
                    At times Jews appear more concerned with the number of Jewish 
                    converts to Messianic Judaism (cf. Rudin, 1978:353-5).</p>
                  <div id=edn4> 4] The reaction to the cults has been studied 
                    under the rubric of the 'anti-cult movement' by Shupe and 
                    Bromley (1980), and pertinent historical and current literature 
                    has been surveyed by Bromley, Shupe and Oliver (1984). Briefly, 
                    these authors distinguish between a secular and a religious 
                    response to the cults and show how two metaphors, namely those 
                    of possession (or brainwashing) and deception are utilised 
                    to explain the rise of the cults and to develop an 'appropriate' 
                    reaction. In this paper our aim is to focus on the religious 
                    reactions (especially to ISKCON) and to examine the response 
                    to the cults of those who seek a theological explanation for 
                    their presence and success. Not all religious reactions to 
                    the new movements are 'anti-cultic'. 
                    <p><div id=edn5>
<p><a href="#_ednref5"name="_edn5" title=""> [5] </a>We will consider responses specifically from within the Christian and Jewish faiths. Thus we omit in this paper the anti-cult work of the American Family Foundation and the Citizens' Freedom Foundation and other secular organisations. Likewise, solely for the purposes of this paper, scholarly works by social scientists and religionists are not considered part of the Christian or Jewish response unless the authors make it clear that they are writing from a religious perspective. The major Protestant Churches and the Catholic Church have done very little officially to address the issue of the cults (Eck, 1983:14; Melton and Moore, 1982:104). The majority of writers from the above-mentioned traditions have, with some noteworthy exceptions, adopted a position on the cults similar to that of evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity.</p><div id=edn6>
<p><a href="#_ednref6"name="_edn6" title=""> [6] </a>These psychological effects are usually cited with little reference to justifying sources. None of the writers seem to have had more than casual contact with cult members (cf. Beck, 1977:7-10; McManus and Cooper, 1982:113-5; Larson, 1982:28; Meether, 1977:12; Uehling, 1976:12; Kyle, 1981:94; Enroth, 1983:17-8). The view which stresses the negative psychological aspects of a cult has received some official recognition (see statement issued by the Pennsylvania Conference on Interchurch Co-operation, 1979).</p><div id=edn7>
<p><a href="#_ednref7"name="_edn7" title=""> [7] </a>For a brief description and critique of this position see Knitter, 1985:75 ff.</p><div id=edn8>
<p><a href="#_ednref8"name="_edn8" title=""> [8] </a>This is a touchy issue, especially among fundamentalist Christians who restrict revelation to the Judeo-Christian scriptures. See, for example, Martin (1980:9699), McBeth (1977:45), Boa (1979:186), Means (1976:154-6), Yamamoto (1983:101), and Wood (1975:6-7). To what degree the Biblical argument is valid and effective can be debated (cf. Eck, 1983:13, who states that such arguments have no place in the dialogue between religions).</p><div id=edn9>
<p><a href="#_ednref9"name="_edn9" title=""> [9] </a>Larson (1982:289-290), for instance, states that the pagan worship in the Hare Krishna temples is plain idolatry. Verghese (1977:57) and McDowell and Stewart (1982:51) are of the same opinion. On the other hand, Yamamoto (1983:99) and Newport (1978:32) hold that the Hare Krishna devotees worship a personal God. Others, such as McBeth (1977:33), Martin (1980:96), Means (1976:151-2), and Sparkes (1979:95 ff.), see these beliefs as hovering between pantheism and theism. Lewis (1974:3) thinks that the ISKCON view of God is contradictory, containing theistic, polytheistic and pantheistic elements.</p><div id=edn10>
<p><a href="#_ednref10"name="_edn10" title=""> [10] </a>Almost every Christian writer on ISKCON mentions this reason. Confer, for example, Petersen (1973:171), Whalen (1981:90), Schipper (1982b:49), Senesi (1982:92), Boa (1979:180), McBeth (1977:29), Oxley (1976a:4), and Yamamoto (1983:91-2).</p><div id=edn11>
<p><a href="#_ednref11"name="_edn11" title=""> [11] </a>The literature on the Christian theology of religions is voluminous. See, for example, the works of Dawe and Carman (1978), Race (1982), Camps (1983), Clasper (1980) and Knitter (1985). Arinze (1985) gives an excellent summary of the Roman Catholic position and of the work carried out by the Vatican Secretariat for Non-Christians since Vatican II.</p><div id=edn12>
                                    <p><a href="#_ednref12"name="_edn12" title=""> 
                                      [12] </a>The most thorough collections are 
                                      probably those compiled by Croner (1977 
                                      and 1985). These documents represent statements 
                                      from diverse Christian churches all over 
                                      the world. For some Jewish perspectives 
                                      one can consult Croner and Klenicki (1979).</p>
