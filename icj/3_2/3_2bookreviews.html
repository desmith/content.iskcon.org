            <p><b>Justice, Courtesy and Love:<br>
              Theologians and Missionaries Encountering World Religions 1846-1914<br>
              </b><strong>Publisher: Epworth Press<br>
              Author: Kenneth Cracknell<br>
              ISBN: 0-716-20501-7</strong></p>
            New readers of <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i> elbowed by curiosity 
            into picking it up and reading it, may be confused as to why a western 
            Vaishnava publication such as this would publish a review of a book 
            about Christian missionaries written by a Methodist minister. 
            <p>Amidst the growing ranks of converts to the form of Vaisnavism 
              known today as the Krishna Consciousness Movement, there are a scattering 
              of several table-thumping fundamentalists who might go so far as 
              to claim that we have absolutely nothing to learn from Christianity, 
              either theologically or through accounts of their two thousand year 
              missionary history. To those who hold such views, or are persuaded 
              by others who hold them, I would simply say that if you think you 
              cannot learn from another religious practitioner, merely because 
              their faith is 'different', you may deny yourselves many vital instructions 
              and opportunities for spiritual development. God often chooses to 
              reveal Himself through the words of those of another faith particularly, 
              it seems, when we acquiesce to some platform of comfort or stagnation 
              within our own tradition. And that, to me, is what this book is 
              all about.<i>Justice, Courtesy and Love </i>is, as the subtitle 
            explains, an account of Christian missionaries during the last century 
            as they encountered religious life in parts of the world which Europeans 
            had only recently 'discovered'. In quite fascinating detail, Kenneth 
            Cracknell, himself a former missionary to western Africa, charts the 
            progress of missionary work to India, Africa and China in the 'great 
            century' from 1846 to 1914. 
            <p>This book is not about machete-swinging, perspiration-stained priests 
              cleaving their way through cannibal-infested jungles. Neither does 
              it tell a triumphal tale of how savages were 'saved for Jesus' (and 
              subsequently 'saved' for colonialism, exploitation and European 
              cultural values). <i>Justice, Courtesy and Love </i>describes<i> 
              </i>how missionaries were first intrigued, perturbed, confused and 
              then shocked to discover that those whom they had risked life and 
              limb to convert already had profound theological ideas of their 
              own. Kenneth Cracknell tells a tale of incremental changes to Christian 
              doctrine in order to accommodate the undeniable fact that God was 
              indeed working in mysterious ways - and not just in civilised Europe, 
              but entirely beyond the Judaeo-Christian world. 
            <p>His accounts of entrenched attitudes amongst the theologians of 
              the day, their wrangling and disputes, and the new doctrines which 
              gradually took shape as missionaries returned from foreign lands 
              explaining that Christ had been at work before they got there, makes 
              for fascinating reading. So too, does the appreciation which many 
              early missionaries had for the faiths they encountered. 
            <p>Naturally, as a devotee of Krishna, I was particularly drawn to 
              accounts of preaching in India. Whilst I have often heard tales 
              of myopic missionaries and their part in the domination of the sub-continent 
              by the British Raj, I had never heard of those who deeply appreciated 
              the godliness, serenity, saintly behaviour and self-sacrifice of 
              those whom they had come to convert. Successive waves of missionaries 
              wrote about the elevated doctrines they discovered: concepts such 
              as God's incarnations, contemplation and meditative states, scriptural 
              language and learning, along with magnificent temples and surrounding 
              priestly communities dedicated to the service of the Divine. All 
              of these things gave them food for thought, but also prompted much 
              discussion as to how God had wrought these religious ideas and behaviours 
              in the hearts and minds of men as yet untouched by both Old and 
              New Testaments.
            <p>Having been a member of a missionary organisation myself for more 
              than twenty years, I must admit to smiling in recognition as I read 
              of the constant disputation and search for higher meaning within 
              the body of Victorian theologians. ISKCON may not be perceived as 
              a mission by its own members, simply because most of us are preaching 
              in the country of our birth and not in strange and unfamiliar lands. 
              Yet because the nature of our movement is to preach Vaisnavism (and 
              to Vaisnavism, most would ascribe the term Hinduism), in predominantly 
              Christian countries, we are in fact, rather curiously, replicating 
              the efforts of those missionaries in reverse. Certain sociologists 
              have already remarked on the strange<i> karmic </i>arrangement of 
              modern-day Hindus preaching to Christians. 
            <p>What intrigues me is how much of the theological discussion that 
              went on within the early missionary community finds its parallel 
              in a modern 'mission' like ISKCON. Taking into account certain theological 
              verities defined in Vedic scripture, the same level of debate, argumentation 
              and reconciliation is again at work, this time amongst Europeans 
              who liberally use Sanskrit terminology instead of Latin or King 
              James' Biblical English. Unfortunately, as in the case of our Christian 
            brothers of the past, theological wrangling is often generated not 
            by the desire for genuine empathy and understanding, but out of a 
            desire to preserve one's cherished worldview at any cost. As a consequence 
            of such pride, even discussions of God Himself can descend into political 
            haranguing and splintering within the faith community. 
            <p>Kenneth Cracknell's book is thus an opportunity for us to learn 
              history, and thereby to not repeat it. It reveals that it is indeed 
              possible to love Christianity even more than Truth itself, and cautions 
              Christians not to resist change when such changes bring them nearer 
              to true understanding and practice. Vaisnavas can also heed this 
              caution. God does indeed live and speak within the hearts of others, 
              and a successful preacher is entreated to look beyond the external 
              differences of language, dress, architecture and culture to realise 
              this fact. 
            <p><i>Justice, Courtesy and Love</i> should also reveal to devotees 
              of Krishna that amongst the Christian community there have always 
              been, and always are, those who have deep and genuine respect for 
              Vaisnava <i>bhakti, </i>seeing it as non-different from their own 
              highest aspirations. Srila Prabhupada was always hopeful of the 
              message of Lord Caitanya being accepted by leaders of society, and 
              a reading of Kenneth Cracknell's book should prove to us that dialogue 
              with leading theologians, if undertaken with justice, courtesy and 
              love, will result in long lasting respect and understanding amongst 
              us all.

            <p><b>The Lost Art of Church Fund Raising<br>
              </b><strong>Publisher: Precept Press<br>
              Author: Ashley Hale</strong></p>
            <p>'A million dollars at the end of the rainbow.' I'm a believer in 
              <i>sadhana</i><i> bhakti.</i> How about you? What I mean is that 
              if you find a pure devotee and follow his instructions carefully 
              to the letter, you are guaranteed success in devotional service. 
              And if you read <i>The Lost Art of Church Fund Raising</i> by Ashley 
              Hale and follow his instructions, you will find that pot of gold 
              at the end of the rainbow. It's a complete 'How To' on capital fundraising, 
              and it works.</p>
            With four decades experience in professional fundraising Ashley Hale 
            has given us excellent guidelines to achieve excellence in our fundraising. 
            In twelve point type on four by nine inch pages with plenty of white 
            space, <i>The Lost Art </i>is an easy read. Its forty-seven chapters 
            of three pages each cover everything from 'are we ready for fundraising?' 
            to 'sixteen ways to increase giving', 'the Minister's role' and 'the 
            eleven cardinal points'. 
            <p>I especially appreciated Hale's emphasis on empowering the congregation 
              to do the asking, keeping the priest as a spiritually detached adviser. 
              The chapter headed 'Planning that works' should be required reading 
              for every ISKCON leader considering a capital fundraising campaign. 
              Hale also takes the reader step-by-step through the fundraising 
              process, beginning with searching for congregational leaders who 
              can spearhead the campaign, to seeking donor prospects. There's 
              even a section on the difference between excuses for not giving 
              and reasons for not giving, and how to react to both. This book 
              is both philosophically sound and practically useful.
