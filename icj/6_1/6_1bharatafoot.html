                of the Hare Krishna Movement, was forced to suspend publication 
                for financial reasons in 1989-91 as members withdrew their support 
                to the institution. <br>

              <li><a name="3"></a>The Guru reform movement was led by members 
                within the movement towards improving the effectiveness of the 
                management structure of ISKCON. It was, furthermore, a reassessment 
                of the perception of spiritual authority and who was qualified 
                to initiate disciples in the movement. This took place between 
                1986-87. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="4"></a>A third aspect was often cited as a criticism, 
                this was the lack of speed to address the problem by victims and 
                parents. However, to the victim and his or her family, no response 
                will be fast enough, we can only try and put this into perspective 
                by comparing ISKCON's response to other religious organisations.

              <li><a name="6"></a>It is possible to see this response as a defiance

                which is a breakdown of communications brought about by the disruption 
                of regional authority during the Guru Reform Movement. <br>

              <li><a name="14"></a>Resolutions 98-305 are not without critics. 
                Some devotee professionals in the field note issues that are not 
                addressed or are incompletely addressed: <br>
                1. Loop holes that can be used by abusers who have 'friends in 
                high places.' <br>
                2. Programme administrators are already overworked <br>
                3. Investigators and judges are non-professionals. <br>
                4. The Appeal Procedure puts final decisions in the hands of people 
                who may or may not be qualified to pass final judgement. <br>
                5. Centralised authority for Child Protection Office lacks assurances 
                that regional offices will be capable of compliance. <br>
                6. Local devotee investigators very likely will know parties involved, 
                creating conflict of interest.<br>
                7. Psychological evaluations are far less reliable than the creators 
                of 98-305 indicate. <br>
                8. Screening programme is inadequate. <br>
                9. Some procedures may violate ethical and legal codes in some 
                areas. (Source: gleaned from private correspondence/discussion 
                with several professional colleagues.) Resolutions 98-305 as a 
                new initiative undoubtedly will need modification. However, early 
                indications are that the CPO has the full cooperation of devotees 
                who have exemplary moral and spiritual practice as well as professional 
                competency in the areas of child protection and family counselling 
                and education. Therefore, it seems likely that the CPO and the 
                GBC will address these criticisms responsibly. <br>
