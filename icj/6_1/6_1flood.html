            <p align=LEFT><b>Author: Gavin Flood<br>
              Publisher: Cambridge University Press</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>If you are looking for a general reference book on Hinduism 
              this book may be a useful starting point. Gavin Flood has written 
              a book that is a helpful aid to the beginner student of Hinduism 
              or the general reader who wants to gain a deeper insight into the 
              cultures and traditions of India's majority religion. It comprehensively 
              details the main concepts of Hinduism, explaining them clearly and 
              concisely. 
            <p>I found this book particularly useful in understanding the many 
              different roots and influences on Hinduism, how different traditions 
              began, and are influenced and changed by parallel traditions and 
              cultures. The continually developing nature of the Hindu traditions 
              was fascinating; for example, the information on how South Indian 
              Tamil culture developed rich artistic traditions independently of 
              the North Indian Sanskritic bhraminical culture was very interesting. 
              This was no more apparent than in Tamil literarature. Early Caikam 
              literature has a strong tradition of emotional expression; this 
              allowed for a whole-hearted adoption of <i>bhakti</i> (devotion 
              to a deity) when it was brought to the south, and the development 
              of <i>bhakti</i> traditions in the south went on to significantly 
              influence northern Hindu culture in the future. Examples such as 
              these enabled me to comprehend the dynamics of the development of 
              such a multifaceted religion. In fact, this book is a good general 
              starting point for anyone desiring to understand the origins and 
              development of the Vaishnava traditions and the various different 
              schools of thought. As a Vaishnava it helped me understand where 
              Gaudiya Vaishnavism fits into the larger picture of the Vaishnava 
              Tradition, as well as helping me get an idea of the teachings of 
              the two other major strands within Hinduism: Shaivism and Shaktism. 
            <p>I found the final section on Hinduism in modern times the most 
              useful in gaining an understanding of how Hinduism has developed 
              during, and since the British Raj in India. This section was indispensable 
              in succinctly outlining the more recent political changes and influences 
              in Hinduism. This is achieved by an examination of the key figures 
              that have made an impact on the face of the culture. The lives and 
              teachings of religious leaders and the organisations which they 
              founded such as Ram Mohan Roy, founder of the Bhramo Samaj, Dayananda 
              Sarasvati and the Arya Samaj, Rama Krishna and Vivekananda and the 
              Vedanta Society, as well as Mahatma Gandhi's enormous influence. 
              A brief account is given of their life stories and the development 
              of their philosophies, together with the influence they had in forming 
              Hindu self-identity in India and how the perceptions of westerners 
              of Hinduism was changed by them. 
            <p>This introductory survey of Hinduism is presented from a historical 
              context. It allows the general reader to understand certain values 
              and beliefs in an applied context. Gavin Flood explains how <i>dharma</i> 
              is one of the key aspects in the role of Hindu kingship. He explains 
              usefully how <i>dharma</i> dictates the rites and duties of kings-governing 
              the status and behaviour of kings in political as well as domestic 
              affairs which includes social relationships with his subjects and 
              peers. Although he was more important in the capacity as a ritual 
              figure in close proximity to the Divine, he was not an autocratic 
              ruler as his function was also an integrated part within the whole 
              kingdom, and this in turn encapsulated all within it, right down 
              to his relationship with the villager. 
            <p><i>An Introduction to Hinduism</i> is also useful for general facts 
              and figures about Hinduism and alerting the reader to areas of contemporary 
              debate in the study of Hinduism. Gavin Flood offers sensitive and 
              considered discussions which can draw the reader to further reading. 
              A good general introductory book.
