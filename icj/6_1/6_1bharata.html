            <p align=LEFT>In his article in this issue, Professor Burke Rochford 

              has outlined the sociological factors that led ISKCON away from 

              any concern for healthy family life and into an era in which children, 

              especially, were marginalised. He explores some of the agonising 

              consequences of this marginalisation. The sad reality was that schools 

              and other child-centred environments were often managed by untrained 

              people, often lacking even rudimentary parenting skills. Unfortunately 

              ISKCON also attracted some child predators because it was a young 

              movement lacking in organisational strength at grass roots levels, 

              with few of the controls that a more established, experienced organisation 

              might have in place in order to protect its children. Professor 

              Rochrford analyses some of the darkest aspects of the history of 

              our institution, taking us up to the situation as it was in 1986. 

              This paper looks at some of the more recent events and trends which 

              have taken place since ISKCON as a society became aware of the tragic 

              consequences of assuming that young, untrained, devotee leaders 

              would be capable of creating an ideal environment for raising balanced 

              and healthy, spiritually directed children.

            <p align=LEFT><b>Recent developments<br>
              </b>As the 1980s drew to a close, the problem of child abuse developed 
              into an unavoidable issue that the ISKCON Governing Body Commission 
              (GBC) would have to address. ISKCON's momentum had stalled. An ageing 
              membership, bereft of its adored leader Shrila Prabhupada, drifted 
              away from the authority of the 'renunciate elite'.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#1"> 
              1</a> Many married and settled down, returning to school or entering 
              into business ventures or regular employment. Although many continued 
              to follow the instructions of the Founder-Acarya, Shrila Prabhupada, 
              at the same time some no longer considered themselves part of ISKCON.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#2">2</a> 
              Confidence in ISKCON leadership was at an all-time low. The ISKCON 
              leadership, plagued by scandals and political in-fighting, with 
              power seriously eroded by the Guru Reform movement, lacked a unifying 
              vision.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#3">3</a> Material ignorance, 
              inexperience, widespread deviation from the teachings of Shrila 
              Prabhupada (half the original GBC members withdrew or were expelled 
              from their leadership posts), and lack of confidence in their own 
              ability to carry forward Shrila Prabhupada's movement, rendered 
              the GBC ineffective. Powerless to respond to the accusations of 
              corruption, philosophical deviation, politically motivated cover-ups, 
              and charges of child abuse reaching to top levels, the GBC was faced 
              with either addressing the child abuse problem head-on or watching 
              what little authority they retained vanish. If ISKCON was to survive 
              as a coherent organisation, the GBC had to respond intelligently 
              and decisively to the accusations of child abuse. <a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#4">4</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>In 1990 at the annual GBC meetings held in Mayapur, 

              India, Resolution 119 was passed. This Resolution reads as follows:

            <p>That the following is adopted as the official ISKCON policy on 

              child abuse incidents: 

            <ol type="1">

              <li>The local governing authority of each ISKCON school or community 

                is responsible to appoint 2 or 3 devotees to investigate and follow-up 

                on all suspected or confirmed cases of child abuse.</li>

              <li>Suspected or confirmed cases of child abuse must be reported 

                to local government authorities for investigation and/or prosecution. 

                In India, the ISKCON International Office of Education may authorise 

                a waiver of this requirement if the perpetrator is willing to 

                sign a statement authorising the International Office of Education 

                to publicise the incident to all ISKCON-related educational projects 

                and other concerned parties. </li>

              <li>All suspected or confirmed incidents of child abuse must be 

                reported immediately to the local GBC secretary, and, within thirty 

                days, to the ISKCON International Office of Education. The ISKCON 

                International Office of Education shall review the investigation 

                and give a finding as to the status of the alleged perpetrator 

                as confirmed, suspect, or innocent/not-suspected. </li>

              <li>The perpetrator or alleged perpetrator must be immediately segregated 

                so that he has no possible contact with the victim or other children. 

                This segregation may take the form of relocating the perpetrator 

                to another part of the project, away from children; banishment 

                from the project (and possibly from other ISKCON projects with 

                children); or in severe cases, banishment from all ISKCON projects. 

                The degree of segregation will be determined by the nature and 

                severity of the offence; the attitude of the perpetrator; the 

                feasibility of protecting the children from further abuse or intimidation; 

                and the sentiments of the local devotees, especially the parents. 

                <br>

                In no case should a confirmed or suspected perpetrator remain 

                in the local community unless the local ISKCON authorities obtain 

                the written authorisation of no less than 3/4 of the parents of 

                children at the project or in the community. The local government 

                authorities and/or the ISKCON Board of Education will make the 

                final determination of the appropriate degree of segregation. 

              </li>

              <li>Any confirmed child abuser may never again serve in association 

                with children in any ISKCON project. The Board will also make 

                available to all ISKCON educational projects and temples the names 

                of all accused, admitted, confirmed or convicted child abusers. 

              </li>

              <li>Abused children must get appropriate professional counselling 

                so that the serious ill effects of the abuse can be minimised. 

              </li>

              <li>All ISKCON educational projects must have preventative programs 

                which train children how to avoid and report child abuse incidents. 

              </li>

              <li>The local GBC man (or men) are directly responsible to implement 

                the measures outlined above. Should the GBC Body find a GBC man 

                or other ISKCON manager responsible for suppressing or covering-up 

                complaints of child abuse, or supporting intimidation of those 

                who might complain, the GBC man shall be open to censure or probation, 

                and the ISKCON manager shall be open to appropriate disciplinary 

                action.</li>

            </ol>

            <p>This Resolution, with its carefully considered and worded provisions, 

              is clearly aimed at rectifying future allegations of abuse. But, 

              as Maria Ekstrand, a Psychology professor at San Francisco University 

              and an initiated devotee (Madhusudani-Radha devi dasi) points out, 

              there are no means of enforcement built into the resolution, and 

              in addition, there are no provisions for addressing past abuses 

              (1997). Nevertheless, it was a start. Resolutions 90-119 establish 

              that: 

            <ol type="a">

              <li>The GBC recognises that there are inevitable cases of abuse 

                within the ISKCON community.</li>

              <li>The GBC has a moral obligation to address allegations of such 

                abuse. </li>

              <li>Responsibility for prevention, investigation and prosecution 
                rests with the local ISKCON authorities, not with the GBC or any 
                other central authority.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#5">5</a></li>

            </ol>

            <p> Given the eroded authority of the GBC, there was no way in practical 
              terms for the GBC to enforce its guidelines. Although worded as 
              Law, Resolutions 90-119 carries the force of recommendation to local 
              authorities, who in many cases had never even read the Resolution, 
              much less followed its suggestions.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#6">6</a> 
              It is not so difficult to understand how local authorities, managers 
              of once opulent temples and preaching centres but now managers of 
              decrepit relics, under-funded and under-staffed, with little cooperation, 
              but a great deal of criticism from the disorganised and disenchanted 
              householder community, might find a new rule, well intended as it 
              might have been, simply too much to deal with at that time. Even 
              if a temple authority desired to comply, they encountered enormous 
              obstacles as hardly any devotees now lived under the roof of an 
              ISKCON building. Nevertheless, the problem had been faced -at least; 
              there were now some guidelines. 
            <p>However as time passed it became clear that more needed to be done. 
              Six years would pass before there was sufficient groundswell of 
              support for additional measures. In the meantime, it would appear 
              that the GBC felt that they had dealt with the problem of abuse. 
              There was reason for them to believe so. For instance, in the early 
              1990s there were two cases of abuse in the Chicago area. The temple 
              president followed the guidelines in Resolutions 90-119 very carefully, 
              thus protecting the Chicago centre from liability, encouraging a 
              prompt and thorough investigation by local authorities, and protecting 
              the children from possible further abuse. The suspects were removed 
              from their ISKCON positions and eventually prosecuted and convicted 
              by local authorities.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#7"> 7</a> With 
              increasing regularity, ISKCON authorities found that when such a 
              serious matter as child abuse came up in their sphere of responsibilities, 
              the Resolutions 90-119 guidelines gave them the tools they needed 
              to handle the situation surely and swiftly, with regard to the rights 
              of both the victims and the accused. ISKCON schools formed Child 
              Protection Teams (CPTs) when their communities were hit with allegations 
              of abuse, and a few of those committees remained as standing committees, 
              as required under Resolutions 90-119. Most (but not all) ISKCON 
              schools formed CPTs. It seemed that the problem was solved, or could 
              be if everyone followed the recommendations of Resolutions 90-119. 
              Or was it? In reality, all Resolutions 90-119 does is guide a community 
              through the process for removing and investigating a case of alleged 
              abuse. However the provisions of Resolutions 90-119 <i>do not </i>address 
              the issue of prevention (other than saying that it should exist 
              <a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#8">8</a>), and the guidelines it does 
              present carry no force of law. They were effectively unenforceable. 
              In addition, Resolutions 90-119 does precious little to address 
              the problem of what to do with the victims. Some progress had been 
              made to be sure. The guidelines were working to some extent, and 
              as time went on compliance increased as local communities heard 
              how useful it had been to the communities which had had to face 
              a case of child abuse in their midst. But the issues of prevention 
              and victim rehabilitation were crying out to be addressed, and nothing 
              more was happening. 
            <p>An increased impetus for change came in May 1996, at the North 
              American GBC meeting in Alachua, Florida. Here a group of former 
              <i>gurukula</i><a

 href="6_1bharatafoot.html#9">9</a> pupils, invited to speak by the leadership, 
              detailed case after case of heart wrenching suffering at the hands 
              of school authorities which reduced the entire audience of educators 
              to tears.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#10">10</a> Virtually every 
              former student (these included those who had attended schools over 
              the last twenty years) at the conference was either a witness or 
              a victim. Children suffered denial of medical care for life-threatening 
              illnesses, serious bruises and contusions, lost teeth, broken noses, 
              scarring from caning, repeated sexual abuse and even homosexual 
              rape at knifepoint. The perpetrators of these very serious crimes 
              were none other than the teachers, the <i>ashram</i> leaders, the 
              administrators, and in some cases even <i>sannyasis</i> and ISKCON 
              <i>gurus.</i><a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#11">11</a> The leadership 
              of ISKCON, particularly the GBC, simply had to address the issue 
              of past abuses or face a crippling credibility crisis. In fact, 
              the whole of ISKCON had to do something. An entire generation of 
              children had been subjected to horrendous treatment at the hands 
              of those entrusted with their welfare by parents who thought that 
              they were doing what was best for their children. The children, 
              now adults, had complained before and no one had listened. But, 
              their voice had now been heard collectively, and their parents' 
              generation began to initiate measures on its own instead of demanding 
              that the GBC take action. In addition, the children, now young adults, 
              some of whom had been victims, organised themselves. 
            <p>The first 'grass roots' organisation formed was the Children of 

              Krishna. This group was formed during the May 1996 meetings of the 

              North American GBC and was a spontaneous response by participants 

              of the meeting. Children of Krishna are composed of both first and 

              second generation devotees. The mission of the Children of Krishna 

              is: 'To support, further, and protect the education, economic, emotional, 

              and spiritual advancement of the children of the Hare Krishna Movement.' 

              They are principally a grant-dispensing organisation that has helped 

              young devotees finance college and other post-secondary training, 

              and they have helped fund therapy for victims of abuse. 

            <p>A small group of second generation adults formed a World Wide Web 
              news site, called <i>VOICE.</i><a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#12">12</a> 
              While <i>VOICE</i> clearly colours its postings understandably with 
              cynical bitterness, they were probably the single most important 
              vehicle for translating the 1996 North American GBC meeting experience 
              into a global revelation and a global problem for ISKCON. Case after 
              case of reliable testimony transformed child abuse from a 'local' 
              or 'isolated' problem into an issue which had to be dealt with by 
              each and every member of the devotee community, regardless of which 
              generation they belonged to or whether they had, or had not been 
              a victim of abuse. Although one still could hear the GBC and the 
              gurus being blamed for all the ills of the Society, one also heard 
              a lot of mature devotees expressing personal responsibility. In 
              other words, the mood changed from 'They [meaning ISKCON authorities] 
              ought to do something' to 'We [meaning local communities and parents] 
              ought to do something.' 
            <p>Less than a year after the May 1996 testimonies, the GBC had enacted 
              a proposal put forward by the ISKCON Communications team in Europe 
              which proposed that a Task Force be created to deal not only with 
              future cases of abuse, as Resolutions 90-119 outlined, but also 
              to address past cases. This became the GBC Task Force. That Task 
              Force presented its findings at the annual Mayapur GBC meetings 
              in early 1998. GBC Resolutions 98-305 enacted the recommendations 
              of that report as ISKCON policy. <a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#13">13</a> 
              The new Child Protection Policy outlines acceptable standards of 
              behaviour for those in contact with children, sets up a review panel 
              to investigate and, if necessary, reopen past cases, sets up a tribunal 
              court system to hear cases, creates a permanent Child Protection 
              Office, and, perhaps most importantly, <i>funds </i> the office, 
              the judges, and at least partial costs of victim rehabilitative 
              therapy.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#14">14</a> 
            <p><b>Where does ISKCON stand?<br>
              </b>Dharmaraj dasa a second generation devotee based in Sweden, 
              who is also a member of the GBC Task Force, is now coordinating 
              the Child Protection programme in Europe. In his opinion, abuse 
              seems to be very nearly under control in the schools.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#15">15</a> 
              In the last year, two high profile cases have come to light and 
              which have been handled decisively. The first case concerns a man 
              who was Head of a school in India for 15 years; he was a <i>sannyasi</i> 
              and initiating ISKCON <i>guru.</i> The result of an internal investigation 
              meant that he was stripped of his authority, censured and banned 
              from ISKCON communities. Another case concerned the Head of a school 
              in the USA who had, ironically, become a Director of Child Protection 
              and was also authorised to accept disciples (although he had never 
              done so). This case resulted in having him removed from all offices 
              and barred from ISKCON communities while the investigation continues. 
              Although it would be impossible to state with certainty that child 
              abuse has been rooted out of all of ISKCON's schools, the general 
              impression is that the schools are far safer than they once were, 
              and that when cases do surface, they are handled sensibly, compassionately, 
              and legally. <a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#16">16</a> 
            <p>On the other hand, few communities have a CPT. Few have even an 
              awareness of practical prevention measures. Compliance with the 
              provisions of Resolutions 90-119 (7) has been very poor. Part of 
              this poor performance may indeed, as ISKCON's internal critics like 
              to point out, be due to a residual 'renunciate elite' attitude which 
              relegates child abuse to the minor category of 'householder problem'.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#17">17</a> 
            <p>Another, more probable, cause is the ineffective but pervasive 

              management strategy of addressing all problems when, and only when, 

              they become emergencies. High level authorities are more like firemen 

              than managers: all they do is 'put out fires'. Thus any sort of 

              prevention programme remains unstudied and unimplemented while the 

              authorities rush about controlling crises which might have been 

              preventable had prevention programmes been enacted. It is not until 

              a community is hit with a high profile abuse case that they invest 

              energy into prevention programs, such as a sitting CPT. Fortunately, 

              modern communications, such as the Internet, are having a positive 

              effect in this area. Since bad news travels swiftly (almost instantaneously 

              on the Internet), members of communities can grasp the magnitude 

              of the abuse problem and ring the 'alarm bells' before the 'fire' 

              hits their communities.

            <p>A third possible reason for poor compliance is, regrettably and 

              paradoxically, poor communication. Despite the Internet, mass mailings 

              and word of mouth, for some reason rank-and-file devotees, especially 

              in areas outside North America and Western Europe, simply remain 

              unaware of the scope of the problem of abuse, or obtain their information 

              from questionable sources, which puts them in the position of either 

              acting on unreliable information or disbelieving information which 

              is accurate. These are all management issues, and they affect not 

              only the Child Abuse programmes, but also all aspects of ISKCON's 

              operations. The GBC and other authorities are well aware of the 

              magnitude of the problem. Considerable resources have been dedicated 

              to solving this problem, from management seminars to web sites to 

              the international Bhaktivedanta Book Trust bulletin board known 

              as COM.

            <p>As channels of communication improve, one would suppose that compliance 

              with GBC Resolutions 119 and 305 would also improve. At least local 

              people will be more readily aware of resources, should they resolve 

              to address the problem locally. Additionally, materials on Child 

              Abuse have been developed and are distributed widely. Among these 

              are:

            <ul type="DISC">

              <li><i>Help save our future</i> (small pamphlet of facts on child 

                abuse prevention) </li>

              <li><i>A guide on interviewing children</i> (compiled by Yasoda 

                devi dasi, a professional in the field) </li>

              <li><i>Normal Sexual Development of Children</i></li>

              <li><i>Preventing Child Abuse in ISKCON</i> (An in-depth manual 

                on Child Abuse Prevention published by the ISKCON Board of Education). 

              </li>

              <li><i>A guide to screening</i> (a short, easy-to-use manual on 

                screening prospective school staff). </li>

            </ul>

            <p><b>What does the future hold? <br>

              </b>Although any prognostications are speculative, there are two 

              areas in which I think that we can make reasonably accurate predictions. 

              One area is the scope of the problem and the other is a prognosis 

              for ISKCON's ability to address the problem satisfactorily. The 

              latter is more easily dealt with, as GBC Resolutions 90-119 and 

              98-305 set policy, outline procedures, set up an international office 

              to disseminate information, conduct screening, keep records, collect 

              statistics, conduct investigations (especially in areas of the world 

              where civil authorities lack competence), and provide at least some 

              measure of policing. One would hope that such endeavour, complete 

              with provisions for funding and follow up (98-305 mandates this), 

              would bode well for ISKCON's ability to redress past abuses and 

              develop effective prevention programmes. Over the next few years 

              the Child Protection Office will collect enough data so that we 

              can have the statistical evidence needed to evaluate and adjust 

              the effectiveness of the new policies.

            <p>The other area, the scope of the problem, is far more speculative. 

              I have looked at other organisations, especially the Boy Scouts 

              of America, to see if ISKCON is unusual in the breadth and scope 

              of the abuse problem. The short answer is that it is not. However, 

              in what could be seen as a case of hubris brought on by humility, 

              ISKCON devotees seem to have firm faith that their leaders are more 

              incompetent, more prone to 'fall-down' than other religious groups, 

              and that ISKCON's miscreants are worse than those in the larger 

              society, believing that simply because they have spiritual knowledge 

              they should be better able to carry out any role of management or 

              leadership. My research into this premise highlights that this is 

              quite a naive outlook.

            <p>While accepting that child abuse is wrong and should be eliminated 

              from our society, we must place our problems in a broader context 

              by comparing ourselves to other institutions and seeing things in 

              a historical context. Abuse has been around a long time. In historical 

              times, Dante relegates the unjustly condemned Count Ugolino to the 

              ice of the lowest level of Hell in his thirteenth Century masterpiece, 

              <i>Comedia,</i> because he abused his child. In later times, the 

              children in Dickens's tales are almost universally abused: Oliver 

              Twist is literally starved by the Church-run orphanage and Pip is 

              brutally beaten by his father, who as a blacksmith must have had 

              very powerful arms. Even in our scriptures we find abuse was going 

              on-King Kamsa physically abused children, as did Hiranyakashipu. 

              Whether in ancient India, medieval Italy or modern England, the 

              perpetrators of abuse are condemned and their actions vilified. 

              However, the Information Age brings every heinous act into our collective 

              living rooms all at once, giving the impression that the problem 

              is much larger than it used to be. 

            <p>What <i>has</i> changed is consciousness-how we perceive and react 
              to the issue. What used to be considered a regrettable and pitiable 
              part of some children's lives, now is considered a crime against 
              every child and the whole of society. The role of childhood in the 
              life of an adult has changed dramatically since Freud. So many social 
              aberrations can be traced back to a childhood trauma, and the role 
              of childhood experience has become vastly more important in the 
              last half-century. There is no doubt that child abuse has resulted 
              in lasting psychological trauma in many adults. What has changed, 
              however, is the awareness that abuse is pervasive in most societies 
              on the planet today, and the results of that abuse not only have 
              permanent effects on the victims, but also transcend generations 
              as the abused become the next generation of abusers.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#18">18</a> 
            <p>As the public became more aware of the all-pervasiveness of child 
              abuse, they demanded accountability. Although statistically most 
              abuse occurs within a child's family circle,<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#19">19</a> 
              organisations that engage children, particularly those making a 
              claim to providing moral and religious guidance, have increasingly 
              come under attack for harbouring child abusers. There are two principle 
              reasons for this: one is that these kinds of organisations use volunteers 
              (who are therefore more 'noble' than mere employees); the other 
              is that these organisations claim to foster moral and religious 
              character superior to the child's family or the society as a whole. 
              Thus, child abuse in such a context is regarded as far worse precisely 
              because the perpetrators were trusted to be the moral guides of 
              the children. These groups include no less than the Roman Catholic 
              Church and the Boy Scouts of America. 
            <p>At the same time that ISKCON was discovering that it had an abuse 
              problem, the Boy Scouts were finding out the same thing.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#20">20</a> 
              In late 1988 a lawsuit in Reston, Virginia brought by a man claiming 
              to be an abused former Scout revealed that Boy Scout records indicated 
              that over 200 scout leaders had been dismissed over the past twenty 
              years for abuse. The Washington Times commissioned an investigation 
              team that looked into the matter more deeply. When the story broke 
              in 1991, it established that 1871 leaders had been dismissed throughout 
              the country over twenty years. Everyone was shocked, not least the 
              Boy Scouts, who had not kept a database of this information. The 
              press naturally reported the Boy Scout files as 'secret', which 
              implies a conspiracy to cover up, when actually they are 'not public' 
              and therefore no statistics had been tabulated. In other words, 
              no one had noticed how many Scout leaders were abusers until someone 
              pointed it out, even though the records were all there in the files. 
              Each embarrassing case had been quietly 'resolved' without a collective 
              awareness of the breadth and magnitude of the problem. 
            <p>A reporter for the <i>Washington Times</i>, Patrick Boyle, wrote 
              a book about it that went on sale about the same time as the wire 
              services picked up the story.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#21">21</a> 
              Curiously, the <i>Times</i> story had not been hot news. The Associated 
              Press and major newspapers did not run the story until October 1993, 
              18 months after the <i>Times</i> story. In 1991, the major press 
              did not sense that the public would be particularly interested in 
              a story about abusive Boy Scout leaders, but in 1993, it was <i>News</i>! 
              The Boy Scouts were faced with a huge public relations nightmare, 
              not to mention a moral crisis. Fortunately, in 1990 <a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#22"> 
              22</a> the top leaders of the Boy Scouts had sensed as they prepared 
              for the Reston case and others that abuse was a major problem in 
              its ranks, and had begun developing a Youth Protection Programme. 
              This Youth Protection Programme had five parts: 
            <ul type="DISC">

              <li>Educate Scouting volunteers, parents and Scouts themselves to 

                aid in the detection and prevention of child abuse. </li>

              <li> Establish leader-selection procedures to prevent offenders 

                from entering the BSA leadership ranks. </li>

              <li>Establish policies that create barriers to child abuse within 

                the programme. <br>

                Encourage Scouts to report improper behaviour in order to identify 

                offenders quickly. </li>

              <li>Remove and report alleged offenders swiftly. </li>

            </ul>

            <p>This programme soon revealed another 400 cases, but since then 
              the number of incidents has slowed to a trickle and the Boy Scouts 
              are heralded for their Youth Protection Programme. In fact, elements 
              of the ISKCON programme appear to be similar to theirs.<a href="6_1bharatafoot.html#23">23</a> 
              If the Boy Scouts story turns out to be similar to the ISKCON story 
              yet to unfold, devotees can take heart in the facts that while ISKCON 
              reels from high profile cases, bitter criticism from the victims 
              and their advocates, and a perception that ISKCON is thoroughly 
              infiltrated with perverts and bullies, the reality is that steps 
              already taken have encouraged victims to face their abusers and 
              enabled communities to respond intelligently, compassionately and 
              justly to local situations. While much more work needs to be done, 
              both at global and local levels, ISKCON has taken significant measures 
              that closely resemble those which are beginning to produce measurable 
              results in at least one other similar organisation.

                      David Gordon White demonstrates for the first time that 

                      the medieval disciplines of Hindu alchemy and hatha-yoga 

                      were practised by the same people, and that they can only 

                      be understood when viewed together.&nbsp; White opens the 

                      way to a new and more comprehensive understanding of medieval 

                      Indian mysticism, within the broader context of South Asian 

                      Hinduism, Jainism and Islam.

                    <p>This book offers useful insights into the complex and internally 

                      diverse realm of Hinduism. It is intended to acquaint the 

                      reader with themes and issues that, while of relevance to 

                      all religious traditions and systems, contribute to an understanding 

                      of the abstract nature of Hinduism as a whole. Beginning 

                      with Hindu religious understandings of the human condition, 

                      the chapters are arranged so as to form a thematic survey 

                      and overview of Hindu religious beliefs and practices. The 

                      themes of morality and ethics, the role of women in Hinduism, 

                      the Hindu religious construction of nature, and issues such 

                      as mythology, the status of texts, forms of worship, and 

                      sacred time and place can be systematically considered; 

                      or, alternatively, focus can fall upon those topics that 

                      are of particular personal interest. Readers should find 

                      this book a wide-ranging and balanced introduction to Hinduism's 

                      inner diversity.</p>

                    <p>What is one to make of a group of goddesses that includes 

                      a goddess who cuts her own head off, a goddess who sits 

                      on a corpse while pulling the tongue of a demon, or a goddess 

                      who prefers sex with corpses? Tantric Visions of the Divine 

                      Feminine deals with a group of ten Hindu Mahavidyas, who 

                      embody habits, attributes or identities usually considered 

                      repulsive or socially subversive.&nbsp; It is within the 

                      context of tantric worship that devotees seek to identify 

                      themselves with these forbidding goddesses.&nbsp; The Mahavidyas 

                      seem to function as 'awakeners' - symbols that help to project 

                      one's consciousness beyond the socially acceptable or predictable. 

                    <p>Kinsley not only describes the eccentric qualities of each 

                      of these goddesses but seeks to interpret the Mahavidyas 

                      as a group and to explain their importance for understanding 

                      Tantra and the Hindu tradition.

                    <p>No religion ever remains static: it affects and is in turn 

                      affected by material reality.&nbsp; It is the creative tension 

                      embodied in this dynamic which makes the world of religion, 

                      rich with possibilities. 

                    <p>This book examines the contours of this creative tension 

                      in the context of Hinduism in our own times. For Hinduism, 

                      a religion of unknown antiquity is also, in several ways, 

                      surprisingly modern. Hinduism for Our Times is an attempt 

                      to raise this dimension of Hinduism to an unprecedented 

                      level of self-awareness.&nbsp; Thus the choices that Hindus 

                      must make in the context of modernisation and globalisation 

                      become conscious as opposed to random choices, choices which 

                      will place Hinduism at the cutting edge of the contemporary 

                      world instead of consigning it to the periphery.&nbsp; This 

                      book will appeal to all those interested in giving religion 

                      a modern agenda.
