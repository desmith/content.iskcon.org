 align=LEFT>Religion and child abuse, ' &quot;perfect together&quot; . . .and 
              mutually attractive.' So concludes Donald Capps in his 1992 presidential 
              address to members of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. 
              Mutually attractive in spite of the fact that religion has often 
              vigorously defended the rights of children, including condemning 
              child abuse and neglect (Capps 1992; Costin et al. 1996:47). Yet 
              research on child abuse suggests that religious beliefs can foster, 
              encourage, and justify the abuse of children (Capps 1992; Ellison 
              and Sherkat 1993; Greven 1990; Jenkins 1996). Moreover, church structures 
              may provide opportunities for abusive clergy (Krebs 1998; Shupe 
              1995). 
            <p align=LEFT>This paper deals with how children in a religious organisation 
              were abused physically, psychologically and sexually by people responsible 
              for their care and well being. My purpose is to describe the problem 
              as it existed within the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              (ISKCON), more popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. This 
              discussion of child abuse within ISKCON is a historical one.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              I consider child abuse and neglect within the context of ISKCON's 
              boarding schools-or <i> ashram</i>-based gurukulas- as they existed 
              from 1972 until the mid-1980s. I develop a sociologically informed 
              framework to understand how and why child abuse and neglect took 
              place. Thus my attempt is not concerned with identifying or explaining 
              the 'causes' of child abuse by focusing on the abuser per se. Rather 
              attention is given to a variety of organisational factors that fostered, 
              and indeed created opportunities for child abuse to occur within 
              ISKCON's schools. 
            <p align=LEFT>I argue that child abuse must be understood within the 
              broader context of ISKCON's development as a religious organisation. 
              The expansion of marriage and family life has defined ISKCON's transition 
              from a communally-organised sectarian movement, to one characterised 
              by a loosely organised congregation of financially independent householders 
              and their children (Rochford 1995a, 1995b, 1997). As the number 
              of marriages and children began to grow in the mid-1970s, householder 
              life was redefined by ISKCON's renunciate elite as a symbol of spiritual 
              weakness. As a stigmatised and politically marginal group, householders 
              were left powerless to assert their parental authority over the 
              lives of their children. Children were abused in part because they 
              were not valued by leaders, and even, very often, by their own parents 
              who accepted theological and other justifications offered by the 
              leadership for remaining uninvolved in the lives of their children. 
            <p align=LEFT>In recent years, child abuse has played an influential 
              role in the ongoing politic surrounding the authority and legitimacy 
              of ISKCON's leadership. For many ISKCON members, and devotees marginal 
              to or outside of the organisation, child abuse stands as a powerful 
              symbol of the failure of ISKCON's traditionalist, communal, hierarchical 
              (that is, sectarian) form of social organisation. Child abuse has 
              come to represent a fundamental betrayal of trust, not only for 
              abused children and their parents but also for the membership more 
              generally. (Also, see Rochford 1998a on leader misconduct and changing 
              sources of religious authority within ISKCON.) 
            <p align=LEFT>It is important to make clear from the start that no 
              one knows how many of ISKCON's children were abused in the <i>gurukula.</i> 
              It is also the case that ISKCON's <i>gurukulas</i> did not uniformly 
              experience problems of child abuse. Finally, the virtual collapse 
              of these institutions in North America and world-wide in favour 
              of community day-schools, has all but eliminated the context of 
              abuse considered here.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#3">3</a> 
            <p align=LEFT> Before turning to the substantive issues raised above, 
              I first want to build a broader context for my discussion. One only 
              has to pick up the local newspaper to realise that child abuse occurs 
              all too frequently in the communities in which we live. Moreover, 
              while we might assume that religious life would remain immune to 
              the tragedy of child abuse, the facts suggest otherwise. Various 
              religious groups-conventional and unconventional alike-have been 
              shaken by allegations of child abuse, especially sexual misconduct 
              on the part of church authorities (Jenkins 1996:50-52; Palmer 1997; 
              Shupe 1995, 1998). 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Defining the problem of child abuse<br>
              </b>Reported cases of child abuse and neglect have been on the rise 
              in the USA in recent years (Costin et al., 1996:136-7; Daro 1988).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#4">4</a> 
              More than a million young people suffer abuse and mistreatment annually 
              (Daro 1988:13; US Bureau of the Census 1997:218). The American Association 
              for Protecting Children found that 1.7 million children suffered 
              neglect or abuse in 1984, an increase of 156% since 1976, the first 
              year this agency began collecting data on child abuse (Daro 1988:13).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#5"> 
              5</a> In 1995, there were just under two million reported cases 
              of child abuse involving 2.95 million children in the United States. 
              After investigation by State child protective services, evidence 
              suggests that 1 million children were abused or neglected (US Bureau 
              of the Census 1997:219). Because many cases of child abuse go unreported, 
              the actual number of abused children may well be substantially higher 
              (Daro 1988:14-15). 
            <p align=LEFT>Although overall rates remain high, the prevalence of 
              various types of child abuse and neglect appear to be changing. 
              Physical abuse has decreased while sexual abuse has expanded as 
              a proportion of the total percentage of reported cases of child 
              abuse (Costin et al. 1996:138). The latter trend may be changing 
              however as the percentage of <i>substantiated</i> cases of child 
              sexual abuse actually declined between 1990 and 1995 (US Bureau 
              of the Census 1997:218). A majority of parents in the USA continue 
              to use physical punishment, however, and the percentage of parents 
              favouring corporal punishment declined only slightly during the 
              1970s and 1980s (Straus and Gelles 1986; Straus 1994:23-24).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#6">6</a> 
            <p

 align=LEFT>While child abuse is no doubt present within any community in the 
              USA, it can also be found within a variety of religious groups and 
              denominations-perhaps especially among those adhering to a Judaic-Christian 
              tradition. Both the Old and the New Testaments recommend the use 
              of physical punishment on the part of parents to help tame the will 
              of a child (Ellison and Sherkat 1993; Greven 1991). Such intervention 
              is mandated because all persons are believed to be born sinful (that 
              is, displaying ego-centrism and selfishness). Parents thus face 
              the responsibility of 'shaping the will' of their children to ensure 
              they become right with God. Biblical passages giving legitimisation 
              to physical punishment of children are many. Among the most commonly 
              cited are: 'He that spareth the rod hateth his son; but he that 
              loveth him chaseneth him betimes.' 'Withhold no correction from 
              the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. 
              Thou shall beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from 
              hell' (Proverbs 13:24 and 23:13-14, respectively, quoted in Bottoms 
              et al. 1995:87). Accordingly, parents who subscribe to a doctrine 
              of biblical literalism-such as conservative Protestants- are especially 
              prone to using physical punishment as a form of discipline (Ellison 
              and Sherkat 1993). Corporal punishment is viewed both as a necessary 
              and legitimate means to combat the sinfulness of a child, while 
              simultaneously re-enforcing parental (that is, patriarchal) authority. 
            <p align=LEFT>Apart from encouraging and justifying corporal punishment, 
              religious ideas have also been used by parents and religious institutions 
              alike to 'cause emotional pain' by tormenting children through the 
              excessive use of shame and fear (Capps 1992:7-9). The latter researcher 
              concludes that 'religious ideas might be as abusive as physical 
              punishment for children' (1992:8).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#7">7</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>When the average person reflects on child abuse and 
              religion today he or she is likely to identify sexual misconduct 
              by religious officials, particularly on the part of Catholic priests 
              (Berry 1992; Jenkins 1996, 1998). This is largely because sexual 
              misconduct by Catholic priests has received widespread media coverage 
              in the USA and world-wide (for a review, see Jenkins 1996:53-76, 
              1998). Yet, child sexual abuse by clergy is hardly limited to Catholicism 
              (Isely and Isely 1990). The most often quoted survey dealing with 
              sexual problems among Protestant clergy found that 10 percent were 
              involved in sexual misconduct of one sort or another, and that 'about 
              two to three percent' were paedophiles (Rediger 1990:55, quoted 
              in Jenkins 1996). This rate is equal to or perhaps even slightly 
              higher than for Catholic priests (Jenkins 1996:50).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#8">8</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>While the sexual abuse of children is troubling, it 
              becomes doubly so when religious figures are involved. After all, 
              clergy are viewed in most religious traditions as God's ordained 
              representatives, this comprising the very basis of their religious 
              authority. In cases of clergy sexual abuse, religious authority 
              is directly or indirectly used to exploit children, and to cover 
              it up. Clergy who sexually abuse children are often able to escape 
              disclosure, because their status as religious figures shields them 
              from accusations of abuse (Barry 1992; Bottoms et al. 1995). Allegations 
              made by a child concerning clergy sexual misconduct are likely to 
              be ignored, or dismissed as fabrication by parents and other adults 
              (see for example, Barry 1992). Clergy sexual abuse of children, 
              in significant respects, parallels familial incest because it is 
              'often characterised by the same guilt, betrayal of trust, and shame 
              . . .' (Bottoms et al. 1995:90; also see Blanchard 1991:239-240). 
              It is thus hardly surprising to find allegations of clergy sexual 
              misconduct being made by adults victimised as children. 
            <p align=LEFT>As one might expect, sexual abuse by religious authorities 
              is especially damaging to victims. One study concluded that abuse 
              by religious authorities 'is as psychologically damaging, and perhaps 
              <i>more</i> damaging, than even the violently physical abuses of 
              parents whose religious beliefs led them to view their children 
              as evil incarnate' (Bottoms et al. 1995:100). Children molested 
              by religious authorities often suffer from depression, suicidal 
              ideation and affective disorders (Bottoms et al. 1995:99). Moreover, 
              it is not uncommon for those sexually abused by clergy to change 
              religions, or more likely still, to repudiate religion altogether 
              (Bottoms et al. 1995:99). Such an outcome appears even more likely 
              when clergy sexual misconduct is hidden or otherwise covered-up 
              by the church hierarchy. <a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#9">9</a> 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Child abuse within ISKCON schools<br>
              </b>Unlike most instances of child abuse that occur in the home, 
              ISKCON's children were abused and neglected within the confines 
              of the movement's schools, by unrelated adults and older children 
              acting on a teacher's behalf. During these formative years of ISKCON's 
              development, the movement's children were educated in boarding schools, 
              living more or less separate lives from their parents. It was here 
              that some of ISKCON's children were physically, psychologically, 
              and sexually abused.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#10">10</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>As Prabhupada saw the public school system in America 
              as indoctrinating 'children in sense gratification and mental speculation, 
              he referred to the schools as &quot;slaughterhouses&quot;'(J. Goswami 
              1984:1). By contrast, the <i>gurukula,</i> as he envisioned it, 
              was specifically meant to train students in spiritual life, so that 
              they could return back to Godhead. Given that the fundamental goal 
              of the <i>gurukula</i> was to train students in sense control, children 
              were removed from their family as early as age four or five years. 
              Prabhupada believed little hope existed for a child to learn self-control 
              within the nuclear family because of the 'ropes of affection' between 
              parent and child. Children thus attended the <i>gurukula</i> on 
              a year-round basis, with occasional vacations to visit with parents. 
              They resided in <i>ashrams</i> with children of similar age and 
              sex. <i>Ashrams</i> varied in size and the number of children they 
              took in. In 1979 there were 6-8 students living in each of the boys 
              <i>ashrams</i> in Los Angeles. Reports indicate that in other <i>gurukulas</i> 
              the number of students residing in an <i>ashram</i> ranged as high 
              as 20 or more. An adult teacher lived in the <i>ashram</i> and took 
              responsibility for supervising the children, and tending to their 
              day-to-day needs (Rochford 1997). 
            <p align=LEFT>ISKCON's first formal <i>gurukula</i> was established 
              in Dallas, Texas, in 1971. The Dallas <i>gurukula</i> remained the 
              only school of its type within the movement, until 1976, when it 
              was forced to close by state authorities. At the time of its closing 
              the school had approximately 100 students, the majority of whom 
              were between the ages of four and eight. With the impending demise 
              of the Dallas school, <i>gurukulas</i> were established in Los Angeles 
              and at New Vrindaban in 1975. In 1976, the Bhaktivedanta Swami International 
              Gurukula began accepting adolescent boys as students in Vrindavan, 
              India.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#11">11</a> Between 1975 and 
              1978 a total of 11 ISKCON schools opened in the North America. <i>Gurukulas</i> 
              also started in France, Australia, South Africa, England and Sweden, 
              in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Regional schools appeared in 
              Lake Huntington, New York, and central California (Bhaktivedanta 
              Village), in 1980 and 1981 respectively (Das, M. 1998). 
            <p align=LEFT>As the last two regionally based <i>ashram-gurukulas</i> 
              closed in North America by 1986, ISKCON schools became almost exclusively 
              day-schools. The only exception in North America today is the Vaisnava 
              Academy for Girls located in Alachua, Florida, for high school aged 
              women. The school has both day-students and students living full-time 
              in the <i>ashram</i>.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#12">12</a> World-wide 
              only the Vrindavan and Mayapur, India, schools remain <i>ashram</i>-only 
              <i>gurukulas.</i> A sizeable majority of ISKCON's children in North 
              America presently attend state-supported schools (Rochford 1997, 
              forthcoming), a trend found in a number of other countries as well. 
            <p align=LEFT>Reports by second generation youth, parents and educators 
              alike suggest that a proportion of the children who attended the 
              <i>gurukula</i> suffered psychological, physical and sexual abuse. 
              Yet it remains unclear just how many children were abused directly, 
              or otherwise witnessed their friends and classmates being abused. 
              The latter represents a form of psychological abuse in its own right. 
            <p align=LEFT>Lacking reliable quantitative findings, it becomes extremely 
              difficult to determine with any degree of precision what the actual 
              incidence of child abuse was within ISKCON's <i>gurukulas.</i> Unfortunately, 
              we are left to estimates of uncertain quality. Over the years any 
              number of estimates have been offered ranging from 20% of all students 
              who attended an <i>ashram-gurukula</i> suffering some form of abuse, 
              to as many as 75% of the boys enrolled at the Vrindavan, India, 
              <i>gurukula</i> having been sexually molested during the late 1970s 
              and early 1980s. Whatever the actual incidence of child abuse, it 
              remains clear that abuse directly and indirectly influenced the 
              lives of a sizeable number of children. Yet, child abuse did not 
              occur uniformly, either across <i>gurukulas,</i> or, very often, 
              even within the same school. As one long-time teacher concluded, 
            <ul>
              <p>child abuse . . . wasn't all-pervasive. It wasn't in all <i>gurukulas.</i> 
                It didn't affect all children. But it was in enough schools and 
                affected enough children and it went on for enough time . . .

            </ul>
            <p>Abuse and neglect within the <i>gurukula</i> took a variety of 
              forms. The following statements from young adults and former <i>gurukula</i> 
              students indicate the kinds of abuse that occurred. 
            <ul>
              <p>&nbsp;. . . I remember dark closets filled with flying dates 
                (large three inch, flying cockroaches) and such, while beatings 
                and 'no <i>prasadam</i>' for dinner became everyday affairs. (Devi 
                Dasi, K. 1990:1) 
              <p>Seattle was hell because I was only six years old, my mom lived 
                in Hawaii and I had always been a very shy mommy's girl. The movement 
                was in its earlier stages and the devotees were fanatical-beyond 
                fanatical. I mean, they would give us a bowl of hot milk at night, 
                so I would, of course, pee in my bed. Then as punishment they 
                would spank me very hard and make me wear the contaminated panties 
                on my head. In general, at that time, because I was so young, 
                I was so spaced out and confused. I would cry. . .for my mom, 
                but that wasn't allowed, so I would say I was crying in devotional 
                ecstasy. I really regret Seattle because I had a dire need for 
                my mother's warmth and reassurance at that time in my life. (Second 
                Generation Survey 1992) 
              <p>The teacher use to say, 'Oh, you don't know when you are going 
                to die. You could die in your sleep.' And one day I was really 
                bad and one of my teachers said, 'Who knows you might die tonight. 
                Krishna might be punishing you. He might be taking away your life 
                . . .' And from that night on I use to pray every night, 'Krishna 
                please don't kill me. I promise I will be a good girl tomorrow. 
                Please let me get fixed up enough so I can go back to Godhead. 
                Don't take me in my sleep.' And for years I had insomnia. I was 
                too afraid to go back to sleep. (Interview 1991)<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#14">14</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Two young men recount their days as students in the Vrindavan, 
              India, <i>gurukula</i> during the early 1980s. 
            <ul>
              <p><b>X:</b> I wasn't afraid of being sexually molested. I don't 
                think I was afraid of being mentally abused either. I was definitely 
                afraid of being physically abused . . . Sexual molestation, all 
                of us, man, we'd just take it, you know. . . That's what we all 
                felt. We didn't even consider it abuse back then. <br>
                <b>XX:</b> Yeah, that was just normal. . .The ironic thing about 
                that, though, is probably the mental thing [abuse] was probably 
                the longest lasting. <br>
                <b>X:</b> There was no way to escape that. (Group Interview 1993) 
            </ul>
            <p>As word of child abuse within the <i>gurukula</i> came to the attention 
              of ISKCON authorities, some efforts were made to intervene. Yet 
              this very intervention sometimes resulted in new strategies of coercive 
              abuse. Most significant was enlisting older boys in the Vrindavan 
              <i>gurukula</i> to physically abuse younger students who were deemed 
              troublesome and unruly by teachers. 
            <ul>
              <p><b>X:</b> The other thing was that older boys acting in the capacity 
                of monitors were used to abuse the younger students. Some started 
                to realise that 'Hey, teachers can't be beating kids.' They did 
                it in a new way. <br>
                <b>EBR:</b> With the monitors. <br>
                <b>X:</b> Yeah. Which was the older boys beating the younger boys, 
                and I was one of the older ones . . .and they [teachers] would 
                call me in on occasion and I would just have to knock the living 
                s--- [out of a younger student] . . . I'd be sitting there going 
                'Man, I love you. I don't want to be doing this. . .' [I]t's like,' 
                what are you gonna do? If I don't do it to you, they're gonna 
                do it to me.'<br>
                <b>XX:</b> That's another kind of mental abuse. (Group Interview, 
                1993) 
            </ul>
            <p>While a porportion of ISKCON's children were themselves abused, 
              others experienced the abuse as they watched their friends and classmates 
              being mistreated by teachers and others responsible for their care. 
            <ul>
              <p>If the teachers treated one of our friends bad then we all felt 
                bad. I remember there was one teacher that use to grab one of 
                us by the ears and bang us against the wall. And we all stood 
                there and watched and felt really bad. . . She [the teacher] was 
                doing it to all of us. (Interview 1992) 
              <p> Maybe what [name of <i>ashram</i> teacher] was doing to [name 
                of student] was hurting others [students] more than him. For [name 
                of student] it was an everyday thing. I was standing right next 
                to [him] and I was crying. I was freaked out. I was afraid I was 
                gonna be next because I knew he was gettin' it for no reason. 
                If he could get it for no reason so could I. (Group interview 
                1993) 
            </ul>
            <p>In the school in Vrindavan, India, abusive treatment became so 
              commonplace that students sought to routinise their mistreatment 
              as a protective strategy. 
            <ul>
              <p>It was like boot camp, but it wasn't temporary. You became part 
                of a unit. Boot camp was a full-time thing for us. They're just 
                constantly knocking you down, knocking you down. . . lower, lower, 
                lower. What are they gonna do? Beat me again? Go ahead. (Laughter). 
                Big deal! (Group interview 1993) 
            </ul>
            <p>But beyond the question of young people being abused by adults 
              working in the <i>gurukula</i><a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#15"> 
              15</a> was the general environment of neglect that existed. Without 
              parents present, many felt abandoned, or as one second generation 
              youth remarked, 'We were just unwanted.' Many of the young people 
              interviewed described the atmosphere in the <i>gurukula</i> as one 
              lacking in love and compassion. They felt invisible, abandoned and 
              unworthy of love and affection from both their parents and adult 
              caregivers.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#16">16</a> 
            <p><b>Accounting for child abuse<br>
              </b>In this section, I explore a number of factors that combined 
              to create a context conducive to child abuse within the <i>gurukula</i> 
              during the 1970s and 1980s. The first of these is somewhat different 
              from the others because it defines the broader milieu in which parents 
              and children lived within ISKCON's communities. Put simply, marriage 
              and family life came to symbolise spiritual failure, and children 
              a sexual product of that failure. Following this discussion, I then 
              consider three specific factors which fostered child abuse and neglect: 
              (1) <i>Sankirtan</i> and competing demands on parents; (2) Lack 
              of institutional support for the <i>gurukula;</i> and, (3) Exclusion 
              of parents from the <i>gurukula</i> and, thereby, from the everyday 
              lives of their children.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#17">17</a> 
              I end this section by considering how some children were able to 
              escape abuse. 
            <p><i> Attitudes Toward Marriage, Family Life, and Children<br>
              </i>ISKCON scholar and leader Ravindra Svarupa dasa argues that 
              marriage and family life were viewed favourably during ISKCON's 
              early days. As he states, 'When I joined ISKCON [1971] it was assumed 
              that everyone would become married, and indeed devotees were urged 
              to do so' (1994:9). But this view changed after Prabhupada became 
              increasingly discouraged by the marital problems encountered by 
              his disciples. In a 1972 letter he wrote 'I am so much disgusted 
              with this troublesome business of marriage, because nearly every 
              day I receive some complaint from husband or wife. . .so henceforth 
              I am not sanctioning any more marriages . . .' (Prabhupada 1992:866).<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#18">18</a> 
              As Prabhupada withdrew from 'the troublesome business of marriage,' 
              local Temple Presidents and other ISKCON authorities (that is, regional 
              secretaries, GBC representatives) assumed the responsibility for 
              arranging marriages and otherwise dealing with the problems and 
              needs of householders. The result was married life underwent a fundamental 
              transformation in meaning and value within ISKCON. 
            <p>Marriage came to represent a sign of spiritual weakness, a concession 
              for those too weak to control their sexual desires. Such a view 
              applied differently to men and women however. The ideal for a man 
              was to maintain a life of renunciation, avoiding marriage if at 
              all possible. Spiritual and material fulfilment for women by contrast 
              was defined in terms of marriage and family life (Rochford 1997). 
              Given the prevalence of these ideas, women became threats to a man's 
              spiritual advancement. 
            <p>The changed atmosphere surrounding marriage and family life turned 
              contentious by the mid-1970s as renunciate leaders undertook a preaching 
              campaign against householder life and women. As Ravindra Svarupa 
              dasa suggests, this brought about growing conflict and factionalism 
              within ISKCON. 
            <ul>
              <p>Some of these <i>sannyasis</i> embarked on preaching campaigns 
                against householders and even more so against women, whose life 
                in the movement at this time became extremely trying. Feelings 
                grew so heated that in 1976, a clash between householder temple 
                presidents in North America and a powerful association of peripatetic 
                <i>sannyasis</i> and <i>brahmacaris</i> escalated into a conflict 
                so major that Srila Prabhupada called it a 'fratricidal war' (1994:9). 
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the ongoing denigration of marriage and family life and 
              the corresponding loss of status accorded householders, most devotees 
              ultimately married. By 1980, there appears to have been about an 
              equal number of married and unmarried devotees residing within ISKCON's 
              North American communities. About one-quarter had children (Rochford 
              1997). Conversely, a survey in 1991-92 (N=268) revealed that a sizeable 
              majority of ISKCON's North American membership were married, or 
              previously married. Only 15% had never been married. Family life 
              also expanded with a substantial majority (70%) of those surveyed 
              in 1991-92 having one or more children.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#19">19</a> 
              By the onset of the 1990s, ISKCON had become a householder's movement 
              in North America (Rochford 1997), and increasingly world-wide (Rochford 
              1995b). 
            <p>Even with the rapid expansion of marriage and family life, anti-householder 
              attitudes changed little organisationally.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#20">20</a> 
              Householder life remained a 'dark-well' spiritually. Many parents 
              who accepted the leadership's ideas about marriage and family sought 
              to counteract their lowly status by placing their commitment to 
              ISKCON and Krishna Consciousness above their family obligations. 
              This presented a burden of considerable proportions for both parents 
              and their children. One second generation woman suggests just how 
              difficult this proved to be for her own mother. 
            <ul>
              <p>But sometimes I would look at her and I could see her being torn 
                apart inside. I could see how she yearned to be a mother once 
                again; sewing by the fire, cooking our dinners, and helping us 
                with our hard days at school, and at the same time trying her 
                hardest to please the Guru and the community by showing her <i>detachment 
                to her family</i>. (My emphasis; Devi Dasi, K. 1990:14) 
            </ul>
            <p>As householder life became disparaged children too were defined 
              and redefined in ways that undermined their status, and ultimately 
              the care they received within the <i>gurukula.</i> Up until the 
              early 1980s, children born within ISKCON were commonly portrayed 
              as being spiritually pure. After all, it was believed that their 
              souls had progressed spiritually to the point where they had gained 
              the good fortune of taking birth in a devotee family. Yet this view 
              changed by the mid-1980s as some leaders complained that ISKCON's 
              children were turning out to be little more than 'karmis' (that 
              is, non-religious outsiders), and, therefore, <i> gurukula</i> had 
              failed in its mission to produce spiritually advanced children. 
              Both of these frameworks, I want to argue, became justifications 
              used by the leadership to dismiss the gurukula, the children, and 
              their responsibility toward both.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#21">21</a> 
            <p>As two long-time ISKCON teachers recount, 
            <ul>
              <p>They [leadership] put a lot of energy into making new devotees 
                from outside the community. But you didn't have to put any energy 
                into making children into devotees, or so they thought . . . And 
                I think there was a lot of misconception about how Prabhupada 
                thought the children [were] conceived. They thought that if the 
                children were conceived properly then it was a cinch. And that 
                makes no sense at all. I compare it to going through a store and 
                buying good seeds and then you don't plant them, you don't water 
                them, you just throw them around . . . So many things that we 
                assumed, that we never sat down and analysed. We just took it 
                for granted; That the children were born into the movement, and 
                particularly if they were conceived properly of chanting five 
                hours of Hare Krishna. Does that make sense? It never made sense 
                to me. I always assumed that we would train the children, that 
                we could never take their Krishna Consciousness, or their character, 
                or anything for granted. (Interview 1990) 
              <p> And everyone just thought that you send them away to the <i>gurukula</i> 
                and when they came back they were going to be like Prahlada Maharaja 
                [a spiritually-realised child devotee of Krishna]. They were going 
                to be chanting <i>japa.</i> They were going to be shaved-up. They 
                were going to be distributing books. They were going to be nice 
                little chaste wives, rolling <i>chapatis.</i> (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>Yet, by the mid-1980s, as the children were growing into teenagers, 
              understandings of the second generation and the <i>gurukula</i> 
              began to change. To the surprise of many leaders and parents alike, 
              the children raised in the <i>gurukula</i> were less than pure spiritually. 
              Few were committed to a life of renunciation and full-time involvement 
              in ISKCON (Rochford forthcoming). As a result, some leaders openly 
              challenged the need for the <i>gurukula</i> altogether. Economic 
              decline, as I discuss below, made this view all the more attractive 
              to some leaders. 
            <ul>
              <p>But they [the leaders] did not go back and become introspective 
                and say 'Well, we should have been taking care of these things. 
                Let's get it together now. We made a mistake, whether an honest 
                mistake or not. Let's now provide an excellent education for the 
                children. Let's rebuild the community's faith in ISKCON.' They 
                didn't do that. They took (laugh) the opposite track. Instead 
                of saying 'the kids are going to turn out good no matter what,' 
                now they were saying 'things are going to turn out bad no matter 
                what you do.' The leaders' position was, 'No, we did everything 
                right. We did what Prabhupada said. We had <i>ashrams.</i> We 
                had these nice schools. These wonderful schools. And everything 
                went bad anyway. So why should we put a lot of energy into it 
                [the <i>gurukula</i>]. We're just kidding ourselves. Right.' (Interview, 
                ISKCON teacher 1990) 
            </ul>
            <p>But these two very different frameworks for constructing ISKCON's 
              children functionally served the same purpose. In the first instance 
              leaders saw no reason to invest resources in the <i>gurukula</i> 
              because it couldn't fail, given the elevated spiritual status of 
              the children. The second framework, precisely because it emphasised 
              failure, rather than success, likewise rejected the need to maintain 
              a viable system of education. As I argue in the next section, however, 
              the <i>gurukula</i> did serve a crucial function for ISKCON, one 
              that ultimately had little to do with educating and socialising 
              ISKCON's next generation. 
            <p><i> Sankirtan and the Gurukula<br>
              </i>Although ISKCON's <i>sannyasi</i> leadership believed that a 
              loss in standing would discourage marriage, as we have seen, the 
              solid majority of ISKCON's membership married, and most had children. 
              The growth of marriage and family represented a significant threat 
              to <i>sankirtan,</i> and thereby to ISKCON itself.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#22">22</a> 
              <i>Sankirtan</i> served ISKCON's mission in two respects. First, 
              it represented the principle means by which the movement proselytised 
              its Krishna conscious beliefs. In fact, Prabhupada continually emphasised 
              that book distribution represented <i>the</i> means to spread Krishna 
              Consciousness in America and world-wide. Secondly, and of equal 
              importance, <i>sankirtan</i> supported ISKCON's communities financially. 
              Without a work force of dedicated <i>sankirtan</i> devotees, ISKCON's 
              missionary goals and financial stability were placed in jeopardy. 
              The solution rested with the <i>gurukula</i> because it relieved 
              parents of the burdens of childcare, thus affording them the opportunity 
              to work full-time <i>sankirtan.</i> Put differently, the <i>gurukula</i> 
              allowed ISKCON's leaders to reclaim householders for <i>sankirtan,</i> 
              a move that only grew in importance as ISKCON's North American communities 
              faced deepening economic decline by the late 1970s (Rochford 1985, 
              1995c). As one parent described, 
            <ul>
              <p>We got the children, the bothersome children from the leader's 
                perspective, we got them out of the way by putting them in the 
                <i>gurukula.</i> Now the adults could do some work. Go out on 
                <i>sankirtan.</i> This was a very present issue, freeing up the 
                parents. (Interview 1990) 
            </ul>
            <p>To a leadership concerned primarily with distributing Prabhupada's 
              books and raising funds, the <i>gurukula</i> communalised child 
              care, thus freeing parents to work on behalf of ISKCON and its mission. 
              Not surprisingly, many of the young people who attended the <i>gurukula</i> 
              during this period saw ISKCON's schools in precisely these terms. 
            <ul>
              <p>I did feel that my mom used the <i>gurukula</i> as a convenience 
                for not keeping me around. My mother later told me her authorities 
                strongly encouraged her to put us there so we would not hinder 
                her <i>sankirtan</i> service. (Second Generation Survey 1992) 
            </ul>
            <p>Findings from my 1992-93 Second Generation Survey in North America 
              make this point more forcefully. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of those 
              surveyed (N=87) agreed with the statement, 'The <i>ashram gurukula</i> 
              primarily served the interests of parents and ISKCON, rather than 
              the spiritual and academic needs of children.' One quarter of those 
              surveyed (26%) agreed strongly with the statement. 
            <p>Freeing parents for <i>sankirtan</i> was facilitated by enrolling 
              children in the <i>gurukula</i> as early as age three or four, although 
              the majority enrolled at age five. Some ISKCON communities communalised 
              children even earlier, establishing day-care centres for infants 
              and toddlers. One such community was ISKCON's New Vrindaban community, 
              in West Virginia. 
            <ul>
              <p>Kirtanananda [New Vrindaban's former guru and leader] was very 
                successful because he had a nursery from day one. For those kids 
                born at New Vrindaban, he took the kids and communalised them. 
                They got so much work out of the people in that community. (Interview 
                1990) 
            </ul>
            <p>A second generation woman who grew up at New Vrindaban recalls: 
            <ul>
              <p>[S]oon after Kapila was born . . . the <i>Guru</i> of the farm 
                asked her [mother] to go travel and preach in airports, she sadly 
                said 'yes.' Kapila was only three months old when she left him 
                to be brought up by some other lady who lived on the farm. For 
                months she cried at night wondering if he was okay and yet her 
                body could hardly stand any more emotional work after standing 
                nearly twelve hours that day, . . . collecting donations from 
                strangers. (Devi Dasi, K. 1990:14) 
            </ul>
            <p>An indication of the leadership's motivation in providing child 
              care at New Vrindaban is suggested by a saying used in the community 
              to refer to expectant mothers; 'Dump the load and hit the road.' 
              And to 'hit the road' meant returning to full-time <i>sankirtan.</i> 
              While leaders in other ISKCON communities were clearly more subtle 
              and humanistic in their approach, they were no less anxious to return 
              mothers to full-time <i>sankirtan,</i> or other work on behalf of 
              the community. For the fact was, women were among the very best 
              <i>sankirtan</i> workers in the movement. 
            <p><i>Sankirtan</i> represented the foundation of ISKCON's sectarian 
              world, and the movement's <i>sannyasi</i> elite took measures to 
              assure that it was protected against the presumed deleterious effects 
              associated with the expansion of marriage and family life. While 
              initially established to spiritually educate ISKCON's children, 
              the <i>gurukula</i> ultimately served the interests of ISKCON's 
              missionary activity, and the need to raise money in support of the 
              movement's communal way of life. One long-time teacher from this 
              era underscores the primary interest of ISKCON's <i>sannyasi</i> 
              leadership. 
            <ul>
              <p>And you had to have a vision for the future to even understand 
                why you were doing this [the <i>gurukula</i>]. For the teachers 
                this might have been there but for the administration of ISKCON, 
                what it means is that you are paying for a day-care centre. These 
                kids cause trouble wherever they are . . . You are talking about 
                <i>sannyasis</i> who are thinking like, 'Get these kids out of 
                here. And look how much money I am having to pay to get these 
                kids out of here. And look at how many devotees have to be there 
                [in the <i>gurukula</i>] to get these kids out of the way.' That 
                was the whole psyche surrounding how the school was put together. 
                (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>The importance placed on <i>sankirtan</i> by ISKCON's leadership 
              meant that the significance of the <i>gurukula</i> rested on its 
              childcare function, rather than as an educational institution. Moreover, 
              as parents faced increasing pressures to engage in <i>sankirtan</i> 
              many had little ability to commit time to the needs of their children. 
              Children and family life threatened ISKCON's purpose as a missionary 
              movement, but each also threatened the financial base upon which 
              the authority of the leadership rested. 
            <p><i> Lack of Institutional Support for Gurukula<br>
              </i>Given the leadership's view of <i>gurukula</i> and its purposes, 
              it failed to provide the support necessary to maintain an educational 
              institution. Throughout its existence the <i>gurukula</i> operated 
              with insufficient staffing, funding and oversight. I want to suggest 
              now that in failing to provide the resources and management necessary 
              to maintain the <i>gurukula,</i> it became an institution defined 
              by neglect, isolation and marginalisation. Because of these qualities, 
              the <i>gurukula</i> also became a context in which ISKCON's children 
              became subject to abuse. 
            <p>From the inception of the gurukula system in Dallas it faced a 
              shortage of trained and qualified staff to serve as academic and 
              ashram teachers. In American culture we have a saying, 'Those who 
              can't do otherwise, teach.' ISKCON, during the 1970s and 1980s, 
              had its equivalent, 'Those who can't do <i>sankirtan,</i> work in 
              the <i>gurukula</i>.' As a <i>gurukula</i> teacher of some twenty 
              years commented, 'The <i>gurukula</i> was the dumping ground as 
              far as getting staff went. When devotees couldn't do other things 
              like going on <i>sankirtan</i> they were sent to work in the <i>gurukula</i>.' 
              The result was that outside of a limited number of professional 
              academic teachers, ISKCON's schools were staffed by devotees untrained 
              and generally ill-prepared to take on the demands of working with 
              children. Moreover, because there was little or no status attached 
              to working in the <i>gurukula,</i> many devotees had little or no 
              desire to be there. Success at <i>sankirtan</i> brought individual 
              recognition within the devotee community, working with children, 
              invisibility and a loss of status.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#23">23</a> 
              As one ISKCON parent commented. 
            <ul>
              <p>I was concerned that the teachers were often selected based on 
                their inability to do <i>sankirtan,</i> rather than because they 
                loved children and education. As far as I could see, there were 
                no mandatory classes in childhood development for teachers or 
                staff either. How could anyone expect those in charge to know 
                what was normal or abnormal behaviours and how it should be dealt 
                with? (Anonymous a 1996) 
            </ul>
            <p>As a former <i>gurukula</i> teacher and Headmaster makes clear, 
              it was assumed that any devotee who was steady in his or her spiritual 
              practice was qualified to work in the <i>gurukula.</i> Yet as he 
              further explains, few were able to stand up to the everyday demands 
              of working with children. 
            <ul>
              <p>&nbsp;There were very few qualified or experienced teachers in 
                the early <i>Gurukula</i> at Dallas . . . At that time in ISKCON 
                in general there was a hubris about individual qualification. 
                It was thought that a devotee who was chanting his rounds was 
                empowered to do anything and that he did not need any special 
                training. The task of dealing with a hundred children or so from 
                morning to night on tough schedule through <i>mangal arati</i> 
                to bedtime was too much for most of them. (Brzezinski 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>As the above remarks make clear, working in the <i>gurukula</i> 
              was stressful, especially for an untrained staff lacking sufficient 
              interest in children. This was all the more so in instances where 
              a single <i>ashram</i> teacher was responsible for the care of 20 
              or more children. These conditions contributed directly to acts 
              of child abuse by teachers. As one teacher from this era observes, 
              'There may have been some [teachers involved in abusing children] 
              who were actually diabolical. But in most cases it was a lack of 
              expertise, lack of training, lack of assistance, lack of knowing 
              who to go to.' And, as the former Headmaster of one school, described, 
            <ul>
              <p>Therefore, we have someone like [name of <i>ashram </i> teacher] 
                who is put into a situation in which he does not belong. It is 
                so stressful. So therefore a kid gets out of line-what to speak 
                of his other transgressions-and he pushes him hard and the kid 
                falls on the floor and breaks his arm. And that's what happened. 
                (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p> But while finding people capable of working in the <i>gurukula</i> 
              was an ongoing problem, retaining them represented another. Many 
              second generation youth tell of having as many as 15, 20, or more, 
              <i>ashram</i>-teachers during their time in the <i>gurukula.</i> 
              Eight in ten (82%) of the second generation youth surveyed in 1991-92 
              agree that, 'The major reason for the demise of the <i>ashram</i>-based 
              <i>gurukulas</i> was the lack of qualified teachers.' The former 
              Headmaster quoted above suggests one reason why. 
            <ul>
              <p>At one point they sent all the kids from [region of the country] 
                to our school in Lake Huntington. So now we have this big regional 
                school. Then at one point [<i>guru</i> from that region] decides 
                that he needs the <i>ashram</i> teacher [for the oldest boys] 
                to do some other service . . . So I call him [<i>guru</i>] and 
                say, 'Listen there is no one but me. I am the Headmaster. I'm 
                already doing this and that. Now I am going to have to do the 
                <i>ashram</i>. There is nobody here that can do it.' He just said, 
                'Well you are just going to have to get somebody. Good-bye.' Pull 
                the man out so now we have 16 older boys who don't have a teacher. 
                What to do? (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>The effect of an ever-changing complement of <i>gurukula</i> teachers 
              and staff meant that the children were unable to build and sustain 
              meaningful and perhaps loving relationships with their adult caregivers. 
              This very fact only increased the likelihood that children might 
              be neglected and/or abused.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#24">24</a> 
            <p>The question of 'What to do?' only intensified as ISKCON in North 
              America faced growing economic decline. By 1982, the level of ISKCON's 
              book distribution in North America was less than half its 1978 peak 
              (Rochford 1985, 1995c). The corresponding drop in <i>sankirtan</i> 
              revenues had a devastating effect on ISKCON's communities. It also 
              had a dramatic impact on the <i>gurukula,</i> which, even in the 
              best of economic times, faced hardship. As the Headmaster of one 
              school made clear, 'Even at the peak of our movement's resources 
              . . . the <i>gurukula</i> was getting barely anything. Anything. 
              And so as soon as there was less to go around it barely got anything 
              at all' (interview, 1997). Below he describes the financial difficulties 
              encountered by the Lake Huntington <i>gurukula</i> just prior to 
              its closing in 1986. 
            <ul>
              <p>More difficult was our financial situation. And what happened. 
                When New York was broken up, Lake Huntington, Long Island, New 
                Jersey, and Manhattan each of these areas was assigned a certain 
                number of collectors, . . . <i> sankirtan</i> devotees. Four months 
                after the break-up I was shifted from Long Island to Lake Huntington 
                and I took over the project. Within a few months I became the 
                Headmaster. We had eight <i>sankirtan</i> devotees. We were struggling 
                but were making it. But the zone was collapsing [financially]. 
                So the new GBC man . . . came in and took all the <i>sankirtan</i> 
                devotees and centralised it. The plan was to just give money to 
                the different temples in the zone. We lost our eight <i>sankirtan 
                </i> devotees and we were promised $8 000 a month, which we got 
                for one month. They reduced and reduced the amount until we got 
                $2 100 to pay the mortgage. When we asked what to do they said 
                take more students [thereby gaining more tuitions]. And that's 
                what we did. Until finally it dawned on us that we were killing 
                our teachers and cheating our students. We can't run a school 
                like this. That was the environment we were actually functioning 
                in.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#25"> 25</a> (Interview1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>A final issue here has to do with the apparent lack of oversight 
              the <i>gurukula</i> received by ISKCON leaders. While it is true 
              that there was a Minister of Education whose responsibility was 
              to provide guidance and leadership for ISKCON's schools, it appears, 
              nonetheless, that the <i>gurukula</i> failed to gain the attention 
              and supervision required. And, without it, the likelihood of child 
              neglect and abuse grew. As one teacher described, the leadership 
              simply placed too little importance on the <i>gurukula.</i> 
            <ul>
              <p>I have come to the conclusion that they [the leadership] aren't 
                going to do anything; at all, not anything. They should have done 
                something twenty years ago, or fifteen years ago. They had plenty 
                of opportunity. They had money. They had man-power. They had Srila 
                Prabhupada right there behind them. Why didn't they take it? I 
                can tell you why they didn't do it. They didn't think it was important. 
                Obviously. (Interview, 1990) 
            </ul>
            <p>One indication of the leaders' disinterest can be seen in the way 
              ISKCON's renunciate leaders responded when parents complained about 
              the mistreatment of children in the <i>gurukula.</i> As a second 
              generation youth recounts: 
            <ul>
              <p>When I was five and a half years old, I'd been in gurukula (Dallas) 
                since its insemination (about three years). My dad had gone to 
                Dallas (against the wishes of his temple authority who only cared 
                about my dad's money-making ability on <i>sankirtan</i>) after 
                discovering bruises all over my body on a <i>Rathayatra</i> [festival] 
                visit. After much discussion with the school authority he found 
                that he could not get them to change the policy of daily beatings. 
                He removed me from the school. Very disillusioned he nearly left 
                ISKCON. On hearing that Prabhupada would be in LA, we went there. 
                When Prabhupada saw me he asked why I was not in the <i>gurukula.</i> 
                My father told him that he'd removed me because of the daily beatings. 
                Prabhupada told him that I belonged in <i>gurukula</i> and that 
                if my dad had a problem with the treatment he should work to resolve 
                it . . . [Prabhupada] did nothing to resolve the situation. Instead 
                of going himself or sending one of his top people to resolve the 
                problems he sent my dad who had never had any power. Needless 
                to say when my dad returned to Dallas nobody listened to him. 
                If a problem arose at some temple or other, Prabhupada was more 
                than willing to go or send someone effective to handle the situation, 
                but for the kids he sent my dad who was effective at getting people 
                to give him money. (Anonymous b 1996) (See footnote <a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#26">26</a> 
                for further discussion of Prabhupada's response to allegations 
                of child abuse.) 
            </ul>
            <p>After Prabhupada's death, the response of the newly appointed <i>gurus</i> 
              was apparently much the same. 
            <ul>
              <p>Kutila [woman gurukula teacher] was furious when she saw the 
                cuts and beating marks and she ran to tell Bhaktipada who coolly 
                said, 'Don't complain, do something about it, if you think you 
                can do any better.' (Devi Dasi, K. 1990:1) 
            </ul>
            <p>Initially the leadership's disinterest in the gurukula stemmed 
              from an overriding concern with maintaining and indeed expanding 
              <i>sankirtan.</i> Yet with Prabhupada's death in November, 1977, 
              however, ISKCON faced years of succession problems that preoccupied 
              the movement as a whole. As ISKCON's newly appointed <i>gurus</i> 
              struggled to establish their own religious and political authority, 
              and attract disciples, householders and their children lost further 
              relevance organisationally (Rochford 1995a). This became all the 
              more so in the early 1980s as book distribution virtually collapsed 
              in North America, and parents were pushed outside of ISKCON's communities 
              to find employment in support of themselves and their families (see 
              Rochford 1997). (For a treatment of ISKCON's succession problems, 
              see Rochford 1985: 221-55, 1998a. On how acceptance or rejection 
              of ISKCON leaders' authority influences types and levels of ISKCON 
              involvement, see Rochford 1995a.) 
            <p><i>Exclusion of Parents from the Gurukula<br>
              </i>One potential safeguard against child abuse rested with parental 
              involvement and oversight of the <i>gurukula.</i> If children were 
              being abused and neglected there is reason to believe that involved 
              parents might well have become aware and taken corrective actions. 
              Yet in most instances this did not happen, and when it did, parental 
              concerns were often ignored or dismissed, as we saw in the previous 
              section. The fact was parents were actively discouraged from becoming 
              involved in the <i>gurukula,</i> and, thereby, from the day-to-day 
              lives of their children. 
            <p> Prabhupada himself discouraged parent involvement in the <i>gurukula.</i> 
              He reasoned that the best interests of ISKCON's children were served 
              by communalising them within the context of the <i>gurukula.</i> 
              Away from parental influence, a child would more readily take to 
              a life of spiritual practice and renunciation. As Prabhupada stated 
              in a 1973 letter, 'Regarding <i>gurukula,</i> it is not required 
              that parents live there with their children. We can take care of 
              children, but not the parents' (1992:794). While relinquishing their 
              children to the <i>gurukula</i> proved difficult for many parents, 
              they took solace in the knowledge that their children were advancing 
              spiritually. 
            <p>The idea that parents represented a threat to the spiritual lives 
              of children was widely promoted throughout ISKCON, and was accepted 
              by many devotee parents. As we have seen, ISKCON's leadership promoted 
              this idea as a means to reclaim parents for <i>sankirtan.</i> Accepting 
              the 'ideological work' (Berger 1981; Rochford 1985:191-220) of the 
              leadership, many parents maintained minimal contact with their children. 
              In fact, it appears that in some cases parents essentially abandoned 
              their children to the <i>gurukula.</i> Teachers, too, considered 
              parents as threats to the spiritual well-being of their children. 
              In the words of one teacher: 
            <ul>
              <p> There is a problem with parents. The experience that we have 
                had in <i>gurukula</i> is that much of the training that you are 
                trying to give the child is lost when the child is with the parents. 
                Because the parent is not maintaining the same standards, or doesn't 
                have the same abilities, whatever it is . . . And you knew as 
                a teacher that when you sent a kid home for three and a half weeks 
                [for vacation] you knew you were going to get a basket case when 
                they came back. (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p> As this teacher further suggests, this way of thinking influenced 
              strongly how those working in the <i>gurukula</i> treated parents. 
            <ul>
              <p>And so maybe unfortunately, in retrospect, the wrong attitude 
                was conveyed about parents. The parents are a problem; keep the 
                parents away, all of that. (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>The larger consequence of these ideas was the virtual exclusion 
              of parents from the <i>gurukula.</i> Parental involvement with their 
              children was largely unwelcome. Moreover, when children did return 
              to their parents' home community for school vacations, these visits 
              very often afforded limited opportunities for parent and child to 
              spend time together. As one mother and teacher explained: 
            <ul>
              <p>You have to remember that parents didn't have houses. They didn't 
                have their own place. We never had a house . . . So when you say 
                a kid went home, that's a euphemism. He went to the temple. His 
                mother had service that she was doing all along. His father had 
                service that he was doing all along. And now all of a sudden this 
                kid is there. So now what does he do? He hangs around the temple. 
                He gets stepped on by people as they are coming up the stairs 
                [into the temple] . . . And he wants his mother's attention when 
                she is cooking for the deities. The fact is no one took care of 
                the kids . . . The kid did whatever he did. And the parents just 
                kept on doing whatever it was they were doing. (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>A second generation devotee recounts her vacations from school 
              and the burden these visits placed on her and other family members. 
            <ul>
              <p>When I got older, I started to spend my vacations with my <i>Mata.</i> 
                But vacation time for me was not vacation time for her. For Kapila 
                [her brother] and I, she would get a motel room every night but 
                her service to the temple still came first. Only after she had 
                chanted all of her rounds without interruption and she had collected 
                at least three hundred dollars did Kapila and I get to do anything. 
                We usually would sit for six hours in the cold van parked outside 
                a shopping mall and wait for her. Finally she would finish, and 
                even though her back was aching and her shoulders were heavy from 
                carrying a ninety pound bag of books all day, she somehow would 
                find the energy to sneak us into a nearby pool and then take us 
                to ice cream. But most of the time we didn't see how tired she 
                really was and so, whining and complaining about how little attention 
                we got, we sometimes drove her to tears. (Devi Dasi, K. 1990:12) 
            </ul>
            <p>The <i>gurukulas</i> in India undertook what can only be described 
              as extreme efforts to further isolate children from their parents. 
              In the Vrindavan <i>gurukula</i> it appears that the administration 
              of the school monitored, and sometimes censured, letters written 
              by students to their parents. When a student attempted to write 
              his parents about the negligent and abusive conditions found at 
              the school, he was reprimanded and told to re-write his letter. 
            <ul>
              <p><b>X:</b> I used to write letters to my mom, during the rough 
                times, saying, 'Get me out of here.' And he [school administrator] 
                read them and would tear'em up and make me write new ones.<br>
                <b>XX:</b> He did that to me too. (Group Interview, 1993) 
            </ul>
            <p>In other cases, students in the Vrindavan <i>gurukula</i> avoided 
              writing to their parents about the conditions found at the school 
              because they assumed their letters would be read by the administration, 
              or, as in the case below, they feared their parents would reject 
              allegations of abuse. As one mother explained. 
            <ul>
              <p>My son complains bitterly about what went on in Vrindavan. Of 
                course I have asked him a million times why he didn't tell me 
                what was going on. Because I used to go and visit him every year. 
                And he wouldn't say anything to me. He would just give me his 
                shopping list. When I asked him in retrospect why didn't you tell 
                me he just said, 'Because you wouldn't believe me.' . . . He assumed 
                I wouldn't believe him. And he assumed his letters would be censured. 
                And so he never wrote anything that would cause him to be censured. 
                (Interview 1997)<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#27">27</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> In still other instances the administration of the school in Vrindavan 
              apparently sought to hide the abuse taking place there during the 
              early 1980s. 
            <ul>
              <p>He [Headmaster] knowingly covered-up . . . There are two or three 
                incidents that I can think of where I was beaten or something 
                happened to me. He would take me into his room and he'd lock me 
                in there for like a day with him and he was like constantly preaching 
                to me and so finally I just went 'Okay! I won't say anything to 
                anybody. It didn't happen!' And he would let me out of the room. 
                (Interview 1993)<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#28">28</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>On final analysis it seems clear that the <i>gurukula</i> became 
              an institution unto itself, in Goffman's (1961) terms, a 'total 
              institution.' Within the <i>gurukula</i> children remained largely 
              separate from the day-to-day lives of their parents, and, very often, 
              from ISKCON community life more generally. From an institution meant 
              to train and educate, the <i>gurukula</i> instead became the functional 
              equivalent of an orphanage. As one teacher from this period remarked. 
            <ul>
              <p>The whole scenario set up an orphanage . . . Even though you 
                have kids with parents. Because we didn't allow the parents to 
                become part of their children's lives. (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p><i>Avoiding Child Abuse: Resources and Victimisation<br>
              </i>Although my focus thus far has sought to understand a number 
              of factors and processes that contributed to child abuse within 
              ISKCON's schools, I now want to consider why some young people did 
              not experience abuse and neglect. As I have already suggested, a 
              proportion of the students who attended the <i>gurukula</i> during 
              the 1970s and 1980s escaped being victims of child abuse. This happened 
              despite the fact that in some cases their classmates were targeted 
              for abuse, while they were spared. 
            <p>Perhaps the most obvious factor in whether a child was abused or 
              not, related to the school environment itself. It seems that some 
              <i>gurukulas</i> experienced far less child abuse, while others 
              were defined by neglect and abuse. To a significant degree, where 
              a student was sent to <i>gurukula</i> had a profound influence on 
              whether he or she became targets of abuse. Perhaps the most vivid 
              example is provided by the schools in India, where abuse and neglect 
              were, by all reports, commonplace. Since only adolescent boys were 
              sent to the schools in India they faced far more abuse than their 
              female counterparts. In the United States several of ISKCON's schools 
              also experienced relatively high levels of child abuse (for example, 
              Dallas, Seattle, New Vrindaban), whereas others experienced considerably 
              less (for example, Bhaktivedanta Village, California; New Talavan, 
              Mississippi). It appears also that child abuse was far less prevalent 
              in Europe and Australia than in either India or North America. 
            <p>But what explains these differences? I think several things. First 
              some schools had a more stable <i>gurukula</i> staff-both academic 
              and <i>ashram</i> teachers, as well as the school's administration. 
              While teachers in these schools may have been more devoted to working 
              in the <i>gurukula,</i> they also were able to establish enduring 
              and caring relationships with the children they worked with. Two 
              former <i>gurukula</i> students suggest why a particular school 
              proved especially positive for them in ways that highlight the role 
              of the teacher.

              <p>It was M[other] Kutila who changed our lives and who let us know 
                that someone could love us; that devotees <i>did</i> love one 
                another. I swear for the first week I thought I was a princess. 
                We were never hit any more, we had all new clothes, our own bags, 
                filled with our own soap, brushes and hot water showers. It was 
                then that I knew I had a mother and father, they were Kutila and 
                Kuladri (her husband). (Author's emphasis; Devi Dasi, K. 1990:1). 
              <p>One of the high points of my life in <i>gurukula</i> was because 
                the teacher, (name), took us in as his sons (original Vedic standard) 
                and treated us like adults. We had incredible camaraderie as well 
                as growth-including fitness, mental strength, creativity and Krishna 
                Consciousness. (Second Generation Survey 1992-93) 
            </ul>
            <p>A second factor that played an especially important role in limiting 
              the possibility of abuse had to do with the level of parental involvement 
              in the <i>gurukula.</i> While the leadership and the <i>gurukula</i> 
              staff each pressured against parental involvement, some parents 
              found ways to remain involved nonetheless. In some cases this was 
              made easier as parents resided in the same community as their child/children's 
              <i>gurukula.</i> In other cases parents wrote letters, made phone 
              calls, and visited their child or children on a regular basis. 
            <p>The sad irony is that parents who accepted the ideological justifications 
              offered by the leadership and chose to remain 'detached' and minimally 
              involved in the lives of their children, effectively left them vulnerable 
              to neglect and abuse. Simply put, children without involved parents 
              became ready victims for abusers. As one second generation devotee 
              concluded. 
            <ul>
              <p>Usually, if our parents showed an interest in us, by sending 
                us mail and gifts, visiting us, and maintaining a tight bond, 
                the abusive teachers would view that child as a liability to them. 
                (Hickey and Charnell, 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>To assure regular involvement with their children, some parents-especially 
              mothers-chose to work in the <i>gurukula</i> as teachers. As the 
              Headmaster of one school commented, 'Practically every teacher had 
              their children in the school. And that was an important factor [limiting 
              the potential for abuse] that those parents' eyes were there. It 
              was important.' As this suggests, the presence of parents working 
              in the <i>gurukula</i> served to protect all children against abuse, 
              not simply the child of the teacher. Because mothers were much more 
              likely than fathers to have a position in the <i>gurukula,</i> girls 
              more so than boys gained parental protection against abuse. As one 
              woman teacher recounts: 
            <ul>
              <p>With my daughter it was a little different because I had some 
                ability and determination to keep my daughters with me. So I was 
                a teacher and I taught my daughters, or at least I knew where 
                my daughters were being taught. But with my son it wasn't allowed. 
                He had to be removed from my presence. (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>A child also gained protection against abuse if he or she had a 
              male parent who was an ISKCON leader, or was otherwise recognised 
              as important and influential within the movement. For an abuser, 
              these children presented substantial risks and thereby were less 
              likely to be targeted. Even in India, where abuse was more commonplace, 
              children with influential fathers normally escaped being targets 
              of abuse. As one mother whose son spent years at a <i>gurukula</i> 
              in India reported. 
            <ul>
              <p>My son tells me that he didn't get abused. And it's funny isn't 
                it in light of his [activism over the abuse issue]. But this is 
                because of who his father was [a member of the GBC].<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#29">29</a> 
                (Interview 1997) 
            </ul>
            <p>For children whose parents remained largely uninvolved in their 
              lives, there was one available means to create a protective resource 
              against abuse. Again, India was the context. Apparently adolescent 
              boys in the <i>gurukula</i> were less subject to abuse if they received 
              initiation from one of ISKCON's <i>gurus.</i> In effect, initiation 
              created an interested and powerful ally who could expose or punish 
              an abuser. Initiation thus served as a means to create an interested 
              party in the absence of involved and/or influential parents. 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>Marriage and family life have played a central role in the development 
              of religious communities and institutions (Berger 1969:133; Dobbelaere 
              1987; Foster 1991; Kanter 1972:86-92, 1973). Kanter's investigation 
              of 19th century American communities demonstrated that successful 
              utopian communities-religious and secular-controlled or otherwise 
              regulated two-person intimacy and family relationships. Only by 
              renouncing couple and family relationships could intimacy become 
              a collective good serving the interests of the community as a whole. 
              As such, utopian communities face the task of building and maintaining 
              relational structures 'which do not compete with the community for 
              emotional fulfilment' (Kanter 1972:91). 
            <p>Beginning in the 1970s ISKCON sought increasingly to control marriage 
              and family life. This involved several processes: First, marriage 
              itself was redefined such that it became symbolic of spiritual weakness, 
              an institution suited only for those unable to control their sexual 
              desires. Secondly, in order to educate children separate from their 
              parents, Prabhupada established the <i>gurukula.</i> While founded 
              initially as an educational institution, the <i>gurukula</i> also 
              freed parents to work full-time on behalf of ISKCON and its communities. 
              For many parents this involved performing <i>sankirtan</i>.<a href="6_1rochfordfoot.html#30">30</a> 
            <p>In important respects <i>sankirtan</i> and children represent interrelated 
              and pivotal issues in ISKCON's North American and world-wide development. 
              To ISKCON's largely <i>sannyasi</i> leadership, <i>sankirtan</i> 
              represented the means by which the movement could fulfil its missionary 
              objectives. It served too, to bring substantial resources into ISKCON's 
              communities during the 1970s (Rochford 1985:171-89). Children, on 
              the other hand, represented a potential threat to each of these 
              objectives. With a decline in recruitment beginning as early as 
              1974 in North America (Rochford 1985:278), ISKCON leaned ever harder 
              on householders to perform <i>sankirtan.</i> The result was the 
              purpose of the <i>gurukula </i> organisationally came to rest on 
              its ability to provide childcare. Unfortunately, as I have described, 
              the <i>gurukula</i> became an institution defined by neglect and 
              the abuse of children. 
            <p>Prior to widespread allegations of child abuse, ISKCON represented 
              what Shupe (1995) refers to as a 'trusted hierarchy.' Religious 
              groups and organisations are distinct from their secular counterparts 
              precisely because 'those occupying lower statuses in religious organisations 
              trust or believe in the good intentions, nonselfish motives, benevolence, 
              and spiritual insights/wisdom of those in the upper echelons (and 
              often are encouraged or admonished to do so)' (italics in the original, 
              Shupe 1995:29). Indeed parents often socialise their children to 
              respect the religious authority of church leaders, thus perpetuating 
              the very basis of trust within religious organisations. It was such 
              unquestioned trust in the leadership, and in ISKCON as a whole, 
              that led parents to readily assume that their children were being 
              properly educated and cared for in the <i>gurukula.</i> As we have 
              seen, this very assumption helped create opportunity structures 
              facilitating abuse and exploitation (see Krebs 1998; Shupe 1995 
              for other examples). 
            <p>As one might expect, child abuse affects far more people than those 
              directly victimised. As Pullen suggests 'religious congregations 
              can collectively share psychological, emotional, and spiritual trauma 
              when faced with the reality that their most vulnerable members have 
              been sexually violated by individuals the community invested with 
              authority' (1998:68). Among members of a support group formed in 
              response to clerical sexual abuse of children in California, Pullen 
              found members making reference to their own 'spiritual abuse.' Although 
              not directly abused themselves, group members nonetheless expressed 
              'that their trust and faith in the credibility and integrity of 
              their religious leaders had been shattered' (1998:68-9). Nason-Clark 
              (1998) found much the same response among female congregants in 
              the aftermath of child sexual abuse by Church officials in Canada. 
              In organisational terms, child abuse and malfeasance by clergy precipitates 
              a crisis of trust among rank and file members. As Seligman argues 
              the 'existence of trust is an essential component of all enduring 
              social relationships' (1997:13) and is indeed necessary for the 
              continuation of any social order. 
            <p>The betrayal of trust represented by child abuse has challenged, 
              if not undermined, the ISKCON commitment of many first and second 
              generation members alike. Child abuse stands as a powerful symbol 
              of the failure of ISKCON's leadership, and that form of social organisation 
              (that is, communalism) which supported its political and spiritual 
              authority. As trust gave way to anger and doubt, householders became 
              less willing to commit their lives to ISKCON as they had in the 
              past. Needless to say, many second generation devotees also rejected 
              their ISKCON collective identity. This fact, perhaps more than any 
              other, accounts for the fragmentation and decline of ISKCON in North 
              America. (But see Rochford 1997 for another interpretation). In 
              failing to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the movement's 
              most vulnerable members, ISKCON faced being discredited from within, 
              and a corresponding loss of legitimacy in the eyes of many long-time 
              members. Many abandoned ISKCON, while others joined an emerging 
              congregation of independent householders and their families residing 
              on the margins of ISKCON's North American communities. As this implies, 
              the tragedy of child abuse has shaped, and continues to shape, the 
              career of ISKCON as a religious organisation newly arrived on the 
              North American Scene.
