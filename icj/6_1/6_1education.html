            <p>In his article, Rasamandala dasa explores whether ISKCON education 
              can benefit from theories and practices common in secular education, 
              whether these are compatible with the principles of Vedic scripture, 
              points out some weaknesses in current ISKCON practice and recommends 
              some ways forward for the future. It is obviously the product of 
              much reflection and considerable first hand experiences. It is my 
              opinion that the most valuable progress in educational fields comes 
              from those who have daily experience of the teaching and learning 
              process and therefore know what works and what does not. This is 
              an opinion shared by those who advocate 'action research' by practising 
              educationalists (see Hitchcock and Hughes 1995). I also feel that 
              it is a sign of maturity in a religious community to be able to 
              be self-critical in this way, and Rasamandala dasa is to be commended 
              for seeking to lead ISKCON into a new phase of development. 
            <p>I would further like to explore issues of the methods of secular 
              education, the importance of clarity about aims, objectives, content, 
              methods, and assessment, the way in which other religious communities 
              are facing these issues, and finally to suggest that religious communities 
              and secular education should be 'critical friends' of one another. 
            <p><i>Secular education and experiential learning<br>
              </i>Rasamandala dasa, perhaps, gives an oversimplified picture of 
              'modem secular education' in that this is a very contested area, 
              not helped by the polarisation into 'progressive' versus 'traditional' 
              teachers, neither of which exist outside newspaper articles. However, 
              the stress on skills and attitudes, the pupil as an active learner 
              constructing knowledge from experiential learning and the teacher 
              as facilitator rather than fount of knowledge, are common themes. 
              This is partly because ideas about knowledge have changed and it 
              is now seen as contested and provisional, rather than a fixed entity, 
              with the teacher's only problem being how to transmit it. It is 
              also because learning technology has changed. Traditional (for example, 
              Vedic) learning took place in a context where the only resource 
              was the teacher. We now have a wealth of resources- books, videos, 
              interactive CD-ROMs-which means that the learner can be more independent 
              of the teacher. I think both these issues need to be faced when 
              exploring changes in educational methods. Yet even thousands of 
              years ago, without these resources, good teachers knew that you 
              cannot just tell people things, they have to be enabled to understand 
              them for themselves. One thinks of the Buddha, who sent Kisagotami 
              out to find a mustard seed from a house where no-one had ever died, 
              or Uddalaka Aruni in the <i>Chandogya Upanisad</i> who had his son 
              Svetaketu dissolve salt in water so that he could experience for 
              himself the truth that the invisible can nonetheless be present 
              everywhere. Thus, experiential learning is not a modern invention. 
              I was fascinated but not surprised to see that concepts such as 
              knowledge, skills and values had parallels in Vedic literature. 
            <p><i> Aims, objectives, content, method and assessment<br>
              </i>One of the things I have learned from my own experience is the 
              importance of clear aims and objectives (the latest jargon here 
              is 'learning outcomes'), separating content and method, as well 
              as assessment and evaluation to determine whether the planned learning 
              actually took place. New teachers, as Rasamandala dasa states, usually 
              focus on content and possibly method, but often ignore aims. I have 
              so often supervised the lessons of student teachers, with the question 
              'so what?' in my mind, and sadly also that of the pupils. Or student 
              teachers will have grandiose aims such as creating harmony between 
              religions, and then feel it has been achieved when at the end of 
              the lesson their pupils are able to label the parts of a mosque. 
              Thus, I applaud Rasamandala dasa for this emphasis. 
            <p>One area where my experience has differed from Rasamandala's is 
              that I would not necessarily agree that teacher directed knowledge 
              input comes first and student-centred exploration second. In secular 
              education it has almost become the other way round, with pupils 
              in nursery classes encouraged to make their own choices and pupils 
              in secondary school exam classes cramming by rote. I would claim 
              that it should be a dialectical relationship between the two styles. 
              Some topics lend themselves to starting with teacher input, and 
              others to starting with pupil exploration of experience. 
            <p>Another area that I have had reason to reflect on is the relationship 
              between aims, content and methods. My own secular teacher training 
              students often confuse the three, considering that a confessional 
              aim must have a narrow content and traditional, didactic methods. 
              Confessional teaching can employ experiential and exciting methods, 
              and non-confessional teaching can be delivered in a <i>dull</i> 
              and doctrinaire fashion. Of course, there are also times when methods 
              can contradict aims, such as a lesson on democracy taught in a dictatorial 
              fashion. I would support the idea that experiential methods need 
              not conflict with the confessional aims of ISKCON. 
            <p><i>Knowledge, concepts, skills and attitudes<br>
              </i>As a young teacher, like my own students mentioned above, my 
              main focus was on knowledge-I wanted to share my enthusiasm about 
              religions by sharing my collection of facts with pupils. However, 
              experience has taught me that interesting as facts may be, far more 
              important is the acquisition of general concepts which can be applied 
              to new situations, skills which can likewise be transferable to 
              new contexts and, most of all, the inculcation of attitudes such 
              as curiosity and respect for the opinions of others, which will 
              outlast any facts remembered. In other words, the teacher helps 
              the pupil develop the abilities needed to continue learning long 
              after the teacher has departed; as the saying goes, rather than 
              giving the hungry person fish, you teach that person how to fish. 
              Thus, I would agree with Rasamandala dasa that attitudes and values 
              should take priority of place in education, but suggest he might 
              like to add 'concepts' to his list of knowledge, attitudes and skills. 
            <p><i>The experience of other faith communities<br>
              </i>Problems with education in a confessional context are not unique 
              to ISKCON, and are indeed shared by other faith communities. In 
              this country, there is in particular a wealth of experience in Christian 
              education (see for example, Astley and Francis 1996, Francis and 
              Thatcher 1990, Astley and Day 1992). Many contemporary writers (such 
              as Capaldi, in Francis and Thatcher) are realising that Christian 
              education cannot be a passive induction into a static tradition, 
              but rooted in the concerns and experience of the pupils and in the 
              realisation that those traditions themselves grow and change. Jeff 
              Astley sensibly concludes that a balanced Christian education privileges 
              neither the pupils' experience nor the teachings of the tradition, 
              but is a dialectic where each criticises the other (Astley and Day). 
              Thus my suggestion to ISKCON is that it may well be worth studying 
              how other faith traditions are dealing with educational issues. 
            <p><i>Secular education and religious communities: critical friends?<br>
              </i> In educational research circles the notion of a 'critical friend' 
              has taken root-someone who will point out your errors and make suggestions, 
              but as a supportive equal. Thus I would suggest like Rasamandala 
              dasa that confessional education can learn a lot from secular education, 
              especially in the area of actual practical teaching strategies that 
              work. On the other hand, confessional education can also offer something 
              to secular education, in that it can query the often unexamined 
              presuppositions underlying what goes on in contemporary schools. 
            <p>It has to be admitted that in secular education there are certain 
              tendencies that might seem to be in tension with education as traditionally 
              found in religious communities. Modern secular education tends to 
              be underpinned with liberal humanist values which may stress individual 
              autonomy rather than 'submission', reject scriptural revelation 
              and personal spiritual experience as valid sources of knowledge, 
              and separate the intellectual from the personal, moral and spiritual. 
              This does not mean that confessional and secular education need 
              be enemies: secular education can through its questioning help to 
              prevent religious communities becoming fossilised by over-stressing 
              their claims to absolute knowledge, and religious communities can 
              confront the implicit relativism of secular education with important 
              questions of truth. One of the most valuable challenges to modern 
              Western philosophy from Hindu philosophy is the age old idea that 
              wisdom is shown by moral behaviour, as well as clever ideas. As 
              Radhakrishnan (1950) put it 'A man is not learned simply because 
              he talks much. He who is tranquil, free of hatred, free from fear, 
              he is said to be learned' (in Morgan and Lawson 1996:63).

            <p align="left">I would like to offer comments on Rasamandala dasa's 
              article 'Towards Principles and Values-An Analysis of Education 
              Philosophy and Practice within ISKCON' in the last issue of the 
              journal (Vol. 5, No. 2). I do so as the Publications Director of 
              the Christian Education Movement, an educational charity firmly 
              rooted in the Christian tradition, but committed to the teaching 
              of the major world faiths as part of the religious education programme 
              in schools. 
            <p>There are clearly some elements in Rasamandala dasa's article on 
              which I am not qualified to pass any opinion. I cannot comment on 
              how far it is possible to reconcile twentieth century educational 
              philosophies with Vedic texts, or the ways in which ISKCON, as an 
              organisation, ought to develop. Having said that, I found the article 
              fascinating because so much of what Rasamandala dasa had to say 
              connected with my own experience and my own thinking, both as a 
              religious educator in the secular education system, and as a member 
              of my own faith community leading a Bible course for adults. 
            <p>The first point with which I identify strongly is the current domination 
              of knowledge-based teaching. Of course, no one in their right senses 
              can deny the importance of knowledge, but knowledge is not an end 
              in itself. It is what you <i>do</i> with knowledge that matters. 
              In schools, religious education is just emerging from a long period 
              in which the transmission of knowledge was totally dominant. There 
              were good reasons for this. When it became apparent in the late 
              1960s and early 1970s that a religious education that focused exclusively 
              on Christianity could not be educationally justified within a secular 
              school system, it was replaced by the phenomenological approach. 
              Put in very crude terms the philosophy behind this ran as follows. 
              Whatever your own faith or non-faith stance, it is undeniable that 
              religion has been vastly influential in the way human beings have 
              lived their lives. Therefore, an education that does not attend 
              to this phenomenon is incomplete. However, because it is not part 
              of a secular education system to indoctrinate or convert pupils, 
              we must confine ourselves to teaching the 'facts'. 
            <p>The legacy of this phase of religious education is still very strong 
              and is reflected in heavily content-laden agreed syllabuses of religious 
              education, but there are signs nevertheless, that changes are on 
              their way. The <i>Model Syllabuses for Religious Education</i> produced 
              by the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) in 1994 
              refer to two types of learning: learning <i>about</i> religions 
              and learning <i>from</i> religions. Thus, a pupil is no longer considered 
              to be religiously educated who merely knows a lot of facts about 
              different religions. Pupils are expected to '<i>respond</i> to questions 
              of meaning within religions' (my italics). Elsewhere the Model Syllabuses 
              state that, 'Religious education should help pupils to . . . enhance 
              their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development . . .' In 
              short, while religious education as set out in the Model Syllabuses 
              is not intended to indoctrinate or convert pupils, it <i>is</i> 
              intended to change them. In other words, it <i>is</i> to do with 
              <i>being</i> as well as <i>knowing.</i> 
            <p>Here too I identify with Rasamandala dasa. Education in religion 
              (whether religion in general or a specific religion) is about being 
              and not just about knowing and doing. It is about what we are and 
              what we are to become as well as what we know and how we behave. 
              I thought as I read the earlier part of the article that Rasamandala 
              dasa was putting forward a sequential view of learning in which 
              knowledge comes first, to be followed by understanding, skills and 
              values. I was pleased to see that he subsequently opted for a model 
              that saw these as proceeding in parallel rather than sequentially, 
              which is certainly true to my experience. I am sometimes amazed 
              as I read the New Testament at how new believers seem to have been 
              baptised into the faith after the briefest of encounters with a 
              Christian evangelist. It seems that detailed instruction in the 
              faith only occurred <i>after</i> the initial commitment had been 
              made. 
            <p>The adults who come to my classes on the Bible have only partial 
              knowledge of the text in many cases, but their observations often 
              reveal a secure grasp of the basic principles of Christianity and 
              considerable insight into their application to the task of living 
              a Christian life. Above all, they are highly motivated. This echoes 
              the comment made in footnote 16 of Rasamandala dasa's article when 
              he observes from experience that a student with no skills but the 
              right attitude is far easier to teach than a student endowed with 
              technique alone. 
            <p>For these reasons I would not wish to put knowledge, understanding, 
              skills and values in a rigid learning sequence. I believe they interact 
              with one another and need to be developed in parallel. 
            <p>As a final comment, I am encouraged by Rasamandala dasa's emphasis 
              on principles and values because of the possibilities which these 
              open up for inter-faith discussion and co-operation. At the level 
              of principles and values, the major faiths have a great deal in 
              common. It is in specific forms of belief, and even more so in specific 
              practices, which often reflect the cultural origins of the faith, 
              that they appear to be so very different. To take a very obvious 
              example, all faiths appear to promote the so-called Golden Rule 
              in one form or another: 'Do to others as you would wish them to 
              do to you.' 
            <p>Hans Küng, the Swiss Roman Catholic theologian, has argued that 
              it is possible to speak of a 'global ethic' which reflects the ethical 
              concerns of the major world faiths. He has further argued that there 
              is little hope for a peaceful world unless the faiths recognise 
              and promote the values they share, which are often contrary to the 
              values of the secular world. In short, he argues that the differences 
              between the faiths are relatively small compared with the vast gulf 
              between a religious understanding and a secular understanding of 
              the world. 
            <p>This takes us back to the beginning: knowledge by itself is not 
              enough. It is certainly not enough if, in terms of religious education 
              in schools, it only teaches children that different faiths have 
              <i>different</i> holy books, <i>different</i> places of worship, 
              <i>different</i> times of prayer, <i>different</i> forms of dress, 
              <i>different</i> festivals and so on. They need to know that people 
              of different faiths often live by the <i>same,</i> or <i>similar,</i> 
              principles and values. And they need to be challenged to consider 
              whether they should not adopt these values for themselves.

            <p>&nbsp;Having read and digested what Rasamandala dasa has to say, 
              I must admit to having great sympathy with his argument for a systematic 
              approach towards training and education if ISKCON is to progress 
              successfully into its 'third phase'. His choice of an experiential 
              approach to teaching is not one upon which I would base an entire 
              approach to teaching, preferring a mixture of methods. 
            <p>My own experience is with Key Stage 2 and 3 Religious Education 
              (RE) in British schools. School RE is, though, somewhat different 
              as it must, by law be non-denominational and it cannot advocate 
              the truth or otherwise of one particular faith. However, for the 
              purpose of a faith group, Rasamandala dasa's choice of an experiential 
              approach does have advantages. 
            <p>Informed choice is essential to any decision-making process. Choosing 
              to be a devotee of an ideological group should be no exception. 
              Rasamandala dasa demonstrates that this is not at odds with ISKCON's 
              tenets by citing from the eighteenth chapter of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              in support of his argument. In my view, a further advantage to his 
              approach is that an overt educational process, which is capable 
              of standing up to scrutiny externally as well as internally, would 
              doubtless disabuse concerns about ISKCON's intentions, that is, 
              'brainwashing' or coercion of devotees.<a href="#1">1</a> This can 
              only assist in raising public awareness of ISKCON as a reputable 
              and discerning group, as indeed would his idea of appropriate advertising 
              materials. This is an area deserving greater debate. However, I 
              intend to turn to another feature of his article. 
            <p>Rasamandala dasa writes of the striking resemblance between secular 
              management and the education processes, albeit acknowledging the 
              different aims of each; secular management aims to achieve financial 
              gain whilst education as applied to groups such as ISKCON is intended 
              to develop greater spiritual awareness. He states, 'For this reason, 
              the managerial function must serve the education processes, rather 
              than vice versa'<a href="#2">2</a>. His ideal is that temples should 
              be centres for education. He rightly recognises that a haphazard 
              approach to education, no matter how well a particular teaching 
              method may work in itself, is not acceptable. Indeed it would be 
              doomed to failure, as it would fail to address many of the issues 
              which it is intended to correct. His proposal is a clear management 
              system within which the education processes can function, and one 
              which is easily understood by devotees. 
            <p>As a one time personnel executive in a national supermarket chain, 
              I was responsible for ensuring that training and education were 
              properly implemented within stores. Where failures occurred in stores, 
              it was one of my responsibilities to investigate why. What Rasamandala 
              dasa points out as some of the problems within ISKCON: confusion 
              surrounding personal and institutional responsibilities; negative 
              motivational tactics; failures of communication etc. could also 
              be found in problem stores. The common reason for this failure was 
              non-adherence to recognised management systems and an 'I know best' 
              attitude from managers at various levels. The general effect on 
              staff in this situation was one of a sense of unfairness and demoralisation. 
              In stores which did work in accord with the system the difference 
              was tangible. All staff understood their role, were confident in 
              themselves and their own work. Moreover, such stores fulfilled their 
              purpose-in this case making a profit. To go back to 'failing' supermarkets, 
              in the main they still managed to function, but staff turnover was 
              exceptionally high. Locally the store would have a generally poor 
              reputation and ex-employees were often embittered at their experiences. 
            <p>It may seem inappropriate to draw such an analogy between failures 
              within ISKCON and secular approaches to management. After all, ISKCON 
              is not seeking to become a commercial enterprise. But as Rasamandala 
              dasa points out, a management function is a supporting factor. It 
              is the purpose to which a system is employed that is the determining 
              factor. Supermarkets, charities, educational institutions and religious 
              institutions may all use similar management systems, but have different 
              objectives. The fact that a secular management system is envisaged 
              as a support for ISKCON's educational programmes, as defined by 
              him, should not irk devotees; it is merely an expedient. The use 
              of a systematic approach to education within the group will result 
              in devotees confident in their own faith and able to grow in Krishna 
              consciousness, these are the fruits which Rasamandala dasa's approach 
              could potentially bring. 
            <p>In this 'third phase' of ISKCON's progression it is imperative 
              that this routinisation involves a positive and dynamic step forward. 
              'Short-termism' is a disastrous route. Rasamandala dasa's approach 
              is long-term, forward thinking and one which deserves the full backing 
              of the leadership. It is for them to decide whether they will take 
              this opportunity to realise ISKCON's full potential. For the sake 
              of all ISKCON devotees, current and future, I sincerely hope that 
              they do.
