            <p align=LEFT>Massimo Introvigne has argued in favour of the term 
              'religious minorities' being applied to contemporary religious groups 
              presently labelled as 'new religious movements' by scholars. It 
              is not entirely clear from his article whether he is urging this 
              course of action on his fellow academics, or onto the authorities 
              responsible for determining policies in Europe. Perhaps by encouraging 
              the first group to do so he is optimistic that others will take 
              up the new term. I would like to sum up the reasons why using a 
              new term may be desirable, but also draw attention to a few of the 
              difficulties which may lie ahead if the term 'religious minorities' 
              is adopted generally by academics. 
            <p>I will spend little time in pointing out the advantages, since 
              recently there has been considerable debate in both this journal 
              and others on the issue. In short, however, it is generally conceded, 
              as Massimo Introvigne has indicated in his paper, that the terms 
              that are in current use, 'sect', 'cult' and 'new religious movement' 
              are all problematic. 'Sect' and 'cult', formerly sociological terms 
              with technical meanings, have both been appropriated for political 
              ends by the 'anti-cult' movement in Europe and elsewhere. Although 
              some of my colleagues, notably Dr Michael York at Bath Spa University 
              College, have advocated re-appropriating these terms, the general 
              feeling is that the battle has been lost. For this reason, most 
              well-intentioned scholars use the term 'new religious movement'. 
              However, this too, has its difficulties. Firstly, as Massimo Introvigne 
              states, it has taken on many of the negative associations of the 
              other two terms. Secondly, many members of groups put into this 
              category do not recognise themselves when it is used about them. 
              Some, such as ISKCON devotees, do not consider themselves as 'new'. 
              Others, such as followers of Sathya Sai Baba, and the Brahma Kumaris, 
              describe themselves as 'spiritual' rather than 'religious'. Thirdly, 
              it is unclear at what point a 'new religious movement' becomes an 
              'old religious movement'. Is it when the founder dies? Or when records 
              start to be kept? Or when a second and third generation is established, 
              and controversy is a thing of the past? Or when new 'new religious 
              movements' begin to appear? 
            <p>Most academics, therefore, are receptive to any new suggestions 
              to get us out of this quandary. However, it is right that we should 
              consider these carefully, making sure that we do not jump from the 
              frying pan into the fire. Taking on the role of devil's advocate 
              for a moment, let me start by querying Massimo Introvigne's argument 
              that the term 'religious minority' is the most neutral term available. 
              Somewhat pedantically, perhaps, I would put it to him that words 
              are rarely, if ever, neutral commodities. 'Religious minority' sends 
              out its own loaded message into the public arena. However, I would 
              agree that at present, in Europe, its associations are not those 
              of 'brainwashing', exploitation and abuse, and that in this sense 
              its message is applicable to contemporary movements and is one which 
              academics can support. We should not forget, though, that some groups 
              now labelled as 'religious minorities' in Europe, especially Islamic 
              communities, still experience themselves as threatened, marginalised 
              and vulnerable. Thus, being called a 'religious minority' may not 
              necessarily place those previously labelled as 'sects', 'cults' 
              and 'new religious movements' in a more comfortable position in 
              relation to the mainstream. 
            <p>I would point to a further possible drawback. This is, that since 
              the meanings of terms are never definitively fixed, pejorative connotations 
              may be taken from the term 'new religious movement' and applied 
              to 'religious minority'. This occurred in the past between the terms 
              'sect', 'cult' and 'new religious movement'; it may be that the 
              terms 'religious minority' and 'new religious movement' will increasingly 
              be used interchangeably. In this sense, we will be back to where 
              we started. Arguably, however, we will not even be in the same situation 
              as before, as more groups than those under attack today will have 
              been added to the hit list for anti-cult groups. This is not simply 
              a hypothetical future, given the rise of intolerance towards racial, 
              ethnic and religious minorities in Europe today. Thus, we should 
              think through the potential consequences for all these different 
              communities very seriously before deciding on what our policy should 
              be. 
            <p>Two other problems that are evident now will be seen by some to 
              be of less significance, since neither really have repercussions 
              in the wider public arena. Arguably, however, both are of importance 
              to their respective constituencies, and should be included in the 
              debate. The first is that the term 'religious minority' may be felt 
              to be no more representative to members of some contemporary groups 
              than the term 'new religious movement'. As far as ISKCON devotees 
              are concerned, the term has the advantage of not including the word 
              'new'. For them, therefore, it seems more accurate. However, for 
              those groups who think of themselves as 'spiritual' rather than 
              'religious', or even neither, replacing the old label with that 
              of 'religious minority' does not seem to take them very far forward. 
              Indeed, they may not recognise themselves at all in the new term, 
              as they may not experience themselves as a 'minority', despite having 
              a comparatively small membership. 
            <p>The second is that, for sociologists of religion such as Dr Introvigne 
              and Professor Eileen Barker who coined the term 'new religious movement', 
              the argument can be made that this term <i>does</i> actually have 
              its uses. I am happy to agree that many groups defined in this way, 
              such as ISKCON, have their roots in older traditions. From this 
              perspective, the term 'new' does not apply. However, some other 
              contemporary movements, also the butts of undeserved hostility, 
              <i>do</i> represent themselves as new. Indeed, it is this newness 
              which allows them to offer new hope to humanity. Moreover, sociologically 
              speaking, ISKCON can be seen in some respects to be new in the early 
              years after Prabhupada's arrival in the USA. It certainly seemed 
              new to most Westerners in the late 1960s, and it initially attracted 
              converts in the West who at the time had no experience or formal 
              understanding of the Vaishnavite tradition. Early <i>ashram</i> 
              life, furthermore, seems to have had many of the characteristics 
              which sociologists associate with new religion, such as common ownership, 
              relationships based on personal trust rather than on institutional 
              regulation, and a high turnover of members. 
            <p>Of course, I can see the reasons why devotees dislike the label 
              'new religious movement' today. These include the fact that it places 
              them in a category with groups with which they feel they have nothing 
              in common, leaves them exposed to unjustified accusations of 'brainwashing'; 
              it does not reflect ISKCON's support by the Gujarati community as 
              an exemplar of a major South Asian tradition and it does not resonate 
              with the deep understanding of Vaishnavism now evinced by many devotees. 
              Nevertheless, these considerations are, a sociologist might argue, 
              because we are thirty years on, rather than because ISKCON has never 
              been new in any sense whatsoever. But I should emphasise that I 
              appreciate that this is a technical argument and one, that I am 
              sure, will hold little appeal for devotees in the present climate 
              of intolerance, where some are having to face bigotry on a daily 
              basis. 
            <p>In the final analysis, it is the last consideration that should 
              and, I believe, will prevail with my academic colleagues, many of 
              whom have dedicated themselves to upholding the values of tolerance, 
              liberty, and freedom of choice. If there is anything we can do to 
              ensure that people are not subject to unjust discrimination, I am 
              certain that we will try to do it. For this reason, I am very grateful 
              to Massimo Introvigne for initiating the present debate, and I very 
              much hope that this discussion will have a positive outcome. Before 
              we make a concerted move, however, we should engage in dialogue 
              with as many of the people involved as possible, in order to be 
              convinced that any change is useful, and likely to lead to greater, 
              rather than lesser, tolerance for all concerned. Furthermore, perhaps 
              we sociologists should begin to question more closely the values 
              and assumptions implicit in the ways in which we seek to represent 
              others.
