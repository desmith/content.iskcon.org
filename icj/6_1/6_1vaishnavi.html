            <p align=left><b class="maintextsubhead">Editor: Steven J. Rosen<br>
              Publisher: Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1996</b> 
            <p>This book presents a major contribution to research on women in 
              Hinduism and in particular on women's status, roles and accomplishments 
              in Vaishnavism. The work succeeds in demonstrating that women in 
              Vaishnavism have a relatively high status on account of the scriptures 
              on which the religion is based, and because of the doctrinal tenets 
              that consider feminine devotion the ideal form of worship. 
            <p>Though not all the Vaishnavis discussed in this work are worshippers 
              of Krishna, they are all <i>bhaktas</i> (devotees) and have in common 
              a single-minded, tenacious devotion to, and love for, their God. 
              Refusing to be a victim in oppressive and untoward situations, each 
              of these Vaishnavis asserts her individuality and musters the courage 
              and determination to follow her conscience. Each of them has charisma 
              and spiritual depth; each is in some way a leader. By desiring communion 
              with the Transcendent, they all have become transmitters and shapers 
              of tradition, as well as role models who may help Vaishnavas today 
              (and indeed, members of other religious traditions) to appropriate 
              their spiritual legacy and enlarge the vision of their religion. 
            <p>To show that Vaishnavis have been an influential force in religious 
              thought and to demonstrate the choices and possibilities open to 
              them, Steven Rosen has brought out a collection of nine stimulating 
              and thought-provoking essays by recognised scholars, poets and essayists 
              in the field. Most of the articles have previously been published 
              in the <i>Journal of Vaishnava Studies</i> and will now, hopefully, 
              gain greater exposure in university and public libraries. 
            <p>In her thoroughly-researched and lucidly-written contribution, 
              Nancy Martin explores the religious choices available to women in 
              Vaishnavism by first focusing on the life of a sixteenth century 
              saint named Mirabai, and then discussing four twentieth-century 
              women who consciously follow her example. Martin points out their 
              commonalities and shows how these modern-day Miras have been influenced 
              by their sixteenth-century predecessor. She persuasively argues 
              that Mira gives today's bhaktas as individuals, and as communities, 
              the possibility to develop personally and spiritually. 
            <p>Andrew Schelling, himself a poet and a translator of note, seeks 
              to counter the hagiographical information on Mirabai by placing 
              her life in a socio-historical context, and by interpreting factual 
              and legendary materials about her from a non-religious perspective. 
              Schelling's excellent translation and interpretation of Mirabai's 
              poetry is characterised by deep empathy and a rare gift for understanding 
              her lyrical visions. The reader, confronted with a woman of such 
              passion and obstinate individualism, cannot but long to know more 
              about her as a human being. As a poet, according to Schelling, she 
              will be immortalised first and foremost on account of her wild passion 
              that reflects aspects of primal religion. 
            <p>The following essay, a very carefully researched scholarly contribution 
              by Jan Brzezinski, describes the life and achievements of a number 
              of women saints in the Caitanya Gaudiya tradition. Dividing the 
              movement's history into three periods, early, middle and modern, 
              Brzezinski comes to the conclusion that female followers' status 
              was the highest in the middle period, the time shortly after Caitanya's 
              death. In those days, female devotees had the opportunity to take 
              on important roles of leadership and to participate in the propagation 
              of the religion. Brzezinski argues that, though women in Gaudiya 
              Vaishnavism were considered inferior to men early on in Vaishnava 
              History (seen more as obstacles to the latter's soteriological endeavours), 
              there is no overt misogynism in the Caitanya Movement. He is right 
              in pointing out that the women whose lives he has researched deserve 
              more critical attention than has previously been accorded them. 
            <p>Steven J. Rosen focuses on Gaudiya Vaishnavism, explaining in a 
              valuable, detailed discussion one of its most confidential, and 
              in a sense controversial teachings: raganuga bhakti. Caitanya is 
              said to have come into this world and to have introduced this passionate 
              form of devotion, in order to help followers to re-establish their 
              lost relationship with God. Yet many devotees have denigrated the 
              practice, partly because it is esoteric and highly advanced. As 
              Rosen points out, it is meant to bring out the inner woman in Gaudiya 
              Vaishnava <i>sadhana</i> (spiritual practice). He further discusses 
              the concept of <i>Manjari-bhava,</i> another esoteric revelation, 
              considered Caitanya's major legacy. This stimulating contribution 
              should be of special interest to Caitanya devotees. 
            <p>In the following article, Mary McGee describes with great insight 
              and empathy the life and conflicts of Bahinabai, a seventeenth-century 
              <i>bhakta.</i> This Vaishnavi's profound spirituality and devotion 
              helped her to endure her husband's almost intolerable abusiveness, 
              and to reconcile her role as a wife and mother with her desire to 
              dedicate herself totally to her God. Exploring Bahinabai's autobiography, 
              the most unique among her hymns, McGee convincingly argues that 
              Bahinabai adopted a philosophy of living in the world without really 
              being part of it, and persuasively contends that the latter represents 
              an example of how the conflict between <i>stridharma</i><a href="#1">1</a> 
              and devotional life could be solved. 
            <p>Dennis Hudson's article is a welcome extension of his publication 
              'Antal Alvar: A Developing Hagiography' that can be found in the 
              <i>Journal of Vaishnava Studies</i>. By placing Antal in a socio-historical 
              context, he portrays her as a human being rather than a mystified 
              saint and focuses on her exceptional poetic gifts. 
            <p>In a very detailed and perceptive analysis Hudson builds up a helpful 
              series of metaphors and motifs in her work and interprets their 
              implications. He persuasively demonstrates that Antal tried to establish 
              a link between the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and her own collection of 
              poetry. His incisive discussion of Antal's work gives readers a 
              new sense of the importance of her achievement. 
            <p>Another Antal comes to life in Nancy Ann Nayar's essay. In a balanced, 
              authoritative account she presents information about this twelfth-century 
              Srivaishnava woman who, in accordance with the tenets of her religion 
              and on account of her positive marital relationship, managed to 
              reconcile her devotional life with the precepts of stridharma. Nayar 
              perceptively analyses the rather scanty factual information about 
              Antal and argues that the latter was mentioned in the male dominated 
              hagiographical texts not only because she was the wife and mother 
              of two prominent Srivaishnavas, but because of her own strength 
              of character. 
            <p>Katherine Young's contribution is a piece of exemplary scholarship. 
              Her familiarity with the Tamil language, her careful study of the 
              socio-historical context in which the theology of Srivaishnavism 
              developed, coupled with astute interpretational skill rewards the 
              reader with many new and valuable insights. Young illustrates the 
              reasons for the difference between conservative Brahmanism and Srivaishnavism 
              and analyses the acaryas' (the main spiritual leaders) motives for 
              their support of women. She comes to the conclusion that especially 
              the Tenkalai heritage may provide the basis for a universal theology 
              that focuses on contemporary women's issues. 
            <p>Kim Knott's clearly written, carefully researched and critically 
              valuable investigation sheds some light on the status and function 
              of women in the Hare Krishna Movement. She argues convincingly that 
              in order to learn about women's position in ISKCON, one has to look 
              at the status of men. Adducing information regarding the views of 
              members as well as those of sociologists who look at the movement 
              from an outsider's perspective, Knott infers that, though women 
              are considered equal spiritually, male and female devotees still 
              have not gained complete material equality. For years, members have 
              struggled to reconcile the values of tradition with the demands 
              of present-day reality. However, Knott rightly points out that neither 
              the scriptures, nor the philosophy of ISKCON, nor the founder's 
              own writings provide an obstacle to women achieving total equality 
              with men. It is encouraging that male and female devotees are now 
              working together to overcome the problems that women faced in the 
              movement during the 1970s. At that time, some <i>sannyasis</i> had 
              actually tried to prevent women from being initiated into the religion. 
              Fortunately, female members of ISKCON are becoming more self-assured 
              and actively dare to define their role in the movement. 
            <p>Rosen's collection will certainly provide an incentive for future 
              scholarship, and critical readers, and those wishing to begin to 
              investigate the field, will have a valuable guidebook to accompany 
              them.

              <li><a name="1"></a>Formally women were excluded from the system 
                that governed religious conduct under the requirements of <i>varnashrama-dharma</i> 
                delineated according to scripture, and instead women had their 
                own <i>dharma.</i> Various women exemplify different aspects of 
                this, for example, Kunti, Draupati and Sita. Although these women 
                were devotees, their roles were essentially supportive. Their 
                role was to serve their husbands. Though even these women experienced
