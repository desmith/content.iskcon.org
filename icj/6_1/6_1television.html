            <p align=LEFT><b>Introduction<br>

              </b>A Native American storyteller named Ron Evans tells a tale that 

              warms the heart of all who agonise over the effects of contemporary 

              media. Ron visited Africa some years ago and was present the day 

              electric lines were installed for the first time in a tiny village. 

              Along with wiring came a gift from the local government: the village's 

              first television. Ron describes how the entire village sat mesmerised 

              for three days watching every programme. Then as if on cue, rose, 

              turned off the set, and went about their business. Curious as to 

              their motives, Ron approached the village chief and asked, 'Why 

              did you stop watching the television?' The chief smiled and replied, 

              'We don't need the television. We have our storyteller.' Delighted 

              but not completely satisfied by the reply, Ron commented, 'The television 

              knows many stories, too.' The chief bowed his head thoughtfully, 

              then looked up with a smile and said, 'Oh, no doubt the television 

              knows many stories. But our storyteller knows us!' 

            <p align=LEFT>As a practising Vaishnava wary of the media's influence 

              on consciousness, I am encouraged by the innocent villagers' preference 

              for their storyteller over pre-recorded programming. But there is 

              a twist in this cautionary tale: I have never met Ron Evans. I heard 

              his story on TV. As troubling as it may be, television can serve 

              to enlighten, and we who hope for a more enlightened world must 

              acknowledge its influence and power. 

            <p align=LEFT>By now each hut in Ron's village probably boasts a TV 

              with remote control and satellite access to dozens, if not hundreds 

              of channels, for the electronic age has arrived, and nothing will 

              stop its penetration into every home in the world. Remote peoples, 

              many of them on the list of endangered species, feast on a daily 

              fare of <i>Beverly Hills 90210, Dallas</i> reruns, and assorted 

              game shows where contestants vie for goods that some of these viewers 

              have never even seen. What effect this exposure will have on the 

              traditional values and social structures of isolated cultures is 

              yet to be seen. What can be noted, however, is the spiritual decay 

              it wreaks on more mainstream societies. Can this influence be corrected? 

              Does spirituality have a place in broadcast? Can ephemeral frames 

              of film, or pixels on a flat screen, communicate spiritual truths 

              -or are the two realms mutually exclusive? 

            <p align=LEFT>In this article I will argue that a spiritual television 

              network can put this form of communication to use by educating people 

              about the non-fanatical side of religious thought, through believable 

              characters, humour and the kind of programming that television watchers 

              expect. This is not to suggest, however, that technology can solve 

              our problems. Recently, a woman told me that her daughter was seeing 

              a psychiatrist on-line to improve, of all things, her interpersonal 

              relationships. That type of blind faith in technology is disconcerting, 

              as are cybergurus who point to the Net and claim it is the fulfilment 

              of French philosopher Teilhard de Chardin's prediction of a new 

              stage in human evolution.<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#1">1</a> 

              More impressive to me are groups like the Amish who take a selective 

              approach to technology and pay little heed to the television screen. 

              Scriptures provide them with whatever information they need, and 

              community events provide their entertainment. From the perspective 

              of the Amish, television merely reflects the fraud and violence 

              of the outside world. Why invite that into the living room? 

            <p align=LEFT>Most of the world, however, does not take such a renounced 

              position. For ninety-three percent of all people on the planet, 

              television is a part of daily life. This fact must concern those 

              of us committed to proactive spiritual and religious thought. Interfaith 

              dialogue will remain incomplete until it deals effectively with 

              this single-most pervasive medium. 

            <p align=LEFT>A distinction should be made between religion and spirituality. 

              For the purpose of this article, religion will be taken to mean 

              beliefs characteristic of a particular people: a social and ritual 

              structure that serves to identify that people and distinguish them 

              from other peoples. Spirituality, in the context of this article, 

              means ideas, truths and practices that transcend any one human grouping: 

              wisdom, stories and truths which are found in a variety of religious 

              cultures and which serve to unite peoples, whatever their particular 

              religious persuasion or denomination. 

            <p align=LEFT>In this article, I will look at evidence that suggests 

              the time is ripe for a television network based on the stories, 

              teachings and practices of the world's spiritual cultures. I will 

              examine how television has become the common language of humanity, 

              but now faces a crisis of content; I will then go on to outline 

              the ways spirituality was partnered with technology in the past, 

              and consider how such a partnership could help resolve the crisis 

              television is facing today. Finally, I will explain why I believe 

              a well-run spiritual network is tricky but achievable, and then 

              briefly examine what such a network might look like. 

            <p align=LEFT><b>Television: The common language of humanity</b> 

            <p><i>Bonding via satellite<br>

              </i>The latest James Bond movie, always a good indicator of the 

              direction our world is taking, features a diabolical Rupert Murdoch-like 

              character who delivers such gems of dialogue as 'There's no news 

              like bad news' and 'Let the mayhem begin!' He manipulates broadcast 

              signals by pitting nation against nation, in order to feed his global 

              network with tomorrow's headlines today, thus beating out the competition. 

              Here is the anti-Christ as media mogul, with satellites as the new 

              tools for controlling people's souls. 'The best God ever managed', 

              he laughs, 'was a Sermon on the Mount!' 

            <p align=LEFT>Things may never reach this apocalyptic level: life 

              is much better scripted. It is true, however, that television will 

              soon reach nearly every person on earth by satellite, primarily 

              because people would prefer a TV to running water, and the cost 

              of a dish has dropped dramatically. The first satellite, a French 

              prototype named Spot 1, went into orbit in 1986. Picking up the 

              signal required huge electronic dishes that cost millions of dollars. 

              Today, twelve short years later, a pizza-sized home dish costs under 

              $100 and can pick up hundreds of channels. Recently, a Los Angeles 

              cable television executive showed me the top end of home entertainment: 

              an enormous dish in his backyard that receives signals from eleven 

              satellites circling the globe. I sat stunned as he clicked through 

              more than 1,000 channels from his lounge chair. It was a television 

              addict's dream and a thinking person's nightmare. 

            <p align=LEFT>The rate at which this proliferation has occurred is 

              breathtaking. In the past two years, one company alone, INTELSAT, 

              has launched twenty-seven communications satellites in geosynchronous 

              space, meaning they are out far enough in space to withstand gravity 

              and stay at about 22,000 miles up in one spot over the Earth's surface. 

              To broadcast over such distance, however, requires a very strong 

              signal. For a satellite to hear the weaker signal of a local cable 

              station, it needs to be in low-earth orbit-and that is the next 

              frontier in electronic technology. 

            <p align=LEFT>In 1997, Iridium LLC, a Washington D.C. based company, 

              began sending up a constellation of sixty-six satellites orbiting 

              about 480 miles up, enough of them that at least one will always 

              be overhead picking up and passing on weak-signal transmissions 

              to and from any spot on Earth. This year, OrbComm of Dulles, Virginia, 

              will put into orbit its planned constellation of twenty-eight satellites, 

              and Globalstar LP will begin launching a satellite constellation 

              of forty-eight to support mobile-telephone service. Teledesic Corp, 

              employed by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, has set a goal for its 

              fibre-optic quality telecommunications to be available anywhere 

              in the world. This will be achieved with a constellation of 288 

              satellites, which they aim to launch between the years 2000 and 

              2002. 

            <p align=LEFT>Further, digital technology now makes it possible for 

              one analogue channel to be compressed into as many as twelve digital 

              channels, and that translates into thousands of channels available 

              anywhere in the world. Just where this maelstrom of media will lead 

              is a matter of conjecture, but soon anyone with even a basic digital 

              television will have instantaneous, interactive access to those 

              thousands of channels. Consider that even today from Lome, Togo, 

              for example, with the right television set you can tune into a USA 

              home shopping network and if you see something you want, use your 

              American Express card to buy it on-screen. Even though credit approval 

              involves a 46,000 mile journey over telephones and computers, the 

              whole transaction can be completed in about five seconds. 

            <p align=LEFT> Technology has accelerated growth in many fields-communications, 

              science, medicine and biology-at such dizzying rates that the sophistication 

              of our tools has far outstripped our moral and ethical ability to 

              handle them properly. The dilemma is particularly pronounced in 

              broadcast, however, by virtue of its omnipresence. While only forty-three 

              percent of American households have computers, for example, ninety-seven 

              percent have televisions. More than sixty-eight million American 

              homes have a cable television service, and that means revenues for 

              programmers who can command the attention of the viewer. 

            <p align=LEFT>As the viewership of a programme increases, it becomes 

              more valuable in terms of bringing in advertising revenue. Broadcasters 

              are consequently desperate for programmes that will attract and 

              hold the attention of large numbers of viewers. Spiritual programmes 

              might be able to achieve this, but as very little has ever been 

              done with the concept, there is little evidence to support its commercial 

              viability. The majority of programmers choose the more predictable 

              audience winners such as sex, violence, profane language, adult 

              situations, gossip, crude humour and anything else that elevates 

              mediocrity. In children's television, such disturbing images risk 

              permanent damage on impressionable minds and hearts. 

            <p align=LEFT><b>Television: A crisis of content</b> 

            <p><i>Children's television<br>

              </i>To attract children's viewership to their programmes, many producers 

              use two formulas. One is 'I've-got-an-attitude' programmes, epitomised 

              by Nickelodeon's line-up of mindless game shows and ill-mannered 

              animated characters. The other is a range of programmes flaunting 

              vulgar and explicit sex, foul language and crude behaviour. To a 

              large extent the tactics are working: children watch it and think 

              they love it. That in turn creates high ratings, which generate 

              more money from advertisers. 

            <p align=LEFT>Vulgarity is most evident in programmes such as <i>South 

              Park</i>, the most popular programme on American cable television. 

              This show features four dirty-talking children who poison Granddad, 

              promote a boxing match between Jesus and Satan, and converse with 

              a talking pile of stool called 'Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo.' The 

              next most popular programme on cable television in America is professional 

              wrestling, which boasts as many children as adult viewers. The most 

              popular new programme among American teenagers is a series called 

              <i>Dawson's Creek</i>. In this programme a high-school boy, who 

              plays the leading character in <i>Dawson's Creek </i>has a sexual 

              affair with his English teacher. Another boy, a football player, 

              is mocked by some girls for being impotent. <i>TheJerry Springer 

              Show</i>, a daytime talk show that also targets teenagers, features 

              guests who reveal their sexual betrayals and then beat each other 

              up. Springer is now challenging <i>Oprah,</i> a popular but less 

              sensationalist talk show, for first ranking in daytime television. 

              Adding to the pile of electronic junk food is Howard Stern, a radio 

              talk-show host known as the king of 'shock-jocks,' who recently 

              announced he would begin a television version of his controversial 

              radio show. The statistics describe the situation succinctly:

                only 11,000 hours spent in the classroom.<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#6">6</a></li>

              <li>Despite network claims to the contrary, more than 1,000 studies 

                and reviews now attest to the fact that heavy exposure to television 

                violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and anti-social 

                behaviour, particularly in males.<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#7">7</a></li>

            <p align=LEFT>Robert Lichter, director of the Centre for Media and 

              Public Affairs in Washington D.C., told The New York Times recently, 

              'I'd say there's been a quantum leap downward this year in terms 

              of adolescent, vulgar language and attempts to treat sexuality in 

              shocking terms. People used to complain that television was aimed 

              at the mind of a twelve-year-old. Now it seems aimed at the hormones 

              of a fourteen-year-old.' 

            <p align=LEFT>Attempts are underway to get stations to adopt voluntary 

              codes of conduct, to restrict vulgar programming without fear of 

              losing their competitive edge, but the effort is meeting with an 

              unexpected enemy-indifference. Many parents think their children 

              are discriminating enough not to be influenced by television. Others 

              worry about censorship: 'Popular culture is so ubiquitous it's almost 

              impossible to combat', Lichter remarked. 'It's like the weather, 

              everyone complains about it but no one does anything. Perhaps in 

              frustration over their inability to do anything, some parents claim 

              that they watch with their children and then talk about it. Lost 

              in such weak reasoning is the fact that children are effected by 

              seeing vulgarity glamourised on the screen. 

            <p align=LEFT>The vacillating is enough to keep huge amounts of harmful 

              children's programmes on the air, and notwithstanding the few channels 

              such as Public Television or the BBC that continue to search for 

              quality, paranoia over religion has limited the offerings. 'Quality' 

              in the eyes of programme makers encompasses literature, 'real-life' 

              issues and developmentally appropriate content- but not spirit. 

            <p><i>Lack of content for adults<br>

              </i>Children are not the only ones to suffer from the lack of good 

              television programmes. Contrary to earlier predictions, the proliferation 

              of channels has not increased the quality of what is seen by grown-ups 

              either. In his book <i>Life After Television</i>, futurist George 

              Gilder forecasts a golden era of artistic expression, to be ushered 

              in by the telecommunications explosion: 'A new age of individualism 

              is coming, and it will bring an eruption of culture unprecedented 

              in human history.'<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#8">8</a> Certainly, 

              the balance has shifted somewhat in favour of the artist or content-provider. 

              Twenty-five years ago, there were only three US networks: today, 

              there are hundreds of channels, hundreds of places to take an idea. 

              That means however, advertising revenue has been divided over a 

              greater number of channels, and that, in turn, means networks have 

              less money to spend on programmes. Television is churning out hundreds 

              of hours of derivative, uninspired, shallow programmes each week. 

              The market is flooded with too many grade-C films and too many programmes 

              pandering to the same prurient interests - in other words, lots 

              of really bad TV. 

            <p align=LEFT>The antidote for many broadcasters has come to be known 

              as 'branded programming': The Fishing Channel, The Food Channel, 

              The Golf Channel, The Gardening Channel, each catering to the specific 

              interests of a community of viewers who, programmers hope, will 

              stay tuned and help boost ratings and revenues. No channel yet, 

              however, caters to the interests of viewers seeking true spiritual 

              content, and there is some evidence that such a channel would be 

              well received. 

            <p align=LEFT><b>Spirit and media</b> 

            <p>I became a producer in 1982 when I returned to the USA after living 

              in Krishna temples for twelve years and discovered the world was 

              raising viewers, not readers. I wanted to use film and television 

              to bring children together with the experience of literature. The 

              move away from literature and toward electronic media was underlined 

              by Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library who raised 

              an interesting question: he wondered if it would be possible today 

              for a written work to have the cultural effect that Goethe's Faust 

              had in Europe in the early nineteenth century. If not, he reflected, 

            <ul>

              <p>then what we've seen is a huge shift in the relationship between 

                consumption and cultural output. In our day, with so much information 

                coming through the line, and with the constant necessity to shift 

                between the trivial and the important it's hard to imagine a single 

                text having that kind of impact. In the late twentieth century, 

                we are a society that values output, speed, and productivity, 

                whereas art [and, one might argue, spiritual introspection] requires 

                time, reflection, tranquility, and space-all commodities that 

                are in limited supply these days.<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#9">9</a> 

            </ul>

            <p>From this perspective, there would seem little hope for cooperation 

              between spirit and media. Some evidence, however, suggests that 

              the two have been mutually supportive in the past and might be configured 

              to be so even more in the years ahead. 

            <p><i>A trend in the past<br>

              </i>It is significant that the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> begins with 

              a spiritual transmission. Blind King Dhritarastra and his secretary 

              Sanjaya sit miles from the battlefield of Kuruksetra. As events 

              unfold, they are revealed to Sanjaya from within his heart, and 

              he then reports them to the king. The most important scripture in 

              all of Vedic culture as far as Vaishnavas are concerned is, in effect, 

              the transcript of a live transmission! 

            <p>Is science not religion's sworn enemy? Is television not somehow 

              fundamentally anti-religious? According to David Noble author of 

              <i>The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit 

              of Invention</i>,<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#10">10</a> the 

              answer is clearly no. 'The technological enterprise', he argues, 

              'has always been an essentially religious endeavour.' Noble traces 

              the religious view of technology back to the early Middle Ages, 

              when innovation became associated with God's will and monasteries 

              became centres of invention as well as worship. The mechanical arts 

              were not religion's enemy but its instruments, helping to bring 

              about a return to pre-Edenic paradise. Giordano Bruno, who stood 

              at the brink of modern science, considered them to be a spur to 

              spiritual evolution: 'Always, from day to day, by force of necessity, 

              from the depths of the human mind rose new and wonderful inventions. 

              By this means, separating themselves more and more from their animal 

              natures they climbed nearer the Divine Being.' <a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#11">11</a> 

            <p>It is almost impossible to separate the religious impulse from 

              early science. Newton wrote commentaries on scripture. The English 

              scientist Robert Boyle wrote a treatise: <i>Some Physico-Theological 

              Considerations About the Possibility of the Resurrection</i>. Charles 

              Babbage-widely known as the father of the modern computer-believed 

              that advances in the 'mechanical arts' provide 'some of the strongest 

              arguments in favour of religion.' The first telegraph message was 

              a biblical quotation: 'What hath God wrought', while the machine's 

              inventor, Samuel F.B. Morse, was a generous donor to religious organisations. 

              Oppenheimer quoted the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> on seeing the first 

              atomic explosion. And Freemasonry, with its combination of religious 

              ritual and devotion to craft, has produced some of the most prominent 

              pioneers of science, particularly in the field of transportation. 

            <p>Vaishnavas would argue it is not mastery over technology but over 

              the senses, that elevates us closer to God. Vaishnava history, however, 

              boasts its own tradition of technological innovators. In the nineteenth 

              century, Bhaktivinoda Thakura introduced use of the printing press 

              to disseminate the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. His son 

              Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, grandfather of the Krishna Consciousness 

              movement, sent sannyasi disciples (devotees of the renounced order) 

              out preaching in automobiles, much to the shock and dismay of the 

              traditionalists who undoubtedly thought, 'There goes the brahmanhood.' 

            <p>His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acharya 

              of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, expanded 

              the acceptance of technology to its ultimate level: everything can 

              be used in service to God, he taught, expanding Vaishnava saint 

              Rupa Goswami's definition of renunciation as <i>yukta-vairagya,</i> 

              or freedom from the mentality of proprietorship. Vaishnavism views 

              all creation as essentially spiritual energy (<i>brahman</i>), covered 

              in this world by varying degrees of forgetfulness. Spirit covered 

              by forgetfulness is called matter. Matter dovetailed in service 

              to the Absolute regains its lost spiritual qualities. The art of 

              yoga, in Vaishnava terms, is the art of spiritualising everything 

              through engagement in devotional service (<i>bhakti</i>), and that 

              would include television. If we look to the Vedic scriptures, at 

              least, there is no impediment to a spiritual television network. 

              But will people watch? 

            <p><i>A trend in the present<br>

              </i>It has become a clich&egrave; that people are spiritually hungry: 

              bored by visionaries with exclusive handles on the truth, frustrated 

              by traditional religion's obfuscation, and hopeful of a fusion between 

              religion and science. The hunger does not always increase attendance 

              in churches and temples, but there is evidence that the public would 

              support richer spiritual content on television, which reflects growing 

              belief in God and the existence of miracles. A 1997 poll conducted 

              in the USA reported seventy-one percent of respondents as saying 

              they never doubt the existence of God.<a



 href="6_1televisionfoot.html#12">12</a> In 1987, the figure was sixty percent. 

              The poll also found that sixty-one percent of Americans believe 

              miracles come from the power of God- an increase of fourteen percentage 

              points from 1987. 

            <p>Some programmers are beginning to take note and cautiously respond 

              with programmes such as <i>Touched by an Angel</i>. For the most 

              part, however, television executives have not the slightest idea 

              of what 'spiritual' means, let alone how to make it into good television. 

              The Media Research Centre (MRC), a Christian media watchdog group, 

              has for the past several years, conducted studies of prime time 

              entertainment, charting television's treatment of religion. No ultimate 

              conclusions can be drawn from these studies; the data suggests, 

              however, that religion on television is portrayed more favourably, 

              more often, and to greater viewer satisfaction than in years gone 

              by. 

            <p>In its December 1997 report, the MRC observed a near four-fold 

              increase in the total incidences of religious content in prime time 

              American television programmes. MRC analysts studied virtually all 

              1996 prime time entertainment programmes on the six major networks 

              (about 1 800 hours) and discovered that the ratio of positive to 

              negative portrayals of religion was about two-to-one, a large improvement 

              over the 1995 survey margin. The MRC concluded its report with a 

              recommendation that networks try to duplicate the success of <i>Touched 

              by an Angel</i>, which ranks among the highest-rated programmes 

              on TV, by airing other faith-friendly programmes that show the importance 

              of religion to everyday Americans. 'Whether it's a child praying 

              before bedtime or a family attending a service', the report says, 

              'religion is an indispensable part of life for tens of millions, 

              and prime time's fully recognising this would be most welcome.' 

            <p>This well-intending but na&iuml;ve report fails to recognise that 

              showing a child praying before bedtime is a lovely image, but it 

              is a patch on a broken arm. We are facing a crisis of faith and 

              morality. What people fear most in media is being misled, and every 

              time an evangelist such as Jimmy Swaggart or Jim Baker is exposed 

              for not practising what he preaches it feeds that fear, and ratings 

              for religious programmes drop a few more points. Religion has an 

              image problem. Media is both the cause and the potential cure; but 

              it will take skilled producers and engaging programmes, not pretty 

              nativity scenes, for television to inspire viewers spiritually. 

              Pat Robertson did not know how to achieve that and ended up selling 

              his Family Channel to Fox, where it is now in the hands of the enlightened 

              beings who brought us Power Rangers and Beetle Borgs. 

            <p>It is worth noting that in their thirst for spiritually satisfying 

              programmes, seekers have abandoned television and turned to the 

              Internet. 'The Net encompasses many strange things, but those who 

              use it often and understand it well know it has a rich and haunting 

              mystical side', writes Jon Katz, media critic for <i>Wired Magazine</i>. 

              He goes on to say: 

            <ul>

              <p>Along with pornographers and teenagers, it attracts deeply religious 

                people of countless denominations engaged in extraordinary searches 

                into their own and others' souls. Ascetics, heretics, and true-believers 

                searching for God (or his or her equivalent) flourish in zines, 

                religious and mystical conferences, and on bulletin boards . . 

                .The business of sending and receiving messages has always been 

                a core notion of mysticism and spirituality. Countless millions 

                believe, or want to believe, that there are larger forces at work 

                in the universe. And they want to chat with them.<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#13">13</a> 

            </ul>

            <p>Those millions of Internet users might return to watching television 

              if they heard someone had started a truly spiritual television network. 

            <p><b>Spiritual television</b><b>-</b><b>tricky but achievable</b> 

            <p><i>The tricky parts<br>

              </i>When we speak of spiritual television, we need to draw a distinction 

              between commercial fluff (miracle cures, near-death experiences, 

              close-encounters with the Almighty) and carefully-crafted, compelling 

              programmes that respect scriptural wisdom and convey the tenets 

              of authentic religious traditions. The Global Network in the UK 

              and The Millennium Television Network based out of Hawaii and Santa 

              Monica, both still in formative stages, seek to achieve a kinder, 

              gentler television that would provide entertainment along with exposure 

              for issues such as human rights, and the contributions of indigenous 

              peoples. This is 'earth-friendly' and a step in the right direction, 

              but different from a spiritual network seeking to communicate scriptural 

              truths in viewer-friendly form. 

            <p>Truly spiritual television is possibly a twenty-first or twenty-second 

              century concept being forced into existence now by the 'autocatalytic' 

              nature of technology. When we design a faster computer, it lets 

              us create an ever-faster one, each innovation hastening the next, 

              creating an ever-increasing rate of change. In the race to keep 

              up, quality of content is lost. Quantity is what matters, the ability 

              to churn out enough television to fill the gaping maw of thousands 

              of channels broadcasting twenty-four hours every day. And that is 

              a concern that must be addressed-how can we serve the religious 

              experience with a television network that will not fall prey to 

              the commercial lures and artistic temptations of Hollywood? This 

              is no small dilemma. No doubt, programmes can be created that would 

              be both good scripture and good viewing because the technology and 

              the creative talent are both available. What is doubtful, however, 

              is our own moral stamina to resist the temptations of ego that are 

              the constant travelling companions of entertainment. Several people 

              in my experience, who started out well intending and spiritually 

              aware, fell victim to the allures, posturings and rhetoric of the 

              Hollywood establishment. Somewhere along the way, they suffered 

              a loss of vision, and their original ambition of bringing spirit 

              to television and film became just plain ambition. The religious 

              experience must never be stylised or allowed to become fodder to 

              satisfy a craving for entertainment. History and literature have 

              already been victimised by that craving, and precautions are needed 

              to avoid a similar experience with bringing scripture to screen. 

            <p><i> The bastardisation of History</i><br>

              Hollywood has blurred the line between history and historical fiction. 

              Steven Spielberg is a master storyteller, yet his recent film <i>Amistad,</i> 

              to use one recent case-in-point, has mistakenly been viewed as history. 

              An <i>Amistad</i> learning kit is being distributed to high school 

              and college teachers, encouraging them to use the film in classrooms. 

              The study guide erases the distinction between fact and fiction, 

              urging students, for example, to study the film's composite character 

              Theodore Joadson, rather than the real African-Americans on whom 

              he is based. 

            <p>The troubling assumption by the film's producers is that a subject 

              does not exist until Hollywood discovers it. <i>Amistad</i> is an 

              interesting historical film, but not in the way its producers intended. 

              Like other history-based films, <i>Amistad</i> tells us more about 

              the time in which it was produced than the events that it tries 

              to portray. <i>Birth of a Nation</i> revealed more about the racial 

              prejudices of 1916 than about the Civil War; Oliver Stone's <i>JFK</i> 

              reflected more of post-Watergate anti-government sensibilities than 

              verifiable conspiracy. <i>Gandhi</i> was more about Richard Attenborough's 

              feeling for India than about the way independence actually came 

              to that nation. In <i>Amistad,</i> white Abolitionists are portrayed 

              as self-righteous and hypocritical, reflecting contemporary cynicism 

              about broad social movements when, in fact, the Abolitionists were 

              largely responsible for winning freedom for those aboard the <i>Amistad.</i> 

            <p>For better or worse, those who make historical and biographical 

              films are fast becoming the most influential chroniclers of the 

              past. In part, this is because exposure to run-away technology has 

              created a generation of viewers rather than readers-people prefer 

              their history on-screen more than on the printed page. Filmmakers 

              and television programmers are the successors to the widely-read 

              historians of yesterday, like Francis Parkman and William H. Prescott. 

              This would not be so troublesome if more of them attempted to be 

              respectful of historical truth. 

            <p><i>The bastardisation of literature<br>

              </i>A glance at the movie section of any newspaper tells us something 

              else about media today. We have as much a penchant for filmed versions 

              of literature as we do for filmed versions of history: <i>The Wings 

              of the Dove</i>, from Henry James's 1902 novel; <i>Swept From the 

              Sea</i>, from Joseph Conrad; <i>Great Expectations</i>, by Charles 

              Dickens and almost any film by the Disney animation studios. There 

              has yet to be a film greater than the literary work on which it 

              was based. Perhaps that is because movies are the tribute illiteracy 

              pays to literacy: filmed classics allow people to experience the 

              forgotten delights of great literature without going to the trouble 

              of actually reading a book. 

            <p>Will spirit and the search for the self fall victim to the same 

              formulaic reworking that has plagued history and literature? I believe 

              that the problematic nature of spiritual representation in media 

              does not arise from the temptation to make its reality aesthetically 

              pleasing, as artistic expression has played an important role in 

              the spiritual experience throughout history. Rather, the risk comes 

              from the all too independent nature of the aesthetic process. For 

              television, the Internet or any form of media to carry spiritual 

              potency, content must be supervised by a council of qualified spiritual 

              leaders. If such a council were to work in tandem with a community 

              of like-minded programmers, directors, writers and producers, then 

              it might be possible to achieve what history and viewers, nauseated 

              by the overabundance of broadcast pabulum, have begun to demand: 

              a place on television where they can receive an accurate representation 

              of the spiritual experience in an engaging form. 

            <p><i>The achievable parts<br>

              </i>Entertainment today is an industry run by the <i>Star Wars</i> 

              generation. While they are not yet Jedi warriors, many talented 

              artists and directors share a sense that the world is more mysterious 

              than their predecessors believed. <i>Star Wars</i> itself, which 

              established a new mythos for the post-war generation, has at various 

              times been described as a metaphor for the tenets of Christianity, 

              Buddhism, Judaism and Islam. 'The message of <i>Star Wars</i> is 

              religious. [It tells us] God isn't dead, He's there if you want 

              him to be. . .The major theme in <i>Star Wars</i>, as in every Lucas 

              film, is the acceptance of personal responsibility, of the fact 

              that you can't run away from your fate.'<a href="6_1televisionfoot.html#14">14</a> 

              This is in scriptural terms, <i>dharma</i> or righteous duty-one 

              of many scripturally accurate ideas gaining favour in film and television. 

            <p>The signs are everywhere that the public is ready for a true spiritual 

              network, from <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>Touched by an Angel,</i> to 

              the abundance of Buddhist films to emerge in the past two years; 

              from the growing disgruntlement over fundamentalism to the surge 

              in populist spiritual movements. There is a thread connecting publics 

              of all persuasions- the desire for an alternative to both Western 

              materialism and religious fundamentalism. Somebody in television 

              is going to wake up and say, 'Hey, that sounds like a channel to 

              me.' 

            <p>Spiritual television is achievable not because statistics say so, 

              but because it feels right, and that instinct is as important as 

              any supporting data in this industry. There is no science to show 

              business: no rules, no formulas, no simple equations for success. 

              Behind nearly every media success there is a combination of intuition, 

              relationships, drive and <i>karma</i> (the result of past actions). 

              The odds are that same formula is the best justification for launching 

              a spiritual television network. 'Hollywood knows it's not a business,' 

              says Barry Sonnenfeld, director of <i>The Adams Family</i> and <i>Men 

              in Black</i> in a recent <i>Los Angeles Times</i> interview. 'That's 

              why people in Hollywood desperately want research and tracking charts, 

              so they can feel there is some structure and predictability. It 

              allows the people who run Hollywood to pretend it's a business. 

              But what it's really about is guessing and instinct. It's all in 

              the ether.' What is palpably in the ether at the moment is a spiritual 

              open-mindedness among young audiences. Young viewers are more sophisticated 

              and more fickle. There is no pulling the wool over the eyes of teenage 

              television viewers -their visual instincts are lightning-quick, 

              sharpened by years of video games and channel surfing. 'They're 

              much more visually astute', Sonnenfeld says, 'It's changed the way 

              we cut a movie because they get information so much faster having 

              grown up on MTV and commercials. They're used to getting stories 

              and absorbing them in thirty seconds.' A spiritual television network 

              can be built because the timing is right; spiritually-attuned people 

              are in the business and know how to make it look good; the public 

              wants it; technology is finally available that permits unearthly 

              visions to be depicted cost-effectively, and because of the abundance 

              of quasi-spiritual mediocrity, the scene has been set for a quality 

              channel to garner wide viewership. 

            <p><i>Twenty-four Hour Network verses a 'Nested' Channel<br>

              </i>To launch a full-time network is an expensive proposition, requiring 

              probably $50 million to create enough original and licensed programming 

              to fill a twenty-four hour schedule seven days a week for the first 

              year; build a Master Control Room to handle the shuttling of programme 

              tapes and output the signal, and rent pace on a satellite that will 

              bring the signal to anyone with a dish. 

            <p>A more economical way to launch a new network would be to 'nest' 

              it inside an existing network for three or four hours each day. 

              This would only require perhaps $5 million. The audience would be 

              limited to whoever was watching during those hours. As no one will 

              want to rent their prime time hours, the viewers of a 'nested' network 

              would likely be either stay-at-homes (noon to 4pm) or insomniacs 

              (after midnight). This would limit severely the amount of material 

              that the channel could air (we certainly would not be able to use 

              the full contents of the schedule that is outlined above) and this 

              option would not enable us to meet our objective to provide an alternative 

              type of viewing for a more spiritually aware lifestyle at all times 

              of the day. Our wonderful Spiritual Network would be an after-thought 

              on The Fishing Channel. 

            <p>If five sponsors put up $10 million, the full-time network could 

              be built. So, let us anticipate that five well-endowed churches 

              were to join together and finance a twenty-four hour network. Here 

              is what we might see. 

            <p><b>A spiritual television network: A sample</b> 

            <p>What is it that spiritual television has to offer viewers? Not 

              fellowship or association, which requires the conscious effort of 

              going to a meeting ground for the purpose of prayer, discourse and 

              God-centred activity. However, a spiritually centred television 

              network could offer positive messages, viewer comfort and it could 

              help nurture a new community. 

            <ol type="a">

              <li><i>Positive messages</i>. In an industry fuelled by violence, 

                negative role models and other negative messages, The Spiritual 

                Network would provide good news and practical tools for solving 

                material problems with spiritual answers, addressing the issues 

                of today with the insights of spiritual wisdom.</li>

              <li><i>Viewer comfort</i>. The channel would carry the seal of approval 

                from various denominations assuring that programmes are safe, 

                non-sexist, free of racial or religious stereotypes, and reinforcing 

                positive values and authentic spiritual practices.</li>

              <li><i>A new community</i>. A truly spiritual, ecumenical network 

                would reflect the culture of democracy. It would demonstrate the 

                ability to walk outside the conventional mechanisms of consumer 

                society-sensationalist talk shows, exploitative movies-and develop 

                a different, more satisfying vehicle for informing people. A big 

                part of spiritual television will be its ability to present the 

                experiences of people in the shared enterprise of self-awareness.

            <p><i>The Spiritual Network: Programme Schedule</i> 

            <p><i>4am - 6.30am: Morning services<br>

              </i>Each of the sponsoring churches would have a half-hour slot 

              for morning services. This would serve the needs of specific communities, 

              and we could anticipate that viewers would 'visit' other services 

              as well, contributing to a healthy ecumenism among congregations 

              that otherwise have little interaction. 

            <p><i>6am - 11am: Pre-school programming<br>

              </i>No children's network currently on-air focuses on the power 

              of storytelling. Even those programmes that purport to be literature-based 

              (PBS's <i>Wishbones,</i> HBO's <i>Tales for Every Child</i>) rarely 

              delve into traditional tales of spiritual cultures. The attention 

              spans of pre-schoolers are best suited to brief, magazine format 

              programming, and The Spiritual Network's unique contribution would 

              be a morning line-up of short segments based on the characters and 

              spiritual stories of the world's diverse peoples. 

            <p><i> 11am - 3pm: Daytime programming <br>

              </i>Aimed primarily at women and older people who stay at home, 

              the daytime slot would offer profiles of people famous and unknown 

              who have effectively integrated spiritual practices into their lives. 

              Women have their own experiences, and The Spiritual Network would 

              honour their unique spiritual journeys with 'Voices of Women,' a 

              forum for women committed to God consciousness. Also in the daytime 

              slot we could have cooking programmes that demonstrate how to make 

              food a part of life's spiritual experience; non-exploitative talk 

              shows focusing on the challenges and ways of integrating spiritual 

              life in the material world; travel programmes to places of pilgrimage 

              health programmes offering practical insights into well-being as 

              the result of a spiritually balanced worldview. 

            <p><i>3pm - 5.30pm: After-school programming <br>

              </i>Teen hosts would introduce younger viewers to award winning 

              animated and live-action films, approved by an evaluating organisation 

              for content and the age of the viewership. Each of the sponsoring 

              churches would have a day of programmes, or a joint committee could 

              determine the week's line-up from the many outstanding films, supportive 

              of spiritual concepts, available for license world-wide that have 

              never had a place to call home on television. 

            <p><i>5.30 - 9pm: Family programming <br>

              </i>Every evening, the network would offer viewers a variety of 

              family fare such as <i>Storyteller,</i> featuring distinguished 

              storytellers in concert and interview; feature films with follow-up 

              discussions by representatives of the sponsoring churches, and even 

              game shows configured to the brand of The Spiritual Network. Programmes 

              such as <i>Journeyman,</i> a dramatic series could also be shown, 

              with characters that use spiritual wisdom instead of violence to 

              resolve conflict. 

            <p><i>9pm- Midnight: Evening programming <br>

              </i>Adult viewers would have a wide range of programmes in evening 

              hours, from biography-style documentaries to performances of dance 

              and music, to celebrity readings of great literary works (both fictional 

              and scriptural), to news analysis, to sitcoms and situational dramas-good 

              viewing with a spiritual underpinning. 

            <p><i>Midnight - 4am: Late night <br>

              </i>For insomniacs the network would offer spoken-word recordings 

              featuring noted artists reading great works, complemented by gentle 

              video graphics. No need to watch-the images of purling streams, 

              mountain pastures, or dawn over the Himalayas would be incidental 

              to the listening experience. This is what radio used to be, an all-night 

              friend. 

            <p><i>Weekend programming <br>

              </i>Weekends would feature reruns of the week's best programmes, 

              plus talk shows, classes, sermons, lectures, 'World Beat' (a music 

              and dance programme for teens showcasing unusual East-West fusions 

              and interviews with featured artists) and local community access. 

            <p><i>Financial Support<br>

              </i>How would such a network be supported? A large portion of the 

              funding could come from big business. At some point in the not-too-distant 

              future, manufacturers and industry will recognise that their customers, 

              the people who keep them in business, want more than a faster, sexier 

              car: they want quality of life. If big business is to survive the 

              next millennium, it will have to demonstrate its appreciation for 

              a higher quality of living-environmentally conscious practices, 

              diversity, women and children's rights-in other words, the by-products 

              of spiritual vision. Sponsoring The Spiritual Network would be an 

              excellent way for businesses to demonstrate that vision to their 

              customers. As the more enlightened companies grow (those involved 

              with recycled goods and alternative energy sources, for example) 

              they, too, will have discretionary cash and would likely support 

              a television network that reflects their values. 

            <p><b>Conclusion</b> 

            <p>This article avoided dealing with some of the most difficult issues 

              surrounding the notion of a spiritual television network. How, for 

              example, would such an ambitious venture be governed? How ecumenical 

              would it be? Who would determine which denominations should be represented? 

              Would this be primarily for English-speaking countries? What would 

              keep it from becoming a battleground of ideologies? The challenge 

              will be to create an editorial board whose point-of-view serves 

              a wide audience. The attempt here was not to answer these complex 

              questions but rather to suggest that the time has come to ask them. 

            <p>The pastoral life of Vrindavan (the place of Lord Krishna's passtimes 

              that is sacred to the Vaishnavas), where the most sophisticated 

              article of technology is a churning pot, beckons from beyond the 

              electronic corner into which we have painted ourselves. But the 

              inner vision of that simpler, more sublime eternal realm comes only 

              after the lessons are learned, the senses calmed, and our dormant 

              love of God reawakened. Until then, our <i>darshan</i> or vision 

              of truth, might just arrive via satellite.
