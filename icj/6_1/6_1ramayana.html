            <p align=LEFT><b> Author: Ranchor Prime<br>
              Publisher: Channel Four Books<br>
              ISBN: 1-85585-443-0</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>To condense an epic tale, consisting of six books, containing 
              a total of 24 000 Sanskrit verses, into a 150 page storybook without 
              losing the essence and original meaning of the work would be a forbidding 
              task for anyone. However in his book, <i>Ramayana: A Journey</i>, 
              Ranchor Prime achieves just that with considerable success. The 
              original <i>Ramayana</i> chronicles the life of Rama who, as the 
              seventh incarnation of Vishnu (God), comes down to earth in human 
              form and thus suffers all the struggles and hardships that man is 
              forced to endure. At the beginning of the story, we see Rama as 
              a great prince who is destined to lead a life of comfort and opulence 
              in the prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya in Northern India. However, 
              on the eve of his coronation as king, Rama, together with his devoted 
              wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, is banished into the forest of 
              Dandaka for fourteen years, during that time he undergoes many hardships 
              and tests. The adventures of these three as they encounter sages 
              and gods, demons and animal lords, has become an integral part of 
              Indian culture over the centuries, and has been the inspiration 
              for numerous Hindu festivals. They meet many memorable characters 
              on this journey, who both help and hinder them, such as the monkey 
              Hanuman, who becomes Rama's devoted servant, Garuda, lord of the 
              birds and Ravana, king of all the demons. The climax of the story, 
              where Rama and Lakshmana battle with Ravana, who has kidnapped Sita, 
              is as thrilling as any contemporary tale. 
            <p>In his adaptation, Ranchor has expertly captured the mood of the 
              <i>Ramayana,</i> which is one of sacrifice and honour. His skilful 
              handling of the central characters as they face up to physical dangers 
              and tests of faith ensures that the reader can easily empathise 
              with their predicaments and rejoice when they triumph over adversity. 
              The vast assortment of human sages, animals and demons that Rama 
              encounters on his journey are sympathetically portrayed as souls 
              who are merely suffering the consequences of their past actions 
              (<i>karma</i>), encouraging the reader to feel compassion towards 
              even the most evil individuals whilst simultaneously abhorring their 
              deeds. In emphasising the humour, courage, honour and sacrifice-qualities 
              generally considered to be the prerogative of man only-displayed 
              by animals such as Hanuman and Garuda, the book also illustrates 
              the basic premise underlying Hinduism, that the body is merely a 
              covering for the true essence of the self, the spirit soul. 
            <p>There is much to commend <i>Ramayana: A Journey</i>. The story 
              is episodic, the six books of the original work being divided into 
              separate chapters that are all prefaced with a brief summary. Although 
              the pace of the book is fast moving, the author never loses sight 
              of the moral and spiritual aspects of the original work. I particularly 
              liked the way Ranchor caters for those of his audience who are not 
              familiar with Indian culture or Hindu philosophy. For example, in 
              his introduction he gives a brief history of the <i>Ramayana,</i> 
              the central themes of the story, its place in Indian culture and 
              the underlying philosophical teachings that it conveys to the reader. 
              There are also feature boxes throughout the book that provide information 
              on many aspects of Hindu beliefs, practices and social customs, 
              enabling the reader to appreciate and understand the story in its 
              cultural context. The book is beautifully illustrated throughout; 
              its colourful plates, based on ancient Indian art, depict scenes 
              from the story and allow the characters to jump up from the imagination 
              into reality. 
            <p>This edition of the Ramayana has the appeal for all ages as well 
              as to those who come from a culture outside that of the Hindu Tradition. 
              It is ideal bedtime reading for children as it contains all the 
              right ingredients of a classic tale-a handsome and brave hero, beautiful 
              damsel in distress, fierce battles and scary monsters. It can also 
              be used as an educational tool: to encourage children to respect, 
              understand and appreciate cultures other than their own; to teach 
              and reinforce customs and beliefs if they are already living in 
              an environment where Hinduism is practised as a way of life, and 
              to illustrate the importance of possessing good moral values such 
              as honour, truthfulness and mercy. I also consider this book to 
              be an excellent foundation for individuals who have a curiosity 
              about Hindu theology, but find the prospect of delving into the 
              luminous volumes and deep philosophical thinking they contain too 
              daunting a task. I believe <i>Ramayana: A Journey</i>, with its 
              simple but informative approach to the philosophical ideas contained 
              within the original, and the way it relates these ideas to Hindu 
              culture, provides a sound basis from which to start any journey, 
              be it educational or spiritual. As a relative newcomer to Hinduism, 
              I found Ranchor's book helped me gain a better understanding and 
              appreciation of both its philosophy and customs, and has certainly 
              inspired me to explore further.
