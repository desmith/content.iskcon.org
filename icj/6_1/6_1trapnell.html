            <p>One may feel legitimate concern prior to a meeting or conference 
              that the time will simply be filled with, rather than opened by, 
              words. What differentiates an intellectually stimulating lifeless 
              gathering from one in which the spirited synergy that is dialogue? 
              Perhaps it is a gift. Nevertheless, receptivity to such a gift is 
              not accidental; the conditions need to be set with attentiveness 
              and devotion. 
            <p>The conditions for this one-day dialogue were indeed splendidly 
              set by Anuttama dasa and the ISKCON temple in Potomac, Maryland 
              and by John Borelli, Director of Inter-religious Relations for the 
              National Conference of Catholic Bishops. In addition, Rockwood Manor 
              was surrounded by the bright colours of woods and perennials in 
              mid-April. The morning's weather report had predicted a day of rain; 
              we enjoyed instead a day of sun. As we gathered, self-introductions 
              happened easily and the range of backgrounds became apparent: natives 
              of England, Kenya, India, Korea, Vietnam, as well as the USA; Gaudiya 
              Vaishnavas and a Madhvite, as well as Methodists, Episcopalians 
              and Catholics, ordained and lay; academics, Church and ISKCON administrators, 
              a bank manager, a pastoral counsellor and the owner of two craft 
              galleries. 
            <p>As would happen frequently during the day, Kenneth Cacknell had 
              some difficulty in pulling us away from energised conversations, 
              to our seats around the table. After soliciting more formal self-introductions, 
              he described 'Our Place in the History of Hindu-Christian Dialogue.' 
              Focusing upon the past one hundred years, he applauded the fact 
              that Christians are now turning their attention from what has been 
              a fruitful but limiting fascination with Advaita Vedanta to engage 
              'other vital streams' of Hinduism-specifically, fellow 'religions 
              of the heart.' Drawing from M. Thomas Thangaraj's <i>The Crucified 
              Guru</i>, Rev. Cracknell suggested criteria relevant not only to 
              the theological task but also to our own dialogical one. Rooted 
              in commitment, dialogue must exemplify accountability to our own 
              traditions and to those of others. On this basis, dialogue may then 
              branch out in conversation both with one's own tradition and with 
              others', blossoming in a 'holistic vision' of God, world and humanity, 
              and bearing fruit in transformative praxis. As insightful as this 
              was to our perspective task, it was Rev. Cracknell's own heartfelt 
              enthusiasm for the Vaishnava-Christian dialogue that set the tone 
              for the day. 
            <p>Ravindra Svarupa dasa then guided us through the Vaishnava theory 
              of the soul. He explained that what we usually think of as a person 
              is comprised of a gross body, a subtle body or mind and the eternal 
              soul or <i>atman,</i> whose nature is <i>sat-chit-ananda</i> (being-knowledge-bliss). 
              Given that most of us are unaware of who we truly are, the Vaishnava 
              theory of the soul also elucidates why we suffer and indicates how, 
              in three stages, we can escape this suffering: initially, we identify 
              with the body and thus wilfully desire to enjoy the world independent 
              of God. In order to purify our intentions we must then negate body 
              and world temporarily to glimpse who we are apart from them, the 
              eternal soul or <i>atman.</i> Only then are we ready to embrace 
              body and world as divine creations and use them as the basis of 
              activity that serves God, rather than self. Such loving service 
              is the soul's natural activity and thereby generates no consequences 
              necessitating rebirth. Having shed our misidentification, when the 
              body dies, the soul remains as our eternal position, qualitatively 
              identical to God though not quantitatively so. 
            <p>Rev. Peter Phan's presentation on the Catholic view of the eternal 
              soul evoked intriguing resonances with Ravindra Svarupa. Rev. Phan 
              also utilised a three-stage schema, though his categories were historical 
              rather than mystical. According to Biblical teachings, human beings 
              are created in the image of God (<i>imago dei</i>) and thus are 
              not autonomous but essentially related to God-stewards over creation, 
              not simply users of it. In this early, Jewish and Christian context, 
              the human person is a unity of body, soul and spirit. This unity, 
              however, is eventually weakened in the Patristic period, especially 
              under the influence of the dualistic Neoplatonic view of the soul 
              as imprisoned within and seeking liberation from the body. Beginning 
              with Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century and continuing in 
              the contemporary period, the implications of the <i>imago dei</i> 
              are recovered and advanced: if we are created in the image of God, 
              and if God is constituted by relationships (Father, Son and Holy 
              Spirit), then we, too, are not monads, but are only persons to the 
              degree that we are in relationship. Reluctant to use the term 'soul' 
              because of the dualistic connotations it conveys, contemporary theologians 
              have retrieved the Biblical sense of the unity of the person in 
              terms such as 'spirit in the world' and 'embodied spirit'-a unity 
              more in line with current sensibilities, such as ecological awareness 
              and liberation theologies, both of which are grounded in a rejection 
              of the older dualism. 
            <p>One may note in passing the intriguing similarity in the trajectories 
              of the two theories of the eternal soul (one mystical, the other 
              historical), moving from an identification with the body and world, 
              through a necessary and dualistic negation of them, to a stage in 
              which body and world are reintegrated and reappropriated in relation 
              to the eternal soul (<i>atman</i>, spirit) and to God-Thangaraj's 
              'holistic vision' located at the heart of both traditions. 
            <p>In the hour-long discussion following the two talks, there were 
              lively interchanges both across and within traditions, as Christians 
              and Vaishnavas questioned each other, revealing important distinctions 
              between the views of Protestants and Catholics, and between Vaishnava 
              <i>sampradayas.</i> Specifically, Hindus asked Christians about 
              what is the state of the soul after death and about eternal damnation. 
              Discussion moved logically to the question of predestination and 
              then to grace in relation to free will. It was agreed that grace 
              is fundamental to both traditions. 
            <p>Conversation paused only briefly as we broke for a delicious 'karma-free' 
              lunch prepared by Tungavidya devi dasi and the Potomac ISKCON temple. 
              Seated at tables outside in the sun, participants talked informally 
              but animatedly on topics ranging from dahl to Docetism. 
            <p>Discussion after lunch focused on the following topics: the possible 
              relation of past <i>karma</i> to original sin, as explanations for 
              the human's wilful separation from divine will; Christian explanations 
              for different birth situations and the parallels (or lack of them) 
              to <i>karma</i> and reincarnation in Christianity and Judaism. Reflecting 
              a general sense of appreciation for such interchanges, Christian 
              participants employed the scriptural analogy of 'looting Egyptians 
              of their riches,' suggesting thereby that just as Christian theologians 
              borrowed from Greek philosophers in the past to explicate the Gospel 
              so some now are borrowing from Indian sources to explore Christ's 
              teachings further. Christians noted, for example, that we have tended 
              to focus on the servant-master relationship between human and divine 
              and thus benefit from the 'sweetness' of Gaudiya theology. To flesh 
              out the assumed mutuality of such gatherings, one might ask what 
              it is that Vaishnavas 'learn' from Christians -perhaps a question 
              for our next dialogue. 
            <p>Kenneth Cracknell then turned the group's attention to future meetings 
              in this area. A consensus quickly emerged that we would convene 
              at Rockwood Manor again next April for a weekend. Efforts would 
              be made to extend the invitation to other Vaishnava <i>sampradayas,</i> 
              while keeping the overall size of the gathering small (about twenty 
              to twenty-five). Various topics were suggested: most attention was 
              given to a dialogue based on two devotional texts, perhaps poetry, 
              one from each tradition to be distributed in advance. 
            <p>Our words indeed opened possibilities rather than limited them, 
              possibilities that collectively the participants felt compelled 
              to honour with more time in the future. Why meet again? However 
              learned we may become, the gift of that love to which both traditions 
              bear witness remains irresistible. Rev. Cracknell echoed this sentiment 
              in concluding the conference: Such events represent 'the dawn chorus 
              of a new creation . . . the first fruits of the messianic age.'
