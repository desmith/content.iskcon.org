            <p align=CENTER><i>This paper is drawn from a presentation given at 
              the 'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' conference held in Marina Del Rey, California, 
              5-7 December, 1997.</i> 
            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>This paper examines the question of what constitute appropriate 
              roles for women in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              (ISKCON). My purpose is to develop an analytical framework that 
              will be of use to ISKCON in further thinking about the role of women 
              in ISKCON. I use concepts developed in International Law in this 
              examination and I begin by explaining the benefits of a model that 
              incorporates International Law. The second section of this paper 
              addresses the relationship of Human Rights Law to our Vaishnava 
              philosophy and raises problems in our treatment of women up to this 
              point. In the next section I go on to discuss the kind of rights 
              that Human Rights Law embodies. Section four considers the application 
              of those human rights in ISKCON and examines the issue of protection 
              of women from an International Rights perspective. The concluding 
              section highlights actions that ISKCON should take in order to ensure 
              appropriate roles for women. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The benefits of International Law<br>
              </b>The first, and most important benefit of an International Law 
              approach in defining roles for women in ISKCON, is that it gives 
              us a coherent framework for resolving many different tensions. The 
              question of the role of women includes a number of different considerations 
              and would have an impact on our society as a whole. It is, in some 
              sense, artificial to divide our analysis into 'men's issues' and 
              'women's issues', because the treatment of women affects every member 
              of ISKCON, regardless of gender -women are wives, mothers, sisters 
              and service colleagues to men. Moreover, the question of the role 
              of women in ISKCON raises other questions, such as the relationship 
              our leaders have with ISKCON's members and the obligations of the 
              individual to ISKCON as an institution. International Law provides 
              an existing model that allows us to integrate these various concerns 
              into a coherent analysis. 
            <p align=LEFT>The second benefit of International Law is that it allows 
              us to create needed cultural variations in our practices. ISKCON 
              is an international organisation facing cultural variations in different 
              regions of the world. If we are going to be an effective organisation 
              for all people, and for women in particular, then we have to be 
              sensitive to cultural variations. Shrila Prabhupada expressed this 
              thought most easily and eloquently by saying we have to be attentive 
              to time, place and circumstance. International Law has already looked 
              at these cultural variations, and created a way of allowing people 
              some flexibility to tailor a policy to their particular region while 
              maintaining a structure that keeps any adjustment from sacrificing 
              underlying goals. 
            <p align=LEFT>I do not advocate that we take principles of International 
              Law and replace our own philosophy with International Law. However, 
              I contend that we can effectively use International Law to develop 
              a model within which we can test our adherence to our own philosophy. 
              We have numerous written sources of religious principles, in addition 
              to the examples implicit in the actual behaviour of Shrila Prabhupada. 
              It is our task to integrate this wealth of instruction into a coherent 
              policy on women in ISKCON. One part of our problem, particularly 
              in our treatment of women, is that we have focused on one or two 
              instructions, which have been taken out of context. We have also 
              used certain words arbitrarily without actually understanding what 
              those words actually mean. Finally, we have made sweeping statements 
              as justification for our policies even though those statements do 
              not reflect our actual activity. Consequently, we need to revisit 
              this issue of women's participation in a thoughtful and rigorous 
              manner. 
            <p align=LEFT>Law gives us the tools by which we can integrate numerous 
              instructions on individual issues. Law also teaches us to define 
              our terms and to test our rhetoric against our actions. The need 
              to accomplish these goals is particularly apparent when we examine 
              the role of women in ISKCON. Some of Shrila Prabhupada's statements 
              about women have been over-emphasised to the exclusion of other 
              contrary statements. As a result, our policies on women's issues 
              are imbalanced. The particular nature of these misconceptions about 
              women that we have developed in ISKCON is further developed later 
              in this paper. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Human Rights Law and Vaishnava Philosophy<br>
              </b>International Law is a particularly useful tool for ISKCON because 
              there is a theoretical similarity between Human Rights Law and our 
              own scripture. That similarity is in the idea of equality. In a 
              sense, it is ironic for members of ISKCON to discuss equality between 
              men and women because so often equality does not occur in practice. 
              However, the principle of spiritual equality is undoubtedly described 
              in our scriptures. There is a similar concept in International Law. 
              International Human Rights Law rests on the principle that everyone 
              is entitled to certain fundamental things because all human beings 
              share the same essence, and that essence is somehow sacred.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#1">1</a> 
              This fundamental principle is also described in our own scripture. 
              Krishna goes even a little further in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> when 
              he says that the enlightened sage sees a brahmin, a cow, an elephant, 
              a dog and a dog eater with equal vision.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#2">2</a> 
              In the related purport, Shrila Prabhupada explains that this equal 
              vision arises from the fact that all living entities have the same 
              essence and we all have the same relationship to Krishna.<a

 href="6_1radhafoot.html#3">3</a> There is, thus, an obvious philosophical basis 
              on which to compare our scripture and International Human Rights 
              Law. 
            <p align=LEFT>Despite this fundamental teaching, we have not yet accepted 
              this principle of equality in our society. There is a feeling in 
              ISKCON that souls in women's bodies are not equal, but suffer instead 
              from serious mental and emotional deficits. We are seen as being 
              less intelligent, untrustworthy and over emotional. Jyotirmayi Devi 
              Dasi described thoroughly in her paper, 'Women in ISKCON in Shrila 
              Prabhupada's Times'<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#4">4</a>, all of these 
              misconceptions about women and explained through Shrila Prabhupada's 
              own writings exactly why they are misconceptions. A very brief examination 
              of Shrila Prabhupada's statements reveals that he did not view his 
              female disciples as being less intelligent or less able than his 
              male disciples. In the <i>Caitanya Caritamrita</i>, Shrila Prabhupada 
              described his disciples, saying, ' . . . both boys and girls are 
              being trained to become preachers . . . these girls are not ordinary 
              girls, but are as good as their brothers who are preaching Krishna 
              consciousness.'<a

 href="6_1radhafoot.html#5">5</a> Shrila Prabhupada made a similar statement about 
              equality between Vaishnavas and Vaishnavis in a lecture in which 
              he described how women, <i>vaishyas</i> and <i>sudras</i> are transformed 
              through Krishna consciousness: 
            <ul>
              <p>[It is] Not that even though they become interested they keep 
                behind. No . . . with equal force with men, they also promoted. 
                So Kunti, out of her humbleness, meekness, she is presenting herself 
                that 'We are women, <i>striya</i>'. But she's not ordinary woman. 
                She's devotee. Similarly, any devotee woman is as good as Kunti.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#6">6</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Shrila Prabhupada never intended his female disciples 
              to be disparaged on the basis of their bodily forms. Rather, he 
              clearly instructed us that women engaged in the practice of Krishna 
              consciousness make equal advancement with male devotees. Indeed, 
              to believe otherwise would indicate a profound lack of faith in 
              the process of Krishna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>However, the belief that women are inferior is often 
              reflected in our policy and in our practice. Women are dehumanised 
              and devalued by our rhetoric and by accusations used to marginalise 
              them. At the 'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' conference, one woman described 
              how she was marginalised when she spoke out on the need for women 
              to give <i>Bhagavatam</i> class. She said it led to the end of her 
              career in ISKCON management. Having lived in the same community, 
              I can comment on her treatment from personal experience. Many women 
              who looked to her as a leader, including myself, were told that 
              she did not want to give <i>Bhagavatam</i> class because she was 
              more interested in making money than in working in ISKCON management. 
              Thus, she was presented as avaricious and the true facts of her 
              conflict with ISKCON management were concealed. Moreover, I have 
              heard the Women's Ministry dismissed as a 'group of women who never 
              cover their heads'. This statement, in addition to being inaccurate, 
              misses an important point. The real issue is the purpose and effectiveness 
              of the Women's Ministry; the extent to which the Women' Ministry 
              does or does not propose and implement sensible, useful policy for 
              ISKCON. The fact that some of the members of the Women's Ministry 
              may adjust small externalities in their dress according to time, 
              place and circumstance should not determine the value of the Women's 
              Ministry as a whole. The need to separate Krishna consciousness 
              from external rituals has been the subject of much discussion in 
              our sampradaya. Similarly, this external consideration is not the 
              proper measure by which to judge the Women's Ministry. 
            <p align=LEFT>There are even more insidious, subtle, day-to-day minimisations 
              of women that may be harder to observe. The language we use marginalises 
              women. When we say 'devotees and <i>matajis</i>' (<i>mataji</i>, 
              means mother) we are saying that women are in a category separate 
              from devotees. Such distinctions create a psychological space in 
              which women can be ranked just a little bit lower than the rest 
              of the Vaishnavas, who are the men. Clearly, everyone does not use 
              the statement for such a negative purposes, and the distinction 
              may be genuinely made out of a mood to offer respect, or used blindly 
              simply because the terms used have become the norm in our communities. 
              However, the language creates the space in which the minimisation 
              of women is possible. Those who are immature in their faith naturally 
              find these spaces and take advantage of them. 
            <p align=LEFT>Another example of the minimisation of women involves 
              the Mayapur <i>samadhi</i> of Shrila Prabhupada.<a

 href="6_1radhafoot.html#7">7</a> At the 'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' conference, His 
              Holiness Bir Krishna Swami very accurately described the historical 
              photographs that have been reproduced as paintings decorating the 
              <i>samadhi.</i> Surprisingly the female disciples of Shrila Prabhupada 
              are not in the paintings although they were in the original photographs. 
              It is without doubt disrespectful and a devaluation of women when 
              they have been deleted from our institutional history. More importantly, 
              this deletion involves the Mayapur <i>samadhi,</i> a place of enormous 
              significance in our movement. Thus, the message that we as women 
              get is multifaceted and extremely negative. First, we are told, 
              'Don't speak.' If you do speak, you run the risk of being one of 
              those women who never covers her head. In other words, you become 
              someone who should not be listened to, someone who is not reliable. 
              We are also told, 'Don't act', 'don't dance in the temple', 'don't 
              stand in front of the Deities', 'don't give class', 'don't lead 
              kirtan'<a

 href="6_1radhafoot.html#8">8</a> , and do not participate in many other activities. 
              And the murals in the Mayapur <i>samadhi</i> go even further and 
              say, 'Don't exist.' Women leave ISKCON and we are surprised. To 
              paraphrase Shrila Prabhupada, rather we should be surprised that 
              women have stayed. 
            <p align=LEFT><b> Applying the principles of International Law to 
              our society<br>
              </b>Having identified some of the main problems in the treatment 
              of women, we must first ask how the law can help us in solving these 
              problems. The law is relevant here because law involves relationships. 
              Law is a way of governing relationships by creating structure and 
              space in which those relationships can take place. When law works 
              well, it is because it has minimised conflict. We need such a structure 
              in ISKCON. We have many spaces where it is possible for the interests 
              of women and the need of women to be devalued or ignored. 
            <p align=LEFT>One of the things which we have not yet examined and 
              which is critical for all of our social development policies is 
              the question of what constitutes the proper relationship between 
              ISKCON and its members. At one point, though it may not have been 
              articulated, the relationship was viewed as an autocratic tie with 
              ISKCON functionaries giving pronouncements that could not be questioned 
              by individual members. This relationship led to situations that 
              were destructive to both ISKCON as an institution and to individual 
              members of ISKCON. Shrila Prabhupada himself specifically rejected 
              this type of relationship between institutional leaders and those 
              in their care.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#9">9</a> A new relationship 
              between ISKCON and its members has yet to be articulated. However, 
              there is currently much discussion of the need for ISKCON to support 
              and nurture its members.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#10">10</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>In the law we call this type of relationship a social 
              contract. It is a mutual relationship. There is plenty of evidence 
              in the Vaishnava scriptures to support the position that the relationship 
              between institutional leaders and members is based on a social contract. 
              Krishna Himself and Shrila Prabhupada have both indicated that the 
              relationship between individual and spiritual leader is a mutual 
              reciprocation. In the verses that Shrila Prabhupada liked to quote 
              so frequently from the last chapter of the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> 
              Krishna says, 'Engage always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, 
              offer obeisances to Me, worship Me. In this way you will come to 
              Me. I promise you this because you are so dear to Me.'<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#11">11</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>This verse describes a promise- Krishna tells his devotees, 
              worship Me and I will reciprocate. In the next verse, Krishna says 
              abandon all varieties of religion and I will deliver you.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#12">12</a> 
              Again, Krishna is describing a reciprocal relationship. The devotee 
              has an important duty to be obedient to the Lord and to surrender 
              to him, but they also have an equally important promise of support 
              and deliverance on the part of the Lord. 
            <p align=LEFT>This principle of mutuality is highlighted in the pastimes 
              of Lord Ramachandra. When, Ravana's brother, Dvisana, attempts to 
              surrender to Rama is an example to point. Rama's followers advise 
              Rama to reject Dvisana saying that he may be an enemy. Lord Rama 
              replied 'I <i>cannot</i> reject anyone who surrenders to me. I have 
              no choice.' (Emphasis mine.) So the Lord is bound, as Shrila Prabhupada 
              says, by His devotee's love.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#13">13</a> 
              That principle can apply to ISKCON as well. If we, the members, 
              surrender and serve Shrila Prabhupada's movement, then we fulfil 
              our duty to participate and to obey the laws of the society. At 
              that point, ISKCON has an obligation to reciprocate and to see that 
              the devotees are cared for.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#14">14</a> 
              In Human Rights terminology one would say that there is a mutual 
              relationship of rights and duties. In order to articulate what ISKCON's 
              duties would be we could talk about rights that we would have. 
            <p align=LEFT>In Human Rights Law, at the international level, there 
              are two types of rights. There is an International Covenant on Civil 
              and Political Rights which covers rights such as citizenship, voting 
              and ability to hold office.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#15"> 15</a> 
              There is a second International Covenant on economic, social, and 
              cultural rights which includes rights such as housing, food and 
              education.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#16">16</a> For the purposes 
              of our discussion in this paper, I will refer to these two categories 
              as participation rights and substantive rights. My theory is that 
              devotees in general, and women in particular, are entitled to both 
              kinds of rights in ISKCON. I further contend that there is an important 
              link between these two categories of rights. 
            <p align=LEFT>Women are clearly entitled to participation rights in 
              ISKCON at some level. We are allowed to become members of ISKCON. 
              We are allowed to take initiation. We are allowed to chant the holy 
              names. The <i>maha-mantra</i> is not a secret <i>mantra</i> given 
              only to men. So we participate at some level. There has been some 
              controversy about what that level of participation should be. This 
              topic is thoroughly covered in the paper presented by Jyotirmayi 
              Devi Dasi that is available through the Women's Ministry. In her 
              paper, Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi makes a compelling case for equal levels 
              of participation for men and women based on Shrila Prabhupada's 
              own writing and practices. 
            <p align=LEFT>In <i>Caitanya Caritamrta</i>, Adi Lila, chapter seven, 
              Shrila Prabhupada describes how Lord Caitanya adapted many of the 
              rules of Vaishnava etiquette to increase the effect of His preaching 
              and the spread of Krishna consciousness. In the purport to verse 
              thirty-two, Shrila Prabhupada writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>Not knowing that boys and girls in countries like Europe and 
                America mix very freely, these fools and rascals criticise the 
                boys and girls in Krishna consciousness for intermingling. But 
                these rascals should consider that one cannot suddenly change 
                a community's social customs. However, since both boys and girls 
                are being trained to become preachers, these girls are not ordinary 
                girls, but are as good as their brothers who are preaching Krishna 
                consciousness. Therefore, to engage both boys and girls in fully 
                transcendental activities is a policy intended to spread the Krishna 
                consciousness movement. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>There are two points raised by this purport which we 
              ought to carry into further discussions on this issue. 
            <p

 align=LEFT>First, Shrila Prabhupada indicates that the test of whether a woman's 
              participation role is appropriate is not whether it is Vedic.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#17">17</a> 
              Shrila Prabhupada says here that the test of whether a woman's role 
              is appropriate is whether it helps to spread Krishna consciousness. 
              If we truly thought in terms of what is effective for spreading 
              Krishna consciousness, many of the controversies between men and 
              women would disappear. 
            <p align=LEFT>The second point is one I previously discussed in section 
              two of this paper, that Shrila Prabhupada has created an analytical 
              exception to the statements that women are less intelligent or untrustworthy.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#18">18</a> 
              Women engaged in transcendental activities, that is women who are 
              devotees, are, according to Shrila Prabhupada, just as intelligent 
              as men engaged in devotional activities. 
            <p align=LEFT>We can now examine the presumptions that are prevalent 
              in ISKCON against the standard Shrila Prabhupada has articulated. 
              My perception, and others may disagree, is that we have a presumption 
              against women's participation in ISKCON. That presumption does not 
              mean that women do not participate in our movement. However, we 
              begin by presuming that women <i>should</i> not participate, and 
              then place the burden on women or their supporters to show why women 
              should be included. This presumption needs to be reversed if we 
              are to give women equal encouragement to develop in their spiritual 
              lives and serve Shrila Prabhupada's mission to the best of their 
              abilities. We should have a presumption of equal participation for 
              both genders. The burden then should be on those who argue that 
              the role of women should be circumscribed, for reasons of etiquette 
              or social custom, to articulate why and how such restriction relates 
              to our goal of spreading Krishna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>When we examine our treatment of women in a logically 
              rigorous manner, many of our practices appear unreasonable. For 
              instance, we often speak of 'protecting' women whenever we are accused 
              of gender discrimination. Disparate practices are held to be necessary 
              and even beneficial to women on the grounds that women need special 
              forms of protection.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#19">19</a> However, 
              this justification for discriminatory practices is incomplete. Those 
              who would use it must define what it is that women are being protected 
              from. Current ISKCON practice supports best the argument that women 
              are being protected from participating. Moreover, we must also decide 
              what the form of that protection should be. For instance, American 
              law requires that restrictions that limit rights must relate to 
              an important governmental purpose and be as narrowly defined as 
              possible. ISKCON could use similar principles in its treatment of 
              women, requiring that restrictions on their participation be related 
              to the goal of spreading Krishna consciousness and that these limits 
              be as narrow as possible. 
            <p align=LEFT>We must first ask what Shrila Prabhupada intended ISKCON 
              to protect women from. For this, we can consult his writings on 
              the subject. The most obvious context in which Shrila Prabhupada 
              discussed protection occurs in the first chapter of the <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i> 
              Arjuna tells Krishna that when irreligion is prominent, women are 
              prone to degradation. Arjuna informs Krishna that such women may 
              bear unwanted children to the detriment of society. In his purport 
              to this verse, Shrila Prabhupada says that women are prone to being 
              misled by irresponsible men and that the cause of their fall down 
              is mixing too freely with men.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#20">20</a> 
              If that is the kind of protection we are discussing, then I do not 
              understand how the dearth of women on the Governing Body Commission 
              (GBC)<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#21">21</a> or discouraging women 
              from accepting management positions in our movement protects us 
              from sexual exploitation. Such an argument requires a belief that 
              the men we would be working with under such circumstances are irresponsible 
              men. The rules ISKCON uses in this context do not appear rationally 
              related to the purposes Shrila Prabhupada has described for us. 
            <p align=LEFT>The next question is what form should this protection 
              take? In ISKCON, we have an unspoken assumption that protection 
              means restriction. We protect women by telling them 'you can't' 
              and taken to its extreme form this instruction becomes, 'you can't 
              leave the house.'<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#22">22</a> Even in slightly 
              less restrictive contexts which permit women to attend worship at 
              ISKCON temples, making flower garlands for the deities is sometimes 
              seen as the most suitable service for a woman. There is some similarity 
              between the protection model currently applied to women in ISKCON 
              and the techniques I use in raising my children. I give my children 
              crayons and colouring books and protect them by instructing them 
              to sit quietly and colour. Women in ISKCON get colourful bundles 
              of carnation blossoms along with tapestry needles and string. We 
              are instructed to sit quietly and make flower garlands. In ISKCON, 
              the current perception seems to be that women are comparable not 
              only to children, but to very young children. 
            <p align=LEFT>I do not believe that this 'woman as small child' model 
              is the one Shrila Prabhupada intended. In fact, examination of the 
              histories told by many of his early female disciples reveals that 
              Shrila Prabhupada himself did not treat women in this way. Their 
              stories reveal that Shrila Prabhupada protected them in three ways. 
              First, he educated his female disciples about their true identities 
              as spirit souls. Second, Shrila Prabhupada engaged women in devotional 
              service, a process by which they could attain liberation from death 
              and rebirth, the ultimate protection from worldly suffering and 
              evil. Finally, as Kausalya Devi Dasi detailed in her presentation 
              at the 'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' conference, when limited facilities 
              were available for the devotees' use, Shrila Prabhupada protected 
              his female disciples by giving them the lion's share of those physical 
              resources.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#23">23</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>In examining Shrila Prabhupada's actual behaviour toward 
              his female disciples, it seems fair to conclude that far from comparing 
              women to children who need protection, Shrila Prabhupada desired 
              a model in which women would be nurtured and supported and above 
              all encouraged to contribute as much as they could to the Krishna 
              Conscious Movement, rather than being reviled and restricted. Perhaps 
              we should redirect our efforts toward a model designed to ensure 
              that women are educated, engaged and provided with sufficient physical 
              resources in order to perform their various services effectively 
              within our organisation. 
            <p align=LEFT>This question of protection through the provision of 
              resources raises the second category of Human Rights, that is, substantive 
              rights. If protection really were our goal, then as an external 
              academic observer of the institution I would expect to see policies 
              directed towards that goal. The Women's Ministry and other members 
              of ISKCON have engaged in significant discussion concerning policies 
              that would be necessary to protect women members of ISKCON. That 
              list is legion, but if we examine protection from sexual exploitation 
              specifically, I would expect to see, among many other things, education 
              about the proper roles of men and women, <i>ashram</i><a href="6_1radhafoot.html#24">24</a> 
              facilities for women, and a policy prohibiting sexual harassment. 
              In fact, we have some of these things. We have training manuals 
              for our new members, but they do not often include material on how 
              to respect and protect women. We have <i>ashram</i> facilities. 
              However, we spend more resources on men's training and men's <i>ashrams</i> 
              than we do on comparable programmes for women. The Women's Ministry 
              is drafting a policy on sexual harassment, but without effective 
              support from ISKCON's management, that policy is unlikely to result 
              in meaningful social change. Thus, in spite of our rhetoric about 
              protecting women, an outside observer will find that we give more 
              substantive rights to men than to women. 
            <p align=LEFT>In ISKCON we find ourselves in the position of telling 
              our women members that they do not need participation rights because 
              we will protect them. But we then fail to provide the resources 
              by which that protection might come about. Human rights analysts 
              will tell you that when you decrease somebody's participation rights 
              without a corresponding increase in their substantive rights, that 
              person will be worse off than they were at the beginning.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#25">25</a> 
              This type of situation is the very definition of oppression and 
              dictatorship, which is surely not what Shrila Prabhupada intended. 
            <p align=LEFT>There is another aspect of the protection issue that 
              raises a slightly different philosophical basis for a duty on ISKCON's 
              part. That issue is domestic violence. In his presentation at the 
              'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' conference, His Holiness Bir Krishna Swami 
              mentioned a letter he had seen in which a male member of ISKCON 
              expressed his understanding that our Vaishnava etiquette permitted 
              him to beat his wife as long as he used only a leather belt on her 
              back or a sapling on her legs. Some male members in Southern California 
              have expressed the belief that Shrila Prabhupada stated that both 
              a wife and a <i>mridanga</i> required beating. I have personally 
              not seen any proof that Shrila Prabhupada endorsed wife beating. 
              Moreover, ISKCON's Governing Body Commission has specifically rejected 
              the claim that our philosophy justifies spousal abuse in any way. 
            <p align=LEFT>Given this institutional force which misguided members 
              are using to promote domestic violence, ISKCON has a duty to create 
              policies which will counter domestic violence. While the ISKCON 
              Women's Ministry has undertaken to create some policies and substantive 
              programmes to meet this need, we often hear excuses for institutional 
              inaction on this issue. The excuses we hear, lack of resources and 
              an inability to interfere between husband and wife, are clearly 
              insufficient. Given our somewhat chequered history which includes 
              (at the very least) the public perception that we have a poor record 
              on domestic violence, we have a duty to find the resources to counter 
              this destructive influence. Moreover, having given numerous, repeated 
              public instructions on the duty of the wife to tolerate any of her 
              husband's abuses and having given men some (false, but well promoted) 
              basis on which to justify their abuses, it seems a little late to 
              make the claim that we cannot become involved in the marital relationship. 
              If we make the claim that we protect women, then we must become 
              responsible and actually protect them. 
            <p align=LEFT>I want to return now to the issue of participation rights 
              because there is a clear link between participation rights and substantive 
              rights. The best way to ensure that people have substantive rights 
              is to give them participation rights.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#26">26</a> 
              So, the claim that we can safely relinquish our participation rights 
              in exchange for protection is simply untrue. Even with the best 
              of intentions, our leaders will be unable to safeguard our substantive 
              rights if we have too few participation rights. I am deeply suspicious 
              of anyone who tells us that we do not need participation rights. 
              Experience shows that we do need such rights.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#27">27</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>There are two reasons why ISKCON needs to pay particular 
              attention to this link between participation rights and substantive 
              rights. The first is that we have a limited ability to enforce any 
              substantive rights we create. We have no functioning justice system 
              in our movement. Although we have a Justice Minister and have developed 
              some grievance policies, our Justice Ministry has no staff and no 
              financial resources. Hence, our grievance policies are routinely 
              ignored. It would be unreasonable to assume that substantive policies 
              protecting women can be enforced effectively in this environment. 
            <p align=LEFT>Furthermore, there are important transaction costs which 
              function as barriers preventing our leaders from developing and 
              enforcing policies which would truly meet the needs of ISKCON's 
              women in an environment which excludes women from upper management. 
              Basic economic theory informs us that the development of any policy 
              to protect women will bring with it transaction costs including 
              the costs of gathering the information necessary to develop that 
              policy. Those transaction costs will include both monetary costs 
              and opportunity costs. If our leaders wish to develop substantive 
              policies to protect ISKCON's women, rather than allowing the women 
              to participate in management and work out for themselves what they 
              need, then our leaders must be willing to invest both time and money 
              in this project. 
            <p align=LEFT>These costs will operate as a significant barrier to 
              the development of substantive rights for women in ISKCON. ISKCON 
              leaders already plead lack of financial resources to explain lack 
              of substantive social development policies in our movement. Furthermore, 
              our leaders are consistently over engaged, that is, they have less 
              time available than they need to accomplish the tasks already assigned 
              to them. So there is little realistic likelihood of them as a group, 
              or even more than one or two individuals, making it their business 
              to find out what the women of ISKCON really need and to develop 
              the structures to meet those needs. Again, we return to the idea 
              that women need participation rights if they are going to have a 
              meaningful role in ISKCON and if ISKCON can truly claim to protect 
              them. 
            <p align=LEFT>There is another kind of transaction cost that is raised 
              by the exclusion of women from positions of authority in ISKCON. 
              That cost is the difficulty for women in identifying other women 
              who are spiritual role models. There are many visible male role 
              models, advanced spiritual leaders, whom we can easily identify 
              because they have visible symbols of advancement. They have <i>dandas</i><a href="6_1radhafoot.html#28">28</a>; 
              they have titles such as GBC representative or temple president. 
              At the very least, they sit on the <i>vyasasana</i><a href="6_1radhafoot.html#29">29</a> 
              during the morning programme and give <i>Bhagavatam</i> class. The 
              women in our movement, many of whom have been practising Krishna 
              consciousness longer than some of the male role models, are very 
              hard to find. They lack the visible symbols of advancement. Thus, 
              it has taken me more than ten years just to begin to identify the 
              women who can act as my spiritual mentors. Giving women participation 
              rights that permit them to give <i>Bhagavatam</i> class, to run 
              projects and temples, to sit on the GBC, allows the women of ISKCON 
              to find the role models we need to advance in Krishna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>There are three points that are essential to any policy that 
              would permit ISKCON to ensure appropriate roles for women.<a href="6_1radhafoot.html#30">30</a> 
              First, as I mentioned before, there should be a presumption against 
              limiting women's access to spiritual resources. Where women's access 
              is limited, policy makers must provide a written justification for 
              their decision, articulating how their policy is necessary to increase 
              the spread of Krishna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Second, we need women in leadership roles from the highest 
              levels down to the local temple communities. We need women in leadership 
              roles in significant numbers to prevent these leaders from being 
              isolated or marginalised by male administrators. One aspect of this 
              issue of female leadership that we have not yet addressed is the 
              extent to which men get a significant amount of informal support 
              in rising up through the ranks in ISKCON. This phenomenon is not 
              necessarily a sign of malice on the part of our leaders. Rather, 
              men develop intimate relationships with men in our society, as they 
              should. However, anyone in an intimate relationship with a leader 
              has access to a great deal of support and resources. Women do not 
              have that opportunity and will not have that opportunity until we 
              have significant numbers of women at high levels. Thus, ISKCON has 
              a duty to foster the development of women leaders. It is not sufficient 
              for ISKCON's management to say, find some qualified women and bring 
              them to us. ISKCON has the duty to find women who can lead and also 
              to find women who have the potential to be leaders and to give these 
              women the same opportunity to develop that is given to similarly 
              qualified men. 
            <p align=LEFT>When we have done these two things, we can progress 
              to the final prong, developing substantive policies, more effectively. 
              We must identify the needs of the women so that we can do two further 
              things. We must empower the women to meet some of their own needs 
              and we must develop structures that will provide women with the 
              resources and facilities they need. The focus of the Women's Ministry 
              has been, in large part, on providing women with a forum for working 
              together to meet their own needs. The recent 'Vaishnavis in ISKCON' 
              conference embodied that philosophy, involving women from across 
              North America who worked together under the direction of Sudharma 
              Devi Dasi to organise what His Holiness Hridayananda Swami described 
              as an historic event which could vastly improve our movement. 
            <p align=LEFT>Finally, we must all work together as a movement to 
              develop the structures and policies which will provide women with 
              the substantive rights they need for their protection and in order 
              to meet our goals of advancing Krishna consciousness. However, we 
              will work most effectively together if we increase participation 
              roles for women in ISKCON.
