            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>Tacitus, the classical Roman writer, claimed to have described 
              past events and personalities in his works <i>sine ira et studio</i>, 
              free from hostility and bias. This motto has guided serious historians 
              through the ages, and it became their highest ambition to write 
              history 'objectively', distancing themselves from opinions held 
              by interested parties. 
            <p align=LEFT>The ideal was not always followed, as we know. We have 
              seen twentieth century governments commissioning re-writings of 
              the histories of their countries from the standpoint of their own 
              ideologies. Like the court-chroniclers of former times, some contemporary 
              academic historians wrote unashamedly biased accounts of events 
              and redesigned the past accordingly. 
            <p align=LEFT>When, in the wake of World War II the nations of Asia 
              and Africa gained independence, their intellectuals became aware 
              of the fact that their histories had been written by representatives 
              of the colonial powers which they had opposed. More often than not 
              they discovered that all traditional accounts of their own past 
              had been brushed aside by the 'official' historians as so much myth 
              and fairytale. Often lacking their own academically trained historians-or 
              worse, only possessing native historians who had taken over the 
              views of the colonial masters-the discontent with existing histories 
              of their countries expressed itself often in vernacular works that 
              lacked the academic credentials necessary to make an impact on professional 
              historians. 
            <p align=LEFT>The situation is slowly changing. A new generation of 
              scholars who grew up in post-colonial times and who do not share 
              the former biases, scholars in command of the tools of the trade-intimacy 
              with the languages involved, familiarity with the culture of their 
              countries, respect for the indigenous traditions-are rewriting the 
              histories of their countries. 
            <p align=LEFT>Nowhere is this more evident than in India. India had 
              a tradition of learning and scholarship much older and vaster than 
              the European countries that, from the sixteenth century onwards, 
              became its political masters. Indian scholars are rewriting the 
              history of India today. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>The Aryan Invasion Theory and the Old Chronology<br>
              </b>One of the major points of revision concerns the so called 'Aryan 
              invasion theory', often referred to as 'colonial-missionary', implying 
              that it was the brainchild of conquerors of foreign colonies who 
              could not but imagine that all higher culture had to come from outside 
              'backward' India, and who likewise assumed that a religion could 
              only spread through a politically supported missionary effort. 
            <p align=LEFT>While not buying into the more sinister version of this 
              revision, which accuses the inventors of the Aryan invasion theory 
              of malice and cynicism, there is no doubt that early European attempts 
              to explain the presence of Indians in India had much to with the 
              commonly held Biblical belief that humankind originated from one 
              pair of humans- Adam and Eve to be precise (their common birth date 
              was believed to be c.4005 BCE)-and that all peoples on earth descended 
              from one of the sons of Noah, the only human to survive the Great 
              Flood (dated at 2500 BCE). The only problem seemed to be to connect 
              peoples not mentioned in Chapter 10 of Genesis ['The Peopling of 
              the Earth'] with one of the Biblical genealogical lists. 
            <p align=LEFT>One such example of a Christian historian attempting 
              to explain the presence of Indians in India is the famous Abbé Dubois 
              (1770-1848), whose long sojourn in India (1792-1823) enabled him 
              to collect a large amount of interesting materials concerning the 
              customs and traditions of the Hindus. His (French) manuscript was 
              bought by the British East India Company and appeared in an English 
              translation under the title <i>Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies 
              </i>in 1897 with a Prefatory Note by the Right Hon. F. Max Müller.<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              Abbé Dubois, loath 'to oppose [his] conjectures to [the Indians'] 
              absurd fables' categorically stated: 
            <ul>
              <p>It is practically admitted that India was inhabited very soon 
                after the Deluge, which made a desert of the whole world. The 
                fact that it was so close to the plains of Sennaar, where Noah's 
                descendants remained stationary so long, as well as its good climate 
                and the fertility of the country, soon led to its settlement. 
            </ul>
            <p>Rejecting other scholars' opinions which linked the Indians to 
              Egyptian or Arabic origins, he ventured to suggest them 'to be descendents 
              not of Shem, as many argue, but of Japhet'. He explains: 'According 
              to my theory they reached India from the north, and I should place 
              the first abode of their ancestors in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus.'<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#3">3</a> 
              The reasons he provides to substantiate his theory are utterly unconvincing-but 
              he goes on to build the rest of his migration theory (not yet an 
              'Aryan' migration theory) on this shaky foundation. 
            <p>Max Müller (1823-1903), who was largely responsible for the 'Aryan 
              invasion theory' and the 'old chronology', was too close in spirit 
              and time to this kind of thinking, not to have adopted it fairly 
              unquestioningly. In his Prefatory Note he praises the work of Abbé 
              Dubois as a 'trustworthy authority. . .which will always retain 
              its value.' 
            <p>That a great deal of early British Indology was motivated by Christian 
              missionary considerations, is no secret. The famous and important 
              Boden Chair for Sanskrit at the University of Oxford was founded 
              by Colonel Boden in 1811 with the explicit object 'to promote the 
              translation of the Scriptures into Sanskrit, so as to enable his 
              countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India 
              to the Christian Religion'.<a

 href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#4">4</a> Max Müller, in a letter to his wife wrote 
              in 1886: 'The translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great 
              extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls 
              in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them 
              what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all 
              that has sprung from it during the last 3 000 years.'<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#5">5</a> 
            <p>When the affinity between many European languages and Sanskrit 
              became a commonly accepted notion, scholars almost automatically 
              concluded that the Sanskrit speaking ancestors of the present day 
              Indians were to be found somewhere halfway between India and the 
              Western borders of Europe-Northern Germany, Scandinavia, Southern 
              Russia, the Pamir-from which they invaded the Punjab. (It is also 
              worth noting that the early armchair scholars who conceived these 
              grandiose migration theories, had no actual knowledge of the terrain 
              their 'Aryan invaders' were supposed to have transversed, the passes 
              they were supposed to have crossed, or the various climates they 
              were believed to have been living in). Assuming that the Vedic Indians 
              were semi-nomadic warriors and cattle-breeders, it fitted the picture, 
              when Mohenjo Daro and Harappa were discovered, to also assume that 
              these were the cities the Aryan invaders destroyed under the leadership 
              of their god Indra, the 'city-destroyer', and that the dark-skinned 
              indigenous people were the ones on whom they imposed their religion 
              and their caste system. 
            <p>Western scholars decided to apply their own methodologies and, 
              in the absence of reliable evidence, postulated a timeframe for 
              Indian history on the basis of conjectures. Considering the traditional 
              dates for the life of Gautama, the Buddha, as fairly well established 
              in the sixth century BCE, supposedly pre-Buddhist Indian records 
              were placed in a sequence that seemed plausible to philologists. 
              Accepting on linguistic grounds the traditional claims that the 
              Rigveda was the oldest Indian literary document, Max Müller allowing 
              a time-span of two hundred years each for the formation of every 
              class of Vedic literature, and assuming that the Vedic period had 
              come to an end by the time of the Buddha, established the following 
              sequence that was widely accepted: 
            <ul>
              <p><i>Rigveda</i> c. 1200 BCE<br>
                <i>Yajurveda,Samaveda,Atharvaveda,</i> c. 1000 BCE<br>
                <i>Brahmanas,</i> c. 800 BCE<br>
                <i>Aranyakas,Upanishads,</i> c. 600 BCE 
            </ul>
            <p>Max Müller himself conceded the purely conjectural nature of the 
              Vedic chronology, and in the last work published shortly before 
              his death, <i>The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy</i>, admitted: 
              'Whatever may be the date of the Vedic hymns, whether 1500 or 15 
              000 BCE, they have their own unique place and stand by themselves 
              in the literature of the world' (p.35). There were, even in Max 
              Müller's time, Western and Indian scholars, such as Moriz Winternitz 
              and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who disagreed with his chronology and postulated 
              a much higher age for the <i>Rigveda.</i> 
            <p>Indian scholars pointed out all along that there was no reference 
              in the Veda of a migration from outside India, that all the geographical 
              features mentioned in the <i>Rigveda</i> are those of north-western 
              India and that there was no archaeological evidence whatsoever for 
              the Aryan invasion theory. On the other side there were references 
              to constellations in Vedic works whose timeframe could be calculated. 
              The dates arrived at, however, 4500 BCE for one observation in the 
              <i>Rigveda,</i> 3200 BCE for a date in the <i> Shatapatha Brahmana</i>, 
              seemed far too remote to be acceptable, especially if one assumed-as 
              many nineteenth century scholars did, that the world was only about 
              6 000 years old and that the flood had taken place only 4 500 years 
              ago. 
            <p><b>Debunking the Aryan Invasion Theory: The New Chronology<br>
              </b>Contemporary Indian scholars, admittedly motivated not only 
              by academic interests, vehemently reject what they call the 'colonial-missionary 
              Aryan invasion theory'. They accuse its originators of superimposing-for 
              a reason-the purpose and process of the colonial conquest of India 
              by the Western powers in modern times onto the beginnings of Indian 
              civilisation: as the Europeans came to India as bearers of a supposedly 
              superior civilisation and a higher religion, so the original Aryans 
              were assumed to have invaded a country on which they imposed their 
              culture and their religion. 
            <p>A recent major work offers 'seventeen arguments: why the Aryan 
              invasion never happened'.<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#6">6</a> 
              It may be worthwhile summarising and analysing them briefly: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li> The Aryan invasion model is largely based on linguistic conjectures 
                which are unjustified (and wrong). Languages develop much more 
                slowly than assumed by nineteenth century scholars. According 
                to Renfrew speakers of Indo-European languages may have lived 
                in Anatolia as early as 7000 BCE</li>
              <li>The supposed large-scale migrations of Aryan people in the second 
                millennium BCE first into Western Asia and then into northern 
                India (by 1500 BCE) cannot be maintained in view of the fact that 
                the Hittites were in Anatolia already by 2200 BCE and the Kassites 
                and Mitanni had kings and dynasties by 1600 BCE</li>
              <li>There is no memory of an invasion or of large-scale migration 
                in the records of Ancient India-neither in the Vedas, Buddhist 
                or Jain writings, nor in Tamil literature. The fauna and flora, 
                the geography and the climate described in the <i>Rigveda</i> 
                are that of Northern India.</li>
              <li>There is a striking cultural continuity between the archaeological 
                artefacts of the Indus-Saraswati civilisation and subsequent Indian 
                society and culture: a continuity of religious ideas, arts, crafts, 
                architecture, system of weights and measures.</li>
              <li>The archaeological finds of Mehrgarh (copper, cattle, barley) 
                reveal a culture similar to that of the Vedic Indians. Contrary 
                to former interpretations, the <i>Rigveda</i> shows not a nomadic 
                but an urban culture (purusa as derived from pur vasa = town-dweller).</li>
              <li>The Aryan invasion theory was based on the assumption that a 
                nomadic people in possession of horses and chariots defeated an 
                urban civilisation that did not know horses, and that horses are 
                depicted only from the middle of the second millennium onwards. 
                Meanwhile archaeological evidence for horses has been found in 
                Harappan and pre-Harappan sites; drawings of horses have been 
                found in paleolithic caves in India; drawings of riders on horses 
                dated c. 4300 BCE have been found in Ukraina. Horsedrawn war chariots 
                are not typical for nomadic breeders but for urban civilisations. 
              </li>
              <li>The racial diversity found in skeletons in the cities of the 
                Indus civilisation is the same as in India today; there is no 
                evidence of the coming of a new race. </li>
              <li>The <i>Rigveda</i> describes a river system in North India that 
                is pre-1900 BCE in the case of the Saraswati river, and pre-2600 
                BCE in the case of the Drishadvati river. Vedic literature shows 
                a population shift from the Saraswati (<i>Rigveda</i>) to the 
                Ganges (<i>Brahmanas</i> and <i>Puranas</i>), also evidenced by 
                archaeological finds. </li>
              <li>The astronomical references in the <i>Rigveda</i> are based 
                on a Pleiades-Krittika (Taurean) calendar of c. 2500 BCE when 
                Vedic astronomy and mathematics were well-developed sciences (again, 
                not a feature of a nomadic people). </li>
              <li>The Indus cities were not destroyed by invaders but deserted 
                by their inhabitants because of desertification of the area. Strabo 
                (<i>Geography</i> XV.1.19) reports that Aristobulos had seen thousands 
                of villages and towns deserted because the Indus had changed its 
                course. </li>
              <li>The battles described in the <i>Rigveda</i> were not fought 
                between invaders and natives but between people belonging to the 
                same culture. </li>
              <li>Excavations in Dwaraka have lead to the discovery of a site 
                larger than Mohenjodaro, dated c. 1500 BCE with architectural 
                structures, use of iron, a script halfway between Harappan and 
                Brahmi. Dwarka has been associated with Krishna and the end of 
                the Vedic period. </li>
              <li> A continuity in the morphology of scripts: Harappan, Brahmi, 
                Devanagari. </li>
              <li>Vedic ayas, formerly translated as 'iron,' probably meant copper 
                or bronze. Iron was found in India before 1500 BCE in Kashmir 
                and Dwaraka. </li>
              <li>The Puranic dynastic lists with over 120 kings in one Vedic 
                dynasty alone, fit well into the 'new chronology'. They date back 
                to the third millennium BCE Greek accounts tell of Indian royal 
                lists going back to the seventh millennium BCE.</li>
              <li>The <i>Rigveda</i> itself shows an advanced and sophisticated 
                culture, the product of a long development, 'a civilisation that 
                could not have been delivered to India on horseback' (p.160). 
              </li>
              <li>Painted Gray Ware culture in the western Gangetic plains, dated 
                ca 1100 BCE has been found connected to (earlier) Black and Red 
                Ware etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let us consider some of these arguments in some detail. As often 
              remarked, there is no hint in the Veda of a migration of the people 
              that considered it its own sacred tradition. It would be strange 
              indeed if the Vedic Indians had lost all recollection of such a 
              momentous event in supposedly relatively recent times- much more 
              recent, for instance, than the migration of Abraham and his people 
              which is well attested and frequently referred to in the Bible. 
              In addition, as has been established recently through satellite 
              photography and geological investigations, the Saraswati, the mightiest 
              river known to the Rigvedic Indians, along whose banks they established 
              numerous major settlements, had dried out completely by 1900 BCE-four 
              centuries before the Aryans were supposed to have invaded India. 
              One can hardly argue for the establishment of Aryan villages along 
              a dry river bed. 
            <p>When the first remnants of the ruins of the so-called Indus civilisation 
              came to light in the early part of our century, the proponents of 
              the Aryan invasion theory believed they had found the missing archaeological 
              evidence: here were the 'mighty forts' and the 'great cities' which 
              the war-like Indra of the <i>Rigveda</i> was said to have conquered 
              and destroyed. Then it emerged that nobody had destroyed these cities 
              and no evidence of wars of conquest came to light: floods and droughts 
              had made it impossible to sustain large populations in the area 
              and the people of Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and other places had migrated 
              to more hospitable areas. Ongoing archaeological research has not 
              only extended the area of the Indus-civilisation but has also shown 
              a transition of its later phases to the Gangetic culture. Archeo-geographers 
              have established that a drought lasting two to three hundred years 
              devastated a wide belt of land from Anatolia through Mesopotamia 
              to Northern India around 2300 BCE to 2000 BCE. 
            <p>Based on this type of evidence and extrapolating from the Vedic 
              texts, a new story of the origins of Hinduism is emerging that reflects 
              the self-consciousness of Hindus and which attempts to replace the 
              'colonial-missionary Aryan invasion theory' by a vision of 'India 
              as the Cradle of Civilisation.' This new theory considers the Indus-civilisation 
              as a late Vedic phenomenon and pushes the (inner-Indian) beginnings 
              of the Vedic age back by several thousands of years. One of the 
              reasons for considering the Indus civilisation 'Vedic' is the evidence 
              of town-planning and architectural design that required a fairly 
              advanced algebraic geometry-of the type preserved in the Vedic <i>Shulvasutras.</i> 
              The widely respected historian of mathematics A. Seidenberg came 
              to the conclusion, after studying the geometry used in building 
              the Egyptian pyramids and the Mesopotamian citadels, that it reflected 
              a derivative geometry-a geometry derived from the Vedic <i>Shulva-sutras.</i> 
              If that is so, then the knowledge ('Veda') on which the construction 
              of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro is based, cannot be later than that 
              civilisation itself.<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#7">7</a> 
            <p>While the <i>Rigveda</i> has always been held to be the oldest 
              literary document of India and was considered to have preserved 
              the oldest form of Sanskrit, Indians have not taken it to be the 
              source for their early history. The <i>Itihasa-Purana</i> served 
              that purpose. The language of these works is more recent than that 
              of the Vedas and the time of their final redaction is much later 
              than the fixation of the Vedic canon. However, they contain detailed 
              information about ancient events and personalities that form part 
              of Indian history. The Ancients, like Herodotus, the father of Greek 
              histo-riography, did not separate story from history. Nor did they 
              question their sources but tended to juxtapose various pieces of 
              evidence without critically sifting it. Thus we cannot read <i>Itihasa-Purana</i> 
              as the equivalent of a modern textbook of Indian history but rather 
              as a storybook containing information with interpretation, facts 
              and fiction. Indians, however, always took genealogies quite seriously 
              and we can presume that the Puranic lists of dynasties, like the 
              lists of <i>paramparas</i> in the <i>Upanishads</i> relate the names 
              of real rulers in the correct sequence. On these assumptions we 
              can tentatively reconstruct Indian history to a time around 4500 
              BCE. 
            <p>A key element in the revision of Ancient Indian History was the 
              recent discovery of Mehrgarh, a settlement in the Hindukush area, 
              that was continuously inhabited for several thousand years from 
              c. 7000 BCE onwards. This discovery has extended Indian history 
              for several thousands of years before the fairly well dateable Indus 
              civilisation.<a

            <p><b>New Chronologies<br>
              </b>Pulling together available archaeological evidence as it is 
              available today, the American anthropologist James G. Schaffer developed 
              the following chronology of early Indian civilisation: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Early food-producing era (c. 6500-5000 BCE): no pottery. </li>
              <li>Regionalisation era (5000-2600 BCE): distinct regional styles 
                of pottery and other artefacts. </li>
              <li>Integration era (2600-1900 BCE) : cultural homogeneity and emergence 
                of urban centres like Mohenjo daro and Harappa.</li>
              <li>Localisation era (1900-1300 BCE ) blending of patterns from 
                the integration era with regional ceramic styles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Indian archaeologist S.P. Gupta proposed this cultural sequencing: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Pre-ceramic Neolithic (8000-600 BCE) </li>
              <li>Ceramic Neolithic (6000-5000 BCE)</li>
              <li>Chalcolithic (5000-3000 BCE ) </li>
              <li>Early Bronze Age (3000-1900 BCE) </li>
              <li>Late Bronze Age ( 1900-1200 BCE)</li>
              <li>Early Iron Age (1200-800 BCE)</li>
              <li>Late Iron cultures</li>
            </ol>
            <p>According to these specialists, there is no break in the cultural 
              development from 8000 BCE onwards, no indication of a major change, 
              as an invasion from outside would certainly be. 
            <p>A more detailed 'New Chronology' of Ancient India, locating names 
              of kings and tribes mentioned in the Vedas and Puranas, according 
              to Rajarama<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#9">9</a> looks somewhat 
              like this:

                the Puranas.<br>

                of Puranic dynastic lists: Agastya, the messenger of Vedic religion 
                in the Dravida country. Vasistha, his younger brother, author

                and the Indus-Sarasvati doab. <br>

                <br>

                1900 BCE Saraswati completely dried out: end of Harappa. 
            </ul>
            <p>Texts like the <i>Rigveda,</i> the <i>Shatapathabrahmana</i> and 
              others contain references to eclipses as well as to sidereal markers 
              of the beginning of seasons, which allow us by backward calculation, 
              to determine the time of their composition. Experts assure us that 
              to falsify these dates would have been impossible before the computer 
              age. 
            <p><b>Old verses new? Or scientists verses philologists?<br>
              </b>We are left, at present, with two widely differing versions 
              of Ancient Indian History, with two radically divergent sets of 
              chronology and with a great deal of polemic from both sides. Those 
              who defend the Aryan invasion theory and the chronology associated 
              with it accuse the proponents of the 'New Chronology' of indulging 
              in Hindu chauvinism. The latter suspect the former of entertaining 
              'colonial-missionary' prejudices and denying originality to the 
              indigenous Indians. The new element that has entered the debate 
              is scientific investigations. While the older theory rested on exclusively 
              philological arguments, the new theory includes astronomical, geological, 
              mathematical and archaeological evidence. On the whole, the latter 
              seems to rest on better foundations. Not only were the philological 
              arguments from the very beginning based more on strong assertions 
              and bold guesses, civilisations both ancient and contemporary comprise 
              more than literature alone. In addition, purely philologically trained 
              scholars-namely grammarians-are not able to make sense of technical 
              language and of scientific information contained even in the texts 
              they study. 
            <p>Consider today's scientific literature. It abounds with Greek and 
              Latin technical terms, it contains an abundance of formulae composed 
              of Greek and Hebrew letters. If scholars with a background in the 
              classical languages were to read such works, they might be able 
              to come up with some acceptable translations of technical terms 
              into modern English but they would hardly be able to really make 
              sense of most of what they read and they certainly would not extract 
              the information which the authors of these works wished to convey 
              to people trained in their specialities. The situation is not too 
              different with regard to ancient Indian texts. The admission of 
              some of the best scholars (like Geldner, who in his translation 
              of the Rigveda, considered the best so far, declares many passages 
              'darker than the darkest oracle' or Gonda, who considered the Rigveda 
              basically untranslatable) of being unable to make sense of a great 
              many texts-and the refusal of most to go beyond a grammatical and 
              etymological analysis of these-indicates a deeper problem. The Ancients 
              were not only poets and litterateurs, but they also had their sciences 
              and their technical skills, their secrets and their conventions 
              that are not self-evident to someone not sharing their world. Some 
              progress has been made in deciphering medical and astronomical literature 
              of a later age, in reading architectural and arts-related materials. 
              However, much of the technical meaning of the oldest Vedic literature 
              still eludes us. 
            <p><b>The Rigveda</b><b>-</b><b>a code?<br>
              </b>The computer scientist and Indologist Subhash Kak believes he 
              has rediscovered the 'Vedic Code' which allows him to extract from 
              the structure, as well as the words and sentences of the Rigveda, 
              and the considerable astronomical information which its authors 
              supposedly embedded in it.<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#10">10</a> 
              The assumption of such encoded scientific knowledge would make it 
              understandable why there was such insistence on the preservation 
              of every letter of the text in precisely the sequence the original 
              author had set down. One can take certain liberties with a story, 
              or even a poem, changing words, transposing lines, adding explanatory 
              matter, shortening it, if necessary, and still communicate the intentions 
              and ideas of the author. However, one has to remember and reproduce 
              a scientific formula in precisely the same way it has been set down 
              by the scientist or it would not make sense at all. While the scientific 
              community can arbitrarily adopt certain letter equivalents for physical 
              units or processes, once it has agreed on their use, one must obey 
              the conventions for the sake of meaningful communication. 
            <p>Even a non-specialist reader of ancient Indian literature will 
              notice the effort to link macrocosm and microcosm, astronomical 
              and physiological processes, to find correspondences between the 
              various realms of beings and to order the universe by establishing 
              broad classifications. Vedic sacrifices-the central act of Vedic 
              culture- were to be offered on precisely built geometrically constructed 
              altars and to be performed at astronomically exactly established 
              times. It sounds plausible to expect a correlation between the numbers 
              of bricks prescribed for a particular altar and the distances between 
              stars observed whose movement determined the time of the offerings 
              to be made. Subhash Kak has advanced a great deal of fascinating 
              detail in that connection in his essays on the 'Astronomy of the 
              Vedic Altar'. He believes that while the Vedic Indians possessed 
              extensive astronomical knowledge, which they encoded in the text 
              of the Rigveda, the code was lost in later times and the Vedic tradition 
              was interrupted.<a href="6_1klostermaierfoot.html#11">11</a> 
            <p><b>India, the cradle of (world-) civilisation?<br>
              </b>Based on the early dating of the <i>Rigveda </i> (c. 4000 BCE) 
              and on the strength of the argument that Vedic astronomy and geometry 
              predates that of the other known Ancient civilisations, some scholars, 
              like N.S. Rajaram, George Feuerstein, Subhash Kak and David Frawley, 
              have made the daring suggestion that India was the 'cradle of civilisation'. 
              They link the recently discovered early European civilisation (which 
              predates Ancient Sumeria and Ancient Egypt by over a millennium) 
              to waves of populations moving out or driven out from north-west 
              India. Later migrations, caused either by climatic changes or by 
              military events, would have brought the Hittites to Western Asia, 
              the Iranians to Afghanistan and Iran and many others to other parts 
              of Eurasia. Such a scenario would require a complete rewriting of 
              Ancient World History-especially if we add the claims, apparently 
              substantiated by some material evidence, that Vedic Indians had 
              established trade links with Central America and Eastern Africa 
              before 2500 BCE. It is no wonder that the 'New Chronology' arouses 
              not only scholarly controversy but emotional excitement as well. 
              Much more hard evidence will be required to fully establish it, 
              and many claims may have to be withdrawn. But there is no doubt 
              that the 'old chronology' has been discredited and that much surprise 
              is in store for the students not only of Ancient India, but also 
              of the Ancient World as a whole. 
            <p><b>Sorting out the questions:<br>
              </b>The 'Revision of Ancient Indian History' responds to several 
              separate, but interlocking questions that are often confused. 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The (emotionally) most important question is that of the original 
                home of Vedic civilisation, identified with the question: where 
                was the (<i>Rig-</i>)<i>Veda</i> composed? India's indigenous 
                answer to that question had always been 'India', more precisely 
                'the Punjab'. The European, 'colonial missionary' assumption, 
                was 'outside India'. </li>
              <li>The next question, not often explicitly asked, is: where did 
                the pre-Vedic people, the 'Aryans' come from? This is a problem 
                for archeo-anthropologists rather than for historians. The racial 
                history of India shows influences from many quarters. </li>
              <li>A related, but separate question concerns the 'cradle of civilisation', 
                to which several ancient cultures have laid claim: Sumeria, Egypt, 
                India (possibly also China could be mentioned, which considered 
                itself for a long time the only truly civilised country). Depending 
                on what answer we receive, the major expansion of population/civilisation 
                would be from west to east, or from east to west. The famous <i>lux 
                ex oriente</i> has often been applied to the spread of culture 
                in the ancient world. India was as far as the 'Orient' would go. 
              </li>
              <li>It is rather strange that the defenders of the 'Aryan invasion 
                theory', who have neither archaeological nor literary documents 
                to prove their assumption, demand detailed proof for the non-invasion 
                and refuse to admit the evidence available. Similarly, they feel 
                entitled to declare 'mythical' whatever the sources (<i>Rigveda, 
                Puranas</i>) say that does not agree with their preconceived notions 
                of Vedic India.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Some conclusions:<br>
              </b>If I were to judge the strength of the arguments for revising 
              Ancient Indian History in the direction of 'India as Cradle of Civilisation' 
              I would rate Seidenberg's findings concerning the Shulvasutra geometry 
              (applied in the Indus civilisation; Babylonian and Egyptian geometry 
              derivative to it) highest. Next would be the archeo-astronomical 
              determination of astronomical data in Vedic and post-Vedic texts. 
              Third is the satellite photography based dating of the drying out 
              of the Saraswati and the archeo-geographical finding of a centuries 
              long drought in the belt reaching from Anatolia through Mesopotamia 
              and Northern India. Geological research has uncovered major tectonic 
              changes in the Punjab and the foothills of the Himalayas. At one 
              point a section rose about sixty metres within the past 2 000 years. 
            <p>'Vasishta's Head', a bronze head found near Delhi, was dated through 
              radio-carbon testing to around 3700 BCE- the time when, according 
              to Hicks and Anderson, the Battle of the Ten Kings took place (Vasishta, 
              mentioned in the <i>Rigveda,</i> was the advisor to King Sudas). 
              A further factor speaking for the 'Vedic' character of the Indus 
              civilisation is the occurrence of (Vedic) altars in many sites. 
              Fairly important is also the absence of a memory of a migration 
              from outside India in all of ancient Indian literature: the Veda, 
              the Brahmanas, the Epics and the Puranas. Granting that the Vedic 
              Samhitas were ritual manuals rather than historic records, further 
              progress in revising Ancient Indian History could be expected from 
              a study of <i>Itihasa-Purana,</i> rather than from an analysis of 
              the <i>Rigveda</i> (by way of parallel, what kind of reconstruction 
              of Ancient Israel's History could be done on the basis of a study 
              of the Psalms, leaving out Genesis and Kings? Or what reconstruction 
              of European History could be based on a study of the earliest <i>Rituale 
              Romanum</i>?) 
            <p><b>An afterword:<br>
              </b>Hinduism today is not just a development of Vedic religion and 
              culture but a synthesis of many diverse elements. There is no doubt 
              a Vedic basis. It is evident in the caste-structure of Hindu society, 
              in the rituals which almost every Hindu still undergoes (especially 
              initiation, marriage and last rites), in traditional notions of 
              ritual purity and pollution, and in the respect which the Veda still 
              commands. There is a large area of Hindu worship and religious practice 
              for which the Veda provides little or no basis: temple-building, 
              image worship, pilgrimages, vows and prayers to gods and goddesses 
              not mentioned in the Veda, beliefs like transmigration, world-pictures 
              containing numerous heavens and hells and much more which appear 
              to have been taken over from non-Vedic indigenous cultures. There 
              have been historic developments that led to the developments of 
              numerous schools of thought, sects and communities differing from 
              each other in scriptures, interpretations, customs, beliefs. 
            <p>Apart from its Vedic origins Hinduism was never one in either administration, 
              doctrine or practice. It does not possess a commonly accepted authority, 
              does not have a single centre and does not have a common history. 
              Unlike the histories of other religions, which rely on one founder 
              and one scripture, the history of Hinduism is a bundle of parallel 
              histories of traditions that were loosely defined from the very 
              beginning, that went through a number of fissions and fusions, and 
              that do not feel any need to seek their identity in conforming to 
              a specific historic realisation. While incredibly conservative in 
              some of its expressions, Hinduism is very open to change and development 
              under the influence of charismatic personalities. From early times 
              great latitude was given to Hindus to interpret their traditional 
              scriptures in a great many different ways. The ease with which Hindus 
              have always identified persons that impressed them with manifestations 
              of God has led to many parallel traditions within Hinduism, making 
              it impossible to chronicle a development of Hinduism along one line. 
              The presentation of a history of Hinduism will be a record of several 
              mainstream Hindu traditions that developed along individual lines; 
              only very rarely do these lines meet in conflict or merge to generate 
              new branches of the still vigorously growing banyan tree to which 
              Hinduism has been often compared.
