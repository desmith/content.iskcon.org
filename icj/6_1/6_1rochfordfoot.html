            <ol type="1">
              <li><a name="1"></a>This article has been painful to write, and 
                certainly many readers will feel distressed by the story told 
                here. Many past and present ISKCON members-second generation devotees 
                and their parents alike- have personally been touched by child 
                abuse. And, as I suggest here, ISKCON's larger membership has 
                also been affected. One result is that child abuse has become 
                an issue of growing political significance within ISKCON and the 
                broader movement. While I am not so naive as to believe that this 
                paper will not become part of this ongoing politic, my attempt 
                here is to maintain a sociological stance to the issue. Yet it 
                seems likely that some readers will find reason to charge me with 
                partisanship of one sort or another, and perhaps even dismiss 
                what is said here (see for example, Rochford 1992). I would only 
                ask that devotees in and outside of ISKCON who care deeply about 
                this issue do something constructive to aid young adults abused 
                as children within ISKCON's schools. In need of support too are 
                the largely forgotten parents, who often suffer in silence, riddled 
                with guilt because of what happened to their children.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="2"></a>I had planned to address the ongoing efforts 
                by ISKCON authorities to address the problem of child abuse, including 
                assistance for abuse victims, child protection policies, and so 
                forth. Because of the length of the present article this did not 
                prove feasible. See Bharata Shrestha Das in this volume for details 
                of the response that members of ISKCON made in the 1990s towards 
                the problem of child abuse.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="3"></a>Yet there is no reason to assume that child 
                abuse is absent from ISKCON's communities. To the extent it does 
                exist, it is far more likely to occur within the context of nuclear 
                family life. Thus child abuse within ISKCON today likely mirrors 
                causes and patterns found within mainstream cultures.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="4"></a>While research and official statistics demonstrate 
                that child abuse has been on the rise, the question of why remains 
                less certain. Surprisingly, before the 1960s there were no laws 
                which prohibited child abuse in the United States (Pfohl 1985:309). 
                Yet within a few short years all fifty states 'discovered' the 
                problem and passed legislation to control it (Pfhol 1985:309). 
                The question is why, then? Violence against children was hardly 
                new in the 1960s. One researcher has shown that 'child abuse' 
                only gained legal status as the medical profession-specifically 
                paediatric radiology-was able to 'break the legal hold that parents 
                held over children' (Pfohl 1977, 1985:309). Thus the legal basis 
                of child abuse is derived from professional expertise and power. 
                Beating a troublesome child, an act taken for granted by many 
                parents even a single generation ago, is now often considered 
                'abusive', if not illegal behaviour. Obviously these issues are 
                critical to understanding child abuse as a social problem. Just 
                as obviously, such a treatment goes well beyond the scope of the 
                present paper. (For a social constructionist account of religion 
                and child abuse, see Jenkins 1996.) <br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="5"></a>Some researchers have expressed concern that 
                data from the American Association for Protecting Children (AAPC) 
                overstates the amount of child abuse in the USA. This is because 
                the AAPC data fails to account for duplicate reports involving 
                a single child. In counting the total number of abuse <i> reports</i> 
                these data overstate the actual number of abuse cases. Costin 
                et al. (1996:136) assert that the result is a 20% inflation of 
                the actual incidence rate. This conclusion seems born out by a 
                study conducted by Westat (1981) who found an incidence rate of 
                child abuse in the USA of 22.6 per 1 000 children. By contrast 
                the AAPC incidence rate was 32.8 per 1 000 children, 23% above 
                the Westat figure (Costin et al. 1996:136). <br>

              <li><a name="6"></a>Defining what we mean by child abuse and child 
                neglect is an important yet difficult task. Moreover, how we use 
                the term 'child abuse' in ordinary language often differs from 
                legal and social science definitions. What one person defines 
                as physical abuse, for example, another may view as necessary 
                discipline for an unruly child. Physical abuse is often defined 
                as inflicting physical injury by other than accidental means (Costin 
                et al. 1996:5). Corporal punishment by contrast is 'the use of 
                physical force with the intention of causing a child to experience 
                pain, but not injury' (Straus 1994:4). Physical abuse and corporal 
                punishment involve the use of violence in that both <i>intend</i> 
                to cause pain and suffering (Straus 1994:7). Child sexual abuse 
                involves a number of specific acts from fondling a child's sexual 
                organs, vaginal intercourse and sodomy (including oral and anal 
                intercourse). It may also involve an adult forcing a child to 
                fondle his or her sexual organs and child pornography. Psychological 
                abuse involves the attempt to inflict 'mental or emotional injury 
                that results in the child's physical or emotional deterioration' 
                (Costin et al. 1996:5). Child neglect is even a more ambiguous 
                concept to define. Typically, a neglected child is one that lacks 
                proper care and supervision from a parent or adult, or where the 
                environment represents a threat to his or her health (Costin et 
                al. 1996:5). Apart from these formal definitions there is another 
                offered by Rabbi Lawrence S. Kushner. While he speaks specifically 
                about 'parents' we could substitute 'adult'. In his address on 
                the occasion of Yom Kippur, he argues that child abuse 'is when 
                parents deliberately treat children as objects so as to gratify 
                themselves. It is using a child for one's own pleasure, without 
                regard to the child as an autonomous person . . . using them as 
                lightening rods for our own misdirected hostility, manipulating 
                their trust and love for our gratification against their will 
                . . . The child is deprived of personhood, autonomy, spontaneity, 
                the ability to respond freely and appropriately, sense of self 
                worth and holy uniqueness' (1990:7). <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="7"></a>Medical neglect of children has also been identified 
                as a form of abuse associated with religion. The Jehovah's Witnesses, 
                who do not believe in blood transfusions, and Christian Scientists, 
                who often favour prayer over medical expertise and procedures, 
                are perhaps the two most well known examples (Bottoms et al. 1995:88). 
                Citing First Amendment protections against government intrusion 
                in religion, these, and other religious groups, have generally 
                retained the right to refuse medical treatment. This trend may 
                be changing however as some states have successfully challenged 
                these legal exemptions, especially when a child's life is placed 
                at risk. (See for example, Skolnick 1994, on changes in Massachusetts' 
                exemption laws following the death of two and a half year old 
                Robyn Twitchell who died of a bowel obstruction after his Christian 
                Science parents denied him treatment.) <br>

              <li><a name="8"></a>These figures should be viewed with a certain 
                amount of suspicion, however. Information collected relied heavily 
                on individuals already undergoing therapy. Cases included were 
                therefore selective, and the findings reported <i>un</i>representative. 
                It is worth noting however the relatively large number of sex 
                abuse cases for both celibate and non-celibate clergy. This questions 
                the view that the Church's policy of celibacy explains paedophilia 
                among Catholic priests (see for example, Berry 1992). <br>

              <li><a name="9"></a>&nbsp;The noted author, sociologist and Catholic 
                priest, Andrew Greely, wrote the following in the foreward to

                and the sexual abuse of children</i>: 'Bishops have with what 
                seems like programmed consistency tried to hide, cover up, bribe, 
                stonewall; often they have sent back into parishes men whom they 
                knew to be a danger to the faithful . . . Catholicism will survive, 
                but that will be despite the present leadership and not because 
                of them' (1992:xiiv-xiv).<br>

              <li><a name="10"></a>In 1979 I served as a teacher's assistant for 
                a boy's <i>ashram</i> at the Los Angeles <i>gurukula.</i> In 1989, 
                thinking about the young boys who I often took to the park and 
                beach, I began an investigation of ISKCON's second generation. 
                I began by interviewing seventy first-generation parents in four 
                ISKCON communities in the USA Over the past eight years I have 
                also interviewed dozens of second generation youth about their 
                experiences in the <i>gurukula.</i> In 1992-3 I conducted a non-random 
                survey of second generation youth in North America (N=87). I have 
                also attended four <i>gurukula</i> reunions in Los Angeles and 
                at New Vrindaban, and served as a member of ISKCON's North American 
                Board of Education.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="11"></a>It was assumed that adolescent girls would 
                marry at an early age and hence none were sent to India for further 
                schooling. The rather 'primitive' living conditions in India also 
                were deemed unsuitable for adolescent girls. At ISKCON's New Vrindaban 
                community in West Virginia, for example, it was not uncommon for 
                girls as young as thirteen to be married or betrothed in the late 
                1970s. When many of these marriages failed, and girls and their 
                parents began to resist the idea of early marriage, adolescent 
                girls began attending local public schools. Lacking secondary 
                schools for girls within ISKCON, and with few other acceptable 
                alternatives such as home schooling, schooling children outside 
                became a solution, even if it was not always a preferred one. 
                (For a discussion of how attending state-supported secondary schools 
                has influenced the collective identity and religious involvements 
                of ISKCON youth in North America, see Rochford forthcoming.) <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="12"></a>In the midst of writing this article the teacher 
                and Headmaster of the Vaisnava School for Boys in Alachua, Florida, 
                was accused of sexually molesting four of his former students 
                some 10 years ago. He admitted his sexual misconduct and left 
                the ISKCON community in Alachua. The case was investigated by 
                Florida State officials, as well as by the Alachua ISKCON community 
                and ISKCON's Governing Body Commission (GBC). The school now only 
                accepts day students, having disbanded its <i>ashram</i> in response 
                to the molestation charges (Das, N. et al. 1998).<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="13"></a>Relying on estimates of child abuse is especially 
                tricky. For the fact is child abuse and children in general represent 
                ongoing social and political issues within ISKCON. Dedicated 'moral 
                entrepreneurs' (Becker 1963) are actively at work attempting to 
                make child abuse and the plight of ISKCON's children a publicly 
                defined social problem. As one might expect, many of those involved 
                are young adults who attended the <i>gurukula.</i> Many were themselves 
                abused. While opposition within ISKCON appears to be lessening, 
                a few leaders and some other ISKCON members continue to argue 
                that child abuse was only a minor and isolated problem involving 
                relatively few children. I raise these issues here not to in any 
                way diminish the seriousness of the abuse that took place. Rather, 
                I want to underscore the fact that no one knows with any degree 
                of precision how extensive child abuse actually was. Obviously, 
                systematic research on this question is long overdue. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="14"></a>The reader will note that normally individual's 
                names are avoided in order to maintain the anonymity of my interviewees. 
                In a limited number of instances, where I quote from <i>published</i> 
                sources, names are used, including the author's. However, in every 
                case, I avoid using names of alleged abusers in published and 
                unpublished sources, including the VOICE Web Page. The latter 
                source is an internet site established by ex-<i>gurukula</i> students 
                to expose the child abuse that they and their peers suffered. 
                This web site has become very controversial within ISKCON. Because 
                ISKCON leaders are concerned about the adverse public relations 
                impact of VOICE, the latter has exerted considerable pressure 
                on the leadership to respond constructively to the problem of 
                child abuse in general, and to the young people abused as children. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="15"></a>It appears that sexual abuse of children was 
                not limited to teachers and others working within the <i>gurukula.</i> 
                There are reports that single renunciate men (<i>brahmacaris</i>) 
                were involved in molesting children in India (Brzezinski 1997). 
                Allegations also persist that some male leaders associated with 
                the Mayapur, India, <i>gurukula</i> were involved in sexually 
                abusing children (Brzezinski 1997; Prabhupada Anti-defamation 
                Association 1993).<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="16"></a>This situation contrasts sharply with other 
                groups that have communalised children and child-rearing. In the 
                Oneida community, founded in northern New York during mid-1800s 
                by John Humphrey Noyes, children were also raised separate from 
                their parents in a community school. Yet as Kephart explains this 
                system of communal child-rearing was based on 'ample affection 
                and kindness . . . [and] that childhood in the Old Community was 
                a happy and exhilarating experience' (1963:268). This suggests 
                that the communalisation of children and child-rearing is not 
                in itself neglectful or abusive. (For a discussion of children 
                in the Kibbutzim, see Spiro 1958; Talmon 1973.) <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="17"></a>There is a fourth factor that I have been forced 
                to forego considering here because of limitations of space. This 
                involves a selective understanding of Prabhupada's views on disciplining 
                children held by some teachers and others working in the <i>gurukula.</i> 
                Simply put, some teachers felt that corporal punishment was fully 
                sanctioned by Prabhupada as a means to deal with unruly children. 
                And it appears that there is some evidence to support such a conclusion. 
                Yet, a close inspection of Prabhupada's ideas on child discipline 
                suggests that overall he was not in favour of physical punishment.<br>
                It is worth noting however that Prabhupada's letters and conversations, 
                now widely available from ISKCON's Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, were 
                not available to any great degree during this period. Most members 
                of ISKCON, including <i>gurukula</i> teachers, had limited and 
                certainly incomplete information concerning Prabhupada's views 
                on child discipline and other issues. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="18"></a>Ravindra Svarupa dasa (1994) states that Prabhupada 
                refused to sanction any further marriages beginning in 1974. His 
                1972 letter suggests the decision came earlier, although it is 
                possible that Prabhupada did not actively withdraw from marital 
                concerns until sometime after the letter was written. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="19"></a>The findings reported should be taken as reasonable 
                estimates rather than precise figures. Neither the 1980 or the 
                1991-2 surveys were based upon probability samples. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="20"></a>Prabhupada provided somewhat mixed messages 
                on the spiritual status of householders. He often reminded his 
                disciples that the entanglements associated with marriage and 
                family made it 'difficult to make any progress in Krishna Consciousness' 
                (Prabhupada 1992:852). The spiritual ideal therefore was to remain 
                an unmarried renunciate. Yet Prabhupada also said that,<br>
                <br>
                . . . if you cannot [avoid sex life], then get yourself married, 
                live with wife, but have sex only for progeny. Not for sense enjoyment. 
                Therefore even [if] one is married, then the husband is also called 
                <i>brahmacari.</i> Even though he is <i>grihastha</i> [householder]. 
                And wife is called chaste (quoted in Devi Dasi, U. 1992:6). <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="21"></a>This attitude continues to the present day. 
                ISKCON's leaders remain hesitant to engage issues relating to 
                children and family life, claiming that neither is the proper 
                domain of <i>sannyasis.</i> The result is that leaders have essentially 
                turned their collective backs on those issues most salient to 
                the lives of ISKCON's membership. There is evidence that this 
                stance may be changing however. See Das, B. in this volume. <br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="22"></a>During the 1970s and early 1980s it was common 
                for marriage partners to be selected by the leadership with an 
                eye toward reducing the likelihood that a particularly productive 
                <i>sankirtan</i> devotee would be lost to his or her local ISKCON 
                community (See Rochford 1997).<br>

                good collecting money, or distributing the most books. Never, 
                never ever [were] the teachers praised, or the kids who [did] 
                good at school.' <br>

              <li><a name="24"></a>It also resulted in long-term emotional consequences 
                for some second generation youth. As one reported: <br>
                <br>
                We don't want to trust anyone else with our feelings, our emotions, 
                our love . . . because we 'know' that that person will just turn 
                around and hurt us . . . They'll leave, they'll reject us . . 
                .'They don't really care about us . . . ' we think. I'm 26 years 
                old. I'm still struggling to trust someone on an emotional, 'feelings' 
                level, and to share my feelings with them. It's hard for me. Damn 
                hard. Being raised by 26 parents/caretakers from age 7 to 15 makes 
                it damn hard to place my love and trust in someone again. (Personal 
                communication 1998) <br>

              <li><a name="25"></a>Things became so bad financially that one winter 
                the school ran out of funds for coal to heat the school. Realising 
                that the GBC man responsible for the school was unlikely to help, 
                the Headmaster was forced to call on some of his temple president 
                friends for assistance. As he said, '. . . and they sent money 
                just because they realised &quot;Our friend is in need.&quot;

              <li><a name="26"></a>Questioning of Prabhupada's role in the child 
                abuse that occurred in the <i>gurukula</i> has only recently surfaced 
                as an issue among second generation youth. In fact the VOICE Web 
                page has given considerable attention to the issue. Those implicating 
                Prabhupada charge that he knew that children were being physically 
                punished, yet failed to directly intervene, or have leaders under 
                him put a stop to such behaviour. It does seem clear from Prabhupada's 
                letters that he was aware, as early as 1972, that physical punishment 
                was being administered to children in the <i>gurukula</i> (see 
                for example, Prabhupada 1992:797, 799). There is also evidence 
                suggesting that he did intervene (Prabhupada 1992:797). In a 1972 
                letter to a disciple who had complained that her child was being 
                mistreated in the <i>gurukula</i> in Dallas, Prabhupada wrote:<br>
                <br>
                But you may be assured that I am always anxious about the welfare 
                of my disciples, so that I am taking steps to rectify the unfortunate 
                situation . . . [C]hildren should not be beaten at all, that I 
                have told. They should simply be shown the stick strongly. So 
                if one cannot manage in that way then he is not fit as a teacher 
                . . . [H]e must have two things, love and education. So if there 
                is beating of child, that will be difficult for him to accept 
                in loving spirit, and when he is old enough he may want to go 
                away-that is the danger (1992:793). <br>
                <br>
                Yet physical punishment and various forms of abuse only escalated 
                in the years to follow. Some former <i>gurukula</i> students believe 
                that Prabhupada ' . . . did not implement appropriate measures 
                to guarantee the safety of children in his movement from his disciples. 
                [And] that the programmes he established and interpretations of 
                his words greatly fostered an environment under which child abuse 
                flourished' (Hickey et al. 1997). <br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="27"></a>This raises another issue about parental involvement. 
                Many of those who attended the <i>gurukula </i> had less than 
                close relationships with their parents. This may have dissuaded 
                some from telling their parents of the neglect and abuse present 
                within the <i>gurukula,</i> including their own abuse.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="28"></a>In one instance parents sending their child 
                to the Vrindavan gurukula developed a strategy to circumvent the 
                monitoring system in place. Responding to rumours about child 
                abuse, and the censuring of student mail by the administration, 
                the parents and child developed a code that would sound the alarm 
                if harmful things were occurring. In a letter to his parents, 
                the student would request pizza be sent to him through the mail. 
                This served as a request to be removed from the school.<br>

              <li><a name="29"></a>I am aware of one influential ISKCON member 
                whose son was sexually molested.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="30"></a>It may be worth noting here that the state-supported 
                school system in North America and elsewhere also serves the latent 
                function of providing childcare. In my own community some parents 
                were outraged when teachers at the local elementary school wanted 
                to release students early one afternoon a month so they could 
                discuss curriculum. Working parents were upset largely because 
                they had to find alternative child care arrangements.</li>
