            <p>If the success of a conference can be gauged by the degree of lively 
              engagement generated amongst the participants not only in the course 
              of the formal sittings but also the informal intervals between them, 
              this conference was a striking success. 
            <p>The near perfect setting of St Patrick's Trian, in the heart of 
              the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland, buzzed with the sound of 
              positive energy as just under one hundred delegates from home and 
              abroad mingled in the elegant concourses, exchanging greetings, 
              stories and experiences, and crowded the comfortable lecture theatre 
              in anticipation of a confluence of informed observation from a distinguished 
              panel of speakers from conflict areas around the world. 
            <p>The conference was indeed a ground-breaking opportunity to examine 
              the role of religion in community situations, from the widest possible 
              perspective, as Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish and Christian presenters 
              from South Africa, Sri Lanka, Israel, Canada, England and Ireland, 
              as well as Roman Catholic and Protestant representatives and members 
              of the ethnic/religious minority communities from within Northern 
              Ireland itself-expectantly met to learn from each other's experiences 
              and in the hope of returning to their own communities better informed, 
              and better equipped to make a positive contribution to the healing 
              of divisions within their local areas. 
            <p>One of the most helpful features of this conference was the sense 
              of realism and concern, which pervaded the two days of reflection 
              and debate, to face squarely the paradoxes and contradictions endemic 
              within cultural and religious conflict situations. Eminent speakers 
              and widely representative delegates were concerned to 'tell it how 
              it is', refusing to blur distinctions or gloss over differences, 
              while at the same time strenuously seeking positive pathways to 
              reconciliation. There was clear and unequivocal recognition that 
              religion can have both positive and negative influences as far as 
              communities in conflict are concerned. But it was precisely such 
              problems and complexities that the conference was concerned to try 
              and understand more fully, and the pooling of experience by people 
              of faith and hope, which characterised the whole event, proved to 
              be inspirational and educational for all concerned. 
            <p>The conference got off to an excellent start on the Thursday morning 
              with a specially arranged schools session involving Politics, Sociology 
              and Religious Education students from a number of institutions in 
              the area, and a representative panel comprising five of the main 
              conference speakers from abroad, under the chairmanship of Norman 
              Richardson of the Northern Ireland Inter-Faith Forum. 
            <p>The lively discussion which ensued focused mainly on the Northern 
              Ireland situation, which was, however, found not to be unique in 
              the potential of religion both for fuelling and defusing community 
              conflict. As is often the case, it was the pragmatism of youth that 
              kept the proceedings centred on essentials, in particular the necessity 
              of realising a 'just and durable peace'. 
            <p>The Thursday afternoon session addressed issues of faith and integration 
              by focusing on specific community projects and scenarios relating 
              to the Holy Land, South Africa and Sri Lanka, which served to highlight 
              the fact that there are common denominators to world conflict, and 
              that there are important lessons to learn from each other. 
            <p>While in no way presuming to tell the Irish people how to tackle 
              their own conflict, the message that come through from the case 
              studies discussed by the speakers in the course of the afternoon 
              was that there are other people with problems that seem just as 
              intractable as those problems in Ireland, and yet protagonists were 
              managing somehow to find solutions and to live together. 
            <p>By Friday morning the conference was in full swing, with greetings 
              and blessings from the Primate of the Church of Ireland and the 
              Primate of the Irish Catholic Church, both of whom spoke warmly 
              and optimistically of the crucial importance of mutual acceptance 
              and understanding by people of faith from all traditions and situations. 
              Archbishop Eames speaking of the major step in the reconciliation 
              process being the challenge to 'take a step into uncharted waters' 
              and Archbishop Brady proposing that 'the basis of respect is recognising 
              the good in others' and pointing out, with particular reference 
              to the Irish problem, that British or Irish nationalism 'is not 
              the most important thing'. 
            <p>One of the most salutary comments of the day came from Yasmin Sooka, 
              chairing the conference as Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation 
              Commission of South Africa, when she said that 'we need to pursue 
              peace even when we are grossly provoked; in the end, people die, 
              not Catholics or Protestants or Hindus or Muslims!' 
            <p>Following Yasmin's introduction, Dr Duncan Morrow, Lecturer in 
              Politics at the University of Ulster and Chairman of the Community 
              Relations Council, which has a multicultural/multifaith remit, spoke 
              inspirationally of the importance of humility in overcoming the 
              pride that leads to violence and conflict. It was necessary to understand 
              that the age of the 'Constantinian Settlement' was over for Christianity 
              in the West, and religion, therefore, was now often identified with 
              exclusion rather than inclusion. But reliance on force or power 
              was hopeless. Dialogue, while neither the same as agreement or mission, 
              was still an underdeveloped skill for Christians in Ireland. He 
              pertinently pointed out that without people from the non-Christian 
              groups 'we would not be here today' and made the important observation 
              that dialogue will not be a 'single meeting' but a series of strata 
              or encounters relevant to the different non-Christian groups. 
            <p>Responses by Professor Klaus Klostermaier of the University of 
              Manitoba, and Rev. Marcus Braybrooke of the Oxford International 
              Inter-faith Centre, took up the theme of humility. They emphasised 
              that without a willingness to change and change radically we could 
              not claim to be Christian, and the need for repentance for the pain 
              and suffering caused by Christian pride, which required now to be 
              purged of every vestige of triumphalism, acquiring a 'certain detachment' 
              that knows that the outcome is in God's hands. 
            <p>The morning session was followed by a sumptuous luncheon provided 
              by the Belfast Hare Krishna Community-described by one delegate 
              as a 'work of sheer genius' in catering so lavishly and carefully 
              for the dietary requirements of a myriad of religious traditions, 
              to the 'full satisfaction' of all who partook of the meal. 
            <p>After lunch, the delegates reassembled for the final leg of the 
              conference which focused sharply on the Sarvodaya model of peace-making 
              in Sri Lanka, and vigorously on the theme of obstacles to co-operation 
              in conflict situations. 
            <p>Describing the Sarvodaya initiative, Saliya Ranasinghe (while cautioning 
              that 'there are more resources for peace-breaking than for peace-making') 
              vividly outlined a movement, very much inspired by the teaching 
              of the Buddha and the non-violent principles of Mahatma Gandhi, 
              which was bringing together old and young, rich and poor, men and 
              women, in a real brotherhood, working co-operatively and compassionately 
              for social, cultural, economic and spiritual change. 
            <p>In responding, Father Redmond Fitzmaurice of the Irish School of 
              Ecumenics, accepted that in certain circumstances religion rather 
              than contributing to peace, can be a cause of violence and strife. 
              But while some saw religion as a problem rather than a solution, 
              others have found in it a transcendent and transcending energy, 
              enabling and empowering people to achieve harmonious and peaceful 
              symbiosis. Indeed, without the mitigating influence of religiously 
              dedicated people, Northern Ireland would be more devastated by communal 
              strife than it already is. As Christians we could identify with 
              the Buddhist concept of transcendent, transforming power, as in 
              some way reflected in the Christian imperative to manifest the fruits 
              of the Spirit in love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, faith, 
              meekness and temperance. 
            <p>Delivering the final conference paper, Dr David Stevens, General 
              Secretary of the Irish Council of Churches, spoke trenchantly of 
              the obstacles and opportunities within the Irish situation. Churches 
              mirrored and institutionalised political and cultural divisions 
              in Northern Ireland. They were significant restrainers of conflict 
              and violence. Some church people were the most committed in terms 
              of peace, reconciliation and co-operation in Northern Ireland-and 
              this has been so since the start of the troubles. Yet within churches 
              we had some of the people who have been most opposed to co-operation 
              and meeting people. Transcendent faith could make people different: 
              able to stand out against community hatred, able to cross community 
              boundaries, able to be peacemakers, able to forgive, able to stand 
              as victims, able to work for justice. Seeing this difference, we 
              were in the presence of transcendence. The puzzle for people of 
              faith was: why is there so little of it? One explanation was that 
              in divided societies (and perhaps this was part of the human condition) 
              fear, anxiety, a sense of threat were almost encoded within them 
              and became part of their genetic make-up. As the dynamics of conflict 
              gathered force, we disappeared into a vortex of antagonism-we became 
              'magnetised' by violence. It took a very strong people to stand 
              out when all around succumbed. This was true in Rwanda, Bosnia and 
              many other areas that have experienced conflict. We were left then 
              with the jealous face, or faces, of religion. David revived a striking 
              metaphor of the reality of religion, that is particularly apt for 
              this occasion: 'There is a through-otherness about Armagh, from 
              tower, from steeple-' (from the Ulster Presbyterian poet, W.R. Rodgers), 
              and the reality of religion was that it is through-other! In the 
              ecclesiastical capital of Ireland it was important to acknowledge 
              it-it was all mixed up and would be till the end of time and the 
              coming in of the Kingdom! 
            <p>In his Islamic response, Professor Mustafa Abu-Sway of Al-Quds 
              University in Palestine, drew attention to parallels and differences 
              between the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the Irish problem. 
              The Irish problem was an inter-community problem within Christianity 
              itself; the conflict in the Holy Land was mainly between people 
              of different religions, belonging to the Abrahamic tradition. At 
              the same time the distinction had to be made between the attitudes 
              and aspirations of Zionist and non-Zionist Jews, and between Muslims 
              with peaceful attitudes and Islamic extremists. It should also be 
              remembered that there are those on all sides who have 'used the 
              religious ticket' to keep the conflict alive. 
            <p>Also responding to David Stevens' paper, Yehezkel Landau, co-founder 
              and administrative director of 'Open House', Israel, a project involving 
              Arab and Israeli co-operative and educational developments, brought 
              the formal conference to a resonant conclusion with his message 
              of realism and hope. Quoting the Irish poet, George William Russell, 
              he underlined the fact that terrorists have appeared on both sides 
              of our conflicts, each blaming the other and whitewashing their 
              own side: 'By intensity of hatred nations create in themselves the 
              characters they imagine in their enemies. Hence it is that all passionate 
              conflicts result in the interchange of characteristics!' He also 
              quoted his 'mentor' Buddhist monk who said that the only chance 
              for peace in conflict situations was the mutual recognition of suffering 
              on both sides by people 'who are available on both sides'. 
            <p>Once again, there were clear parallels between the Holy Land and 
              Northern Ireland. In both cases religion and politics were intertwined 
              to the detriment of both-spirituality was polluted by political 
              ideology into some kind of nationalism, and politics were polluted 
              by uncompromising religious claims which fostered and condoned violence. 
              Religion then became another 'weapon' in the national arsenal. A 
              possible solution for the Holy Land lay in some sort of federation 
              of nations jointly sharing Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel 
              and Palestine, with religious freedom being guaranteed to all inhabitants 
              of the Holy City, as well as pilgrims from around the world. Prophetic 
              protest against injustice or violence or the abuse of our religious 
              tradition was necessary but it was insufficient for genuine peace 
              and reconciliation. The healing of hearts was also needed, transforming 
              fear to trust, anger to forgiveness and greed on both sides to compassion 
              for the sufferings of others. This process would require painful 
              sacrifice including the renunciation of territory, along with self-justifying 
              myths and self-images that fuel conflict. Those who would devote 
              themselves to peace-making would have to be priestly catalysts of 
              this sacrificial process. 
            <p>The 'Open House' peace centre was one such laboratory for peace. 
              The need generally was to engage the problems with creativity and 
              compassion. This would start with individuals-dedicated souls who 
              at some level were already 'at peace' and who embodied the presence 
              of transcendence. The micro-miracles of transformed individuals 
              once joined together in common vision, could generate macro-miracles, 
              on the scale witnessed in South Africa, and the former Communist 
              bloc. Such radical transformation was possible elsewhere also, we 
              only had to tap the human capacity to love and be loved, to forgive 
              and be forgiven. This is how God has graced each and every one of 
              us, and we were blessed to have this sacred foundation to build 
              on in our struggle for genuine reconciliation. Whatever our theologies 
              (and we could continue to argue about them, respectfully) this was 
              the challenge to us as believers in the Divine source of truth, 
              justice and peace. 
            <p>So ended two days of dynamic exchange and reflection, in which 
              realities and ideals came together and issued in qualified but insistent 
              hopes for a better future. The essential message seemed to be that 
              we need to face hard facts yet look boldly and faithfully for the 
              miracle of transcendence-that which is beyond the range, domain 
              or grasp of human reason, description and belief, but which by redemptive 
              grace and common faithfulness will make 'a different world' of a 
              'world of differences'! 
            <p>The success of this conference was in no small measure due to the 
              faithfulness and organisational skill of Sandy Martin and her colleagues 
              in the International Inter-faith Centre in Oxford, and Shaunaka 
              Rishi Das of the Northern Ireland Inter-Faith Forum, without whose 
              dedication this visionary event would neither have taken place nor 
              been so signally worthwhile.

                    <p>The Alchemical Body excavates and centres within its Indian 

                      context the lost tradition of the medieval Siddhas. Working 

                      from a body of previously unexplored alchemical sources, 

                      David Gordon White demonstrates for the first time that 

                      the medieval disciplines of Hindu alchemy and hatha-yoga 

                      were practised by the same people, and that they can only 

                      be understood when viewed together.&nbsp; White opens the 

                      way to a new and more comprehensive understanding of medieval 

                      Indian mysticism, within the broader context of South Asian 

                      Hinduism, Jainism and Islam.

                    <p>This book offers useful insights into the complex and internally 

                      diverse realm of Hinduism. It is intended to acquaint the 

                      reader with themes and issues that, while of relevance to 

                      all religious traditions and systems, contribute to an understanding 

                      of the abstract nature of Hinduism as a whole. Beginning 

                      with Hindu religious understandings of the human condition, 

                      the chapters are arranged so as to form a thematic survey 

                      and overview of Hindu religious beliefs and practices. The 

                      themes of morality and ethics, the role of women in Hinduism, 

                      the Hindu religious construction of nature, and issues such 

                      as mythology, the status of texts, forms of worship, and 

                      sacred time and place can be systematically considered; 

                      or, alternatively, focus can fall upon those topics that 

                      are of particular personal interest. Readers should find 

                      this book a wide-ranging and balanced introduction to Hinduism's 

                      inner diversity.</p>

                    <p>Written for students of comparative religion and the general

                    <p>What is one to make of a group of goddesses that includes 

                      a goddess who cuts her own head off, a goddess who sits 

                      on a corpse while pulling the tongue of a demon, or a goddess 

                      who prefers sex with corpses? Tantric Visions of the Divine 

                      Feminine deals with a group of ten Hindu Mahavidyas, who 

                      embody habits, attributes or identities usually considered 

                      repulsive or socially subversive.&nbsp; It is within the 

                      context of tantric worship that devotees seek to identify 

                      themselves with these forbidding goddesses.&nbsp; The Mahavidyas 

                      seem to function as 'awakeners' - symbols that help to project 

                      one's consciousness beyond the socially acceptable or predictable. 

                    <p>Kinsley not only describes the eccentric qualities of each 

                      of these goddesses but seeks to interpret the Mahavidyas 

                      as a group and to explain their importance for understanding 

                      Tantra and the Hindu tradition.

                    <p>No religion ever remains static: it affects and is in turn 

                      affected by material reality.&nbsp; It is the creative tension 

                      embodied in this dynamic which makes the world of religion, 

                      rich with possibilities. 

                    <p>This book examines the contours of this creative tension 

                      in the context of Hinduism in our own times. For Hinduism, 

                      a religion of unknown antiquity is also, in several ways, 

                      surprisingly modern. Hinduism for Our Times is an attempt 

                      to raise this dimension of Hinduism to an unprecedented 

                      level of self-awareness.&nbsp; Thus the choices that Hindus 

                      must make in the context of modernisation and globalisation 

                      become conscious as opposed to random choices, choices which 

                      will place Hinduism at the cutting edge of the contemporary 

                      world instead of consigning it to the periphery.&nbsp; This 

                      book will appeal to all those interested in giving religion 

                      a modern agenda.
