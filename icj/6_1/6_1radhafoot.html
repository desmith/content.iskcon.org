              <li><a name="9"></a>&nbsp;In his purports to the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>, 
                4.9.65-66, Shrila Prabhupada writes, 'Formerly this earth was 
                ruled by one saintly king only. Kings were trained to become saintly; 
                therefore they had no other concern than the welfare of the citizens. 
                . . Although it is <i>misconceived</i> that formerly the monarchical 
                government was autocratic, from the description of this verse 
                it appears that not only was King Uttanapada a rajarsi, but before 
                installing his beloved son Dhruva on the throne of the empire 
                of the world, he consulted his ministerial officers, considered 
                the opinion of the public, and also personally examined Dhruva's 
                character.' (Emphasis added.)<br>

              <li><a name="17"></a>As a society, ISKCON has failed to define the 
                meaning of the term 'Vedic.' To the extent the term means in line 
                with the purposes or teachings of the Vedas, ISKCON must more 
                clearly articulate how the Vedas describe women's roles. So far, 
                ISKCON spokespersons have failed to address the plurality of women's 
                roles described in our own texts, focusing only on one or two 
                examples from one or two women's stories. Currently, the term 
                has a more common usage as a substitute for the phrase 'vaguely 
                historical.' Women are often told that they cannot lead kirtan 
                or give Bhagavatam class, for instance, because it would not be 
                considered proper in 'Vedic' terms for them to do so, in spite 
                of examples of women in our own <i>sampradaya</i> who have done 
                so.<br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="18"></a>Shrila Prabhupada also mentions many times 
                that men in the current age of Kali yuga are less intelligent 
                than men in former ages. Thus, the question of whether the statements 
                about the relative intelligence of men and women apply at all 
                in this age remains undecided.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="19"></a>We should not entirely dismiss this concept 
                of protection, because women do have special circumstances that 
                require additional resources. In particular, women engaged in 
                child rearing have specialised needs which our entire society 
                ought to participate in satisfying.<br>

                the spring of 1992, I was informed by one male <i>pujari</i> (priest) 
                that the reason why there were so few women at the morning programme 
                was that the truly sincere <i>matajis</i> preferred staying chastely 
                at home to worshipping the Deities in the temple. I was also instructed 
                not to speak while taking prasadam and informed that women were 
                not permitted to speak in the prasadam hall. Thereafter, I took 
                my meals in the temple restaurant.<br>
