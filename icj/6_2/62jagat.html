            <p align=LEFT><i>Is ISKCON a Hindu religious movement? This very question 
              has caused a great deal of discussion both between members of the 
              ISKCON and those commenting on the Society from outside. Since ISKCON 
              is a unique product of the vision of one individual, A.C. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami, its founder, we must examine his position on this issue. 
              Central to the difficulties that commentators have had in coming 
              to any sort of decision are the seemingly ambiguous comments and 
              decisions that the founder made with regards to Hinduism and his 
              Society. There are times when he clearly stated that ISKCON was 
              not Hindu and that his followers should endeavour to keep themselves 
              apart from Hindu influences, and there were other times when be 
              clearly linked ISKCON to Hinduism. Jan K. Br explores the references 
              that Srila Prabhupada made to Hinduism, and more importantly he 
              discusses these comments within the context in which they were made, 
              thus enabling us to gain a clearer understanding of Srila Prabhupada's 
              position on Hinduism. </i> 
            <p align=CENTER><b>I.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT> One afternoon in October 1970, Srila Prabhupada visited 
              the Golden Temple in Amritsar. After touring the temple and seeing 
              the way in which food was distributed, he signed the temple's guestbook. 
              Under religion he wrote, 'Krsnaite' and under comments he wrote, 
              'Very spiritual' (<i>Lilamrta</i>, vol. 4, 137).<a

 href="jag3.html#e1">[1]</a> <a name="01"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (henceforth 
              Prabhupada) also sometimes jokingly called himself and his movement 
              Krsnian, a play on Christian, but neither Krsnaite nor Krsnian became 
              current, even though the institution he founded was named the International 
              Society for Krsna Consciousness. Popularly, of course, his followers 
              were known as the Hare Krsnas, a name to which Prabhupada did not 
              make an objection. Acknowledging his membership in the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya 
              or Gaudiya Vaisnava disciplic succession, he happily identified 
              himself as Gaudiya Vaisnava. However, his relationship with the 
              larger entity known as Hinduism was rather less clear. In fact, 
              he often overtly denied any connection to Hinduism at all: 'The 
              Krsna consciousness movement has nothing to do with the Hindu religion 
              or any system of religion' (SSR: 3). Another time he wrote: 'One 
              should clearly understand that the Krsna consciousness movement 
              is not preaching the so-called Hindu religion.' He could be even 
              stronger in his judgement of Hinduism, calling it 'a dead religion' 
              with 'no philosophy' (72-02-04.VAI) or 'a cheating religion' (731006BG.BOM). 
            <p>Prabhupada conceded on more than one occasion that Krsna consciousness 
              had its roots in Hinduism, but since in one place he compares it 
              to Buddhism it may be thought that he felt it was a new religion 
              growing out of the Hindu tradition, though entirely distinct from 
              it: 'You can call it Hinduism, but actually it does not belong to 
              any 'ism'. It is a science of understanding God, but it appears 
              to be like the Hindu religion. In that sense Buddhism is also the 
              Hindu religion because Lord Buddha was a Hindu' (750519RC.MEL). 
            <p>On the other hand, Prabhupada also expressed a deeper emotional 
              connection to Hinduism, such as in 1970 when he reacted to an article 
              in a Bombay newspaper. He felt he had been misrepresented as denying 
              Hinduism entirely by saying that 'Krsna is everything' (701104RC.BOM). 
              Accusing the reporter of making contradictory statements, he asked 
              how one who worships Radha-Krsna and follows Hindu ceremonies like 
              Rathayatra can say that 'Hinduism is nothing'? (701212RC.IND). His 
              identification of Rathayatra and Radha-Krsna worship with Hinduism 
              shows that he had not, in fact, made as sharp a break with that 
              tradition as the Buddha had done. 
            <p>In view of this apparently ambivalent attitude, an analysis of 
              Prabhupada's statements on Hinduism is needed to find out the relationship 
              between the religious movement he founded and its broader Hindu 
              heritage. This preliminary study is an attempt to summarise different 
              themes surrounding the terms 'Hindu' and 'Hinduism' as found in 
              Prabhupada's writings, letters, speeches and conversations. 
            <p

 align=CENTER><b>II.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada's fundamental discourse on Hinduism is standard 
              and oft-repeated. It customarily begins with a rejection of the 
              term 'Hindu' itself as a misnomer, describing it as an outsider's 
              term. This is, of course, accepted historical fact, though Prabhupada 
              suggests that it had a negative connotation for those outsiders: 
              'In India, according to the Vedic language, the Europeans are called 
              <i>mlecchas </i>or <i>yavanas. </i>Similarly, &quot;Hindu&quot; 
              is a name given by the Muslims' (SSR: 3).<a href="jag3.html#e2">[2]</a> 
              <a name="2"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Like every other scholar who has rehearsed the etymology 
              of the word 'Hindu' from Sindhu/Indus, Prabhupada does not deny 
              the existence of an entity which has come to be known by the name 
              Hinduism. Rather, he uses this discourse as an opportunity to establish 
              the true name of the religion which accepts the Vedic authority, 
              and from there to describe what he holds to be its authentic form. 
              Since Prabhupada's approach is prescriptive, his concept of Hinduism 
              is perhaps clearer than that of scholars who attempt to describe 
              it phenomenologically. In this respect he is similar to many other 
              Hindus who have accepted the term but have struggled to define it 
              in a satisfactory manner. 
            <p align=LEFT> Alternative names for the religious system which submits 
              to the Vedic authority and which Prabhupada finds preferable to 
              'Hinduism' are <i>sanatana-dharma, varnasrama dharma, </i>and <i>vaidika 
              dharma</i> or Vedic culture. However, Prabhupada contrasts or complements 
              these terms with the 'science of God', <i>bhagavata-dharma </i>or, 
              less frequently, <i>vaisnava-dharma</i>. It will be first of all 
              necessary to disentangle these terms in order to understand how 
              Prabhupada saw his movement in relation to the broader Hindu tradition. 
            <p>To contextualise this discussion of Prabhupada's use of the term 
              'Hindu', it is worthwhile examinining one or two definitions given 
              by others who have no qualms about calling themselves by that name. 
              I have selected the following two: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT> [A Hindu is one] who accepts the <i>Vedas</i>, the 
                <i>Smrtis, </i>the <i>Puranas </i>and the <i>Tantras </i>as the 
                basis of religion and the rule of conduct, and believes in one 
                supreme being (<i>Brahman </i>), in the law of retributive justice 
                (<i>karma</i>) and in Reincarnation (<i>punar janma</i>).<a href="jag3.html#e3">[3]</a> 
                <a name="03"></a> 
              <p align=LEFT>The main tenets of Hindu dharma are: belief in one 
                Supreme Principle-Brahman, accepting the authority of the Vedas, 
                the theory of <i>karma </i>and rebirth, values designated as <i>purusartha, 
                </i>the social organisation of <i>varna-asrama </i>and <i>jati, 
                </i>performance of rituals and practice of <i>samanya-dharma. 
                </i>It is essential to note that one can remain a Hindu even when 
                he rejects any one or all of these. It is really difficult to 
                point out any single essential attribute of a Hindu except the 
                ideal of universal fraternity.<a href="jag3.html#e4">[4</a><a name="04"></a><a href="jag3.html#e4">]</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The first of these definitions is wide enough to be 
              easily acceptable to Prabhupada, though he would no doubt wish to 
              nuance the word Brahman, who for him is the Para-Brahman, the Supreme 
              Personality of Godhead Krsna. The second definition, which is somewhat 
              narrower, would likely require more nuances on his part, but the 
              last two sentences clearly show that a Hindu would have had no trouble 
              in accepting Prabhupada as one. A question which needs to be asked 
              is whether Prabhupada would have accepted the same tolerant attitude 
              attributed to Hinduism and much vaunted by its proponents like Vivekananda. 
            <p align=CENTER><b>III.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT> Prabhupada does not use the term 'Vedic dharma' frequently.<a href="jag3.html#e5">[5]</a><a name="05"></a> 
              However, the word 'Vedic' itself and the necessity for the acceptance 
              of the Vedic scriptural authority comes up repeatedly. The use of 
              the word 'Vedic' by Prabhupada contains certain problems,<a

 href="jag3.html#e6">[6</a><a name="06"></a><a href="jag3.html#e6">]</a> but if 
              we recognise that like Srisa Basu (in the first definition above), 
              he means the entire field of Hindu literature by this term, then 
              he is in agreement with most Hindus.<a href="jag3.html#e7">[7</a><a name="07"></a><a href="jag3.html#e7">]</a> 
              Thus when Prabhupada says, 'Hinduism is accepting the Vedic authority' 
              (661226CC.NY), he is identifying himself with Hinduism. As a result 
              of such identification, he accepts even Sankaracarya, the great 
              teacher of the monistic doctrine and avowed rival of the Vaisnavas 
              because he based his arguments on the Vedic literature and reestablished 
              the Vedic authority (SB 1.3.24, 4.21.27; CC Madhya 25.91).<a

 href="jag3.html#e8">[8]</a> <a name="08"></a> 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Ultimately, the Mayavadi philosophers say that God, 
                the Supreme Absolute Truth, is impersonal, whereas the Vaisnava 
                philosophers say that in the end, the Absolute Truth is a person 
                and He, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is Krsna. <i> Krsnas 
                tu bhagavan svayam</i>. Each group sticks to its position and 
                they fight-'fight' means by philosophical arguments. That has 
                been going on for a very long time. However, both of them belong 
                to the <i>sanatana </i>Hindu <i>dharma </i>because both of them 
                will talk on the Vedanta philosophy. They can give differing interpretations, 
                but they cannot say that they don't accept Vedanta. If they do, 
                it is at once rejected. So one must give an interpretation on 
                the Vedanta philosophy to be accepted as <i>acarya </i>(661226CC.NY). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada also stressed that the <i>acaryas </i>and 
              disciplic successions which preserved their interpretations of these 
              revealed scriptures, played an essential role in characterising 
              and defining the Vedic-Hindu system: 'India's culture depends on 
              the <i>acaryas </i>like Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Sankaracarya, 
              Nimbarka, and Visnusvami. So in the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>it is said, 
              <i>acaryopasanam. </i>Anyone in India who claims to be a Hindu must 
              have followed an <i>acarya</i>' (740612RC.PAR). 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada repeats a countless number of times the statement 
              made in the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>that Krsna is the object of Vedic 
              knowledge-<i>vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah</i> (BG 15.15). Furthermore, 
              he clearly indicates in the conclusion to this statement, 'All the 
              <i>acaryas </i>accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' 
              So anyone who accepts the Vedic authority, in Prabhupada's understanding, 
              must accept the personal form of the Para-Brahman, Krsna. 
            <p align=CENTER><b>IV.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada frequently stresses that Krsna consciousness 
              is the science of self-realisation (indeed one of his books has 
              this concept as its title), by which he means that it teaches universal 
              principles of worshipping the Lord rather than sectarian dogmas 
              conditioned by time, place and culture. The first principle of this 
              science is that the self is distinct from the body. Thus Prabhupada 
              on one occasion said, 'Am I this body or something else? This is 
              the first question I was trying to answer, but some people in my 
              audience thought it was a kind of Hindu culture. It is not Hindu 
              culture. It is a scientific conception' (JSD: 1, 3). On the other 
              hand, this is the specific teaching of the Vedic literature: 'We 
              are not this body. This is self-realisation. That is Vedic culture' 
              (740628LE.MEL). 
            <p align=LEFT>For Prabhupada, knowledge has 'no colour' (740619RC.GER), 
              by which he means that knowledge is an objective truth and thus 
              not the monopoly of any religious denomination. One may follow any 
              religious scripture, he argues, but why should an individual who 
              is serious about God not accept the Krsna consciousness movement 
              if he or she can find further enlightenment there? He explained 
              this during an interview: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>This religious principle means to understand God. 
                Every religion is trying to understand God according to their 
                capacity . . . But the only difference is that we give details 
                so that modern minds advanced in education and <br>
                scientific knowledge can understand, whereas others cannot give 
                in such detail (680201IV.LA). 
            </ul>
            <p align=CENTER><b>V.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada most frequently offers <i>sanatana-dharma 
              </i>and <i>varnasrama-dharma </i>as more correct names for the religious 
              system which accepts Vedic authority. His discourses which accompany 
              these two terms suggest that he did not believe that they meant 
              the same thing; though he does occasionally present them as being 
              equivalent, his arguments are usually a refutation of the view commonly 
              held by many Hindus which directly equates the two. 
            <p align=LEFT>In his discourse on <i>sanatana-dharma, </i>Prabhupada 
              tends to break the term down into its component parts and discuss 
              their etymological meaning. Rather than simply translate the word 
              <i>dharma </i>as religion, he tends to analyse the etymology of 
              <i>dharma </i>from the root <i>dhr</i>, defining it as 'that which 
              sustains the living being' (SB 1.2.6P) or 'that which is constantly 
              existing with a particular object' (BG Introduction). Another meaning 
              is given as 'occupational duty': 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The word 'religion' is not a perfect translation of 
                the Sanskrit word <i>dharma. </i>Religion is a kind of faith which 
                we can change. But <i>dharma </i>means your occupational duty 
                which you cannot change; you have to execute it. What is our <i>dharma</i>? 
                What is our compulsory duty? I have several times analysed this 
                fact: our compulsory duty is to serve (690409SB.NY). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Thus <i>sanatana-dharma </i>can be construed as 'the 
              eternal quality of the living being' or his <i>nitya-svarupa, </i>which 
              in accordance with the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta </i>(Madhya 20.108) 
              is to be the eternal servant of Krsna. This eternal service may 
              be directly expressed and thus be liberating, or perverted into 
              service for some other object out of ignorance. 
            <p align=LEFT> For a further understanding of the word <i>sanatana 
              </i>('eternal'), Prabhupada refers to <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>where 
              it has been used three times as an adjective describing the individual 
              soul or jiva (15.7), the Supreme Lord (11.18) and the Lord's abode 
              (8.20). 'When these three <i>sanatanas </i>come together, that is 
              called <i>sanatana </i>life, and any process that takes us to that 
              <i>sanatana </i>position, that is called <i>sanatana-dharma</i>' 
              (730228LE.JKT). 
            <p align=LEFT>So <i> sanatana-dharma </i>means both the eternal constitutional 
              position of the jiva as a servant of God and the process by which 
              one realises that constitutional identity. Graham Schweig refers 
              to this usage of the word <i>dharma </i>by Prabhupada as having 
              the 'universal' sense of religion and as being an expression of 
              the unity of religion.<a href="jag3.html#e9">[9</a><a

 name="09"></a><a href="jag3.html#e9">]</a> For religions in the plural sense, 
              Prabhupada favours the term 'faith'. Since service to the divine 
              is the constitutional position of the living entity, Prabhupada 
              says on numerous occasions that to revive this eternal attitude 
              of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a science and 
              as such applicable to all, regardless of their colour, caste or 
              creed. It thus transcends Hinduism which here is equated with the 
              other world religions as a 'faith': 'Most of our Hindus call themselves 
              <i>sanatana-dharmi, </i>but <i>sanatana-dharma </i>is not limited 
              to any particular type of society. It is meant for all human beings, 
              all living entities' (730228LE.JKT).<a href="jag3.html#e10">[</a><a name="10"></a><a href="jag3.html#e10">10]</a> 
            <p align=CENTER><b>VI.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Quoted more than a 100 times throughout Prabhupada's 
              discourses and written works is Shrimad Bhagavatam 1.2.6: 'The supreme 
              occupation [<i>dharma</i>] for all humanity is that by which men 
              can attain to the loving service of the transcendent Lord.'<a href="jag3.html#e11">[11]</a> 
              <a name="11"></a> This verse was the guiding principle to Prabhupada's 
              analysis of religion: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The definition is: that principle of religion is the 
                best by which you can develop your devotion or love for the Supreme 
                Personality of Godhead. How nice this definition is, just try 
                to understand. You may follow Christianism or Hinduism or Buddhism 
                or Muhammadanism-it doesn't matter. The test is how far you have 
                developed love of God . . . If you have developed the sense of 
                love for God, then it is to be understood that you have actually 
                followed the religious principle (710826SB.LON). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada relegates religious systems which do not 
              strive for this ultimate goal to a lower level: '&quot;Hinduism&quot;, 
              &quot;Muslimism&quot; (sic) and &quot;Christianism&quot; (sic) are 
              all <i>prakrta, </i>mundane. But we have to transcend this <i>prakrta, 
              </i>or mundane conception of religion' (750320AR.CAL). By mundane 
              conceptions of religion, Prabhupada means that the aims of such 
              systems is restricted to the four goals of life or purusarthas, 
              which he sees as different levels of ego or sense gratification 
              (SB 1.1.2P). Prabhupada termed such religions which do not aim at 
              developing love for God as 'pseudo-religion' (BG 2.26P) and even 
              'cheating religion' on the basis of <i>dharmah projjhita-kaitavo'tra</i> 
              (SB 1.1.20). 
            <p align=LEFT>Another definition of religion (<i>dharma</i> ) is based 
              on a teaching from the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>,<i> dharmam tu saksad 
              bhagavat-pranitam</i> (6.3.19), was much favoured by Prabhupada: 
              'Religion means the codes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' 
              He compares these laws to those of the state: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Just like in the state, there is king's law. The king 
                gives you some laws, and if you are a good citizen, you obey those 
                laws and live peacefully. This is a crude example. Similarly, 
                <i>dharma </i>or religion means nothing other than to obey the 
                laws of God, though they may differ according to time, circumstances 
                and people (681020LE.BOS). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>So all bonafide religious systems are, according to 
              Prabhupada, God-given and can not be manufactured by human endeavours. 
              (731006BG.BOM). On the other hand, he states that 'Muhammadanism, 
              Hinduism, Christianism, all these &quot;isms&quot; are imperfect 
              and man-made', whereas 'this [Krsna-consciousness] is perfect because 
              it is given by God Himself'. The criterion is that 'if a religion 
              teaches ultimately surrender to God, then it is perfect religion. 
              Otherwise it is not religion' (BERGSON.SYA)<a href="jag3.html#e12">[12</a><a name="12"></a><a href="jag3.html#e12">]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada repeatedly denies that Krsna is a Hindu god. 
              He is God for all. He does not descend in his incarnation to revive 
              Hindu religion, but to revive the eternal religion which is surrender 
              to himself. 'When Krsna says that he comes to reestablish religion 
              (BG 4.8), it is not to reestablish Hinduism or Muslimism (sic) or 
              Christianism (sic). His purpose was to teach true religion, that 
              is, surrender unto Krsna. '<i>sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam 
              saranam vraja</i>' (731006BG.BOM). This absolute surrender then 
              is the ultimate law of God. 
            <p align=LEFT>Though other religious systems are considered to be 
              the products of time, circumstance and the people amongst whom they 
              were instituted, devotional service to Krsna even when executed 
              by an imperfect practitioner is considered by Prabhupada, in keeping 
              with the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>to be transcendental: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>When we are on the material platform, there are different 
                types of religions-Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, 
                and so on. These are instituted for a particular time, a particular 
                country or a particular person. Consequently there are differences. 
                Christian principles are different from Hindu principles, and 
                Hindu principles are different from Mohammedan and Buddhist principles. 
                These may be considered on the material platform, but when we 
                come to the platform of transcendental devotional service, there 
                are no such considerations. The transcendental service of the 
                Lord (<i>sadhana-bhakti</i>) is above these principles. The world 
                is anxious for religious unity, and that common platform can be 
                achieved in transcendental devotional service. This is the verdict 
                of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When one becomes a Vaisnava, he becomes 
                transcendental to all these limited considerations (CC Madhya 
                25.121P). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>That which is conceptualised as <i>sanatana-dharma </i>is 
              in practice given the name <i> Vaisnava-dharma </i>or <i>Bhagavata-dharma. 
              </i>Prabhupada does not use the term <i>Vaisnava-dharma </i>with 
              any frequency,<a href="jag3.html#e13">[</a><a name="13"></a><a href="jag3.html#e13">13]</a> 
              but following the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam, </i>gives preference to 
              the latter term. 
            <p align=LEFT>There are 375 references to the word <i>bhagavata-dharma 
              </i>in the database of Prabhupada's words. It is 'the process of 
              religion enunciated by the pure devotees, direct representatives 
              of the Supreme Personality of Godhead' (SB 6.16.41P) and is defined 
              variously as 'the activities of the devotees', 'the <i>sankirtana 
              </i>movement', 'the religion of glorifying the Lord and His devotees', 
              <i>bhakti, prema-dharma</i>, pure devotional service, 'the cult 
              of the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>'. As such it is the 'religious principles 
              in devotional service that transcend religious principles for liberation 
              and the mitigation of material misery' (SB 5.5 Summary), 'the religion 
              of surrender to the Supreme Lord and love for Him' (SB 6.3.20-12P). 
              It is 'the transcendental religion which is the eternal function 
              of the living being' (CC Adi 1.91P) and consists of 'chanting, dancing 
              and preaching the principles of the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>' (CC 
              Adi 7.41). 
            <p align=LEFT>In keeping with the definition of all religion as the 
              orders of the Supreme Lord, <i>bhagavata-dharma</i> also encourages 
              the social doctrine of <i>varnasrama-dharma </i>(SB 6.16.43P).
