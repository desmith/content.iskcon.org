              Thomas J. Hopkins</b></a> 
            <p align=LEFT><i>ISKCON began in 1965 and has since expanded into 
              a worldwide religion, but to date no comprehensive history of its 
              development, or systematic study of its teachings has been carried 
              out. The need for such studies have become more and more important 
              in the decades since Prabhupada's departure, but until recently 
              there has been no institutional centre to support them. Such a centre 
              has now been established in Oxford, England, and the foundation 
              has been laid for ISKCON members to begin collecting the data and 
              developing the scholarly resources needed to study their tradition. 
              In this article, Tom Hopkins argues a strong case for the need for 
              ISKCON's members to begin thinking seriously about what is needed 
              to carry out these tasks. </i> 
            <p>ISKCON's institutional history is now a little more than thirty 
              years old, if we consider A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's arrival in 
              America as the starting point. Within this time period, roughly 
              a generation long, we can see two clear stages: a dozen years of 
              dramatic success and worldwide expansion during Prabhupada's lifetime, 
              and a more ambiguous period of both successes and problems since 
              his death in 1977. In the first of these stages, the seed of ISKCON 
              was planted and a young and vigorous seedling grew under Prabhupada's 
              personal care; in the second stage, his followers have struggled 
              to cultivate and tend the growing plant that has propagated throughout 
              the world during the past two decades. 
            <p>Not surprisingly, it is the first stage the period of Prabhupada's 
              leadership and ISKCON's rapid growth that has received the greatest 
              attention from ISKCON members over the years. A wonderful biography 
              of Prabhupada has been written, journals of some of his early disciples 
              have been published, his formal talks and even his informal conversations 
              have been collected in several multi-volume series, and archives 
              have been established to preserve and publish his works in various 
              media. We probably know more about Prabhupada's life, works and 
              teachings than we do about the founder of any other religious movement 
              in history certainly more than we do about the Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, 
              or even Caitanya himself. 
            <p>The second stage of ISKCON's history is a very different matter. 
              It is, for one thing, a much more complex story to deal with. Instead 
              of a single major actor to follow with the spotlight of attention, 
              there are many different players acting at once in theatres around 
              the world. The drama being played out, moreover, is not as consistently 
              joyous as that of the earlier years. There are shadows on the stage, 
              dark passages in the story, and many examples of human frailty. 
              There is no longer an assumption that nothing can go wrong; the 
              joyous first act gives way to an often painful series of leadership 
              problems, organisational disputes and internal conflicts, and the 
              clouds of mundane human affairs and human weaknesses often obscure 
              the sun of Prabhupada's vision. There is a natural tendency, therefore, 
              to prefer to replay the first act and avoid looking too carefully 
              at what follows after the curtain closes on Prabhupada's departure. 
            <p>Yet however reasonable this may be, the avoidance of the more recent 
              past in favour of the halcyon days has had serious consequences 
              for ISKCON's self-understanding. It is clearly more pleasant to 
              recall the days with Prabhupada, and it is necessary to do so to 
              keep him always at the centre of ISKCON's life. It is now more than 
              twenty years since his death, however, and that is nearly two-thirds 
              of ISKCON's total history to date. Many important decisions have 
              been made during that period, many changes have occurred, and many 
              new developments have taken place. Some of what has happened has 
              been problematic and some has been painful, but much of it has been 
              very positive. Most importantly, ISKCON has survived a very difficult 
              stage in its development and is now healthier than it has been for 
              many years. How has this happened? What went wrong in the past, 
              and what responses were made that restored ISKCON's health? Without 
              understanding these issues, it will be hard to preserve that healthy 
              condition for the future. 
            <p>ISKCON is certainly not alone in facing such problems of self-understanding. 
              Every major religious tradition has had to deal with the transition 
              from its origins and founding figure to the more problem-fraught 
              period of new leadership and institutional development. Buddhism 
              faced this problem when the Buddha died, forcing his followers to 
              find new ways to preserve his teachings and maintain the monastic 
              community he had founded. The transition was not easy, as we learn 
              from the Buddhist texts produced over the next few centuries, but 
              generations of hard work and self-examination finally paid off: 
              scriptures were created to set forth the Buddha's teachings and 
              their implications, institutions were established to maintain monastic 
              discipline and serve the needs of householders, and new texts were 
              written to aid Buddhist self-understanding of how all this had come 
              about. Twenty-five centuries later, this early effort is still the 
              foundation of Buddhist life and practice. 
            <p>A better-known and even more relevant example is Christianity, 
              which faced internal conflicts even before anything called 'Christianity' 
              existed. Jesus' disciples were clearly confused about who he was 
              and what his teachings meant, they quarrelled among themselves about 
              the privileges they might gain when he came to power, and ultimately 
              one of them the infamous Judas betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities. 
              Peter, Jesus' most intimate disciple and 'the Rock' on whom the 
              later Church would stand, twice denied that he knew the arrested 
              Jesus or had ever followed him, and all of Jesus' disciples believed 
              that his story had ended when he died on the cross. Even after the 
              Resurrection, not all of Jesus' closest followers were able to accept 
              what had occurred, and the early emerging community of 'Christians' 
              or 'Nazarenes' struggled to understand what had happened and what 
              its consequences might be. A generation later, as we know from the 
              apostle Paul's New Testament Epistles to young churches, there was 
              widespread disagreement among Christian communities about matters 
              of fundamental faith and practice. Much of Paul's career, some thirty 
              or more years after the death of Jesus, was spent on doctrinal, 
              ritual, and organisational disputes that threatened to tear the 
              new church apart. 
            <p>How do we know about these problems in Buddhism and Christianity? 
              We know about them only because both religious traditions believed 
              it was important to face the disputes that had beset their early 
              years, describe the conflicts openly, and show how they had been 
              resolved. The same was true of Islam, where the death of the Prophet 
              ushered in a dispute about his successor that has affected Muslim 
              history down to the present day. Efforts to preserve the words of 
              Muhammad, moreover, led to numerous questions about which words 
              were truly his and when they had been uttered, and witnesses called 
              to resolve the disputes disagreed on the time and circumstances 
              of many sayings. Yet despite the anguish caused by such fundamental 
              disputes and by the sometimes dubious behaviour of those involved, 
              the early Muslim chroniclers believed it was essential to preserve 
              a record of what had happened. 
            <p>There is no doubt about the success of these three great world 
              religions. Buddhism is now well into its third millennium, Christianity 
              is approaching the end of its second millennium, and Islam is still 
              expanding into new areas more than thirteen centuries after Mohammed's 
              death. Clearly, they have prospered over the years despite their 
              difficult beginnings. It would be simplistic to credit their historical 
              awareness for all of their successes, but awareness of their early 
              problems was certainly a factor in overcoming later challenges. 
              One does not learn how to resolve problems if one denies them, and 
              in the oft-repeated maxim, those who ignore the past are doomed 
              to repeat it. Facing one's problems does not magically remove them, 
              of course, but it provides the opportunity to learn and grow stronger 
              through a better understanding of the past and a greater awareness 
              of present needs and possibilities. 
            <p>ISKCON as a continuation of Caitanya Vaishnavism is not a new religion, 
              but ISKCON as an institution at this point in time is still in the 
              first generation of Prabhupada's early disciples roughly at the 
              same point in time when Buddhism, Christianity and Islam had to 
              decide how to deal with their initial crises. It is natural that 
              all newly-founded religions would face such decisions at about the 
              same time: the memory of the founder is still strong, but those 
              who knew him personally are getting older and many new members have 
              never met him. New leadership has emerged, and their role vis-à-vis 
              the founder is still unclear in terms of the succession of authority: 
              who should be in charge now, and what is his or her right or perhaps 
              mandate to initiate new developments in changing circumstances? 
              The community of faithful has grown and faces new challenges, new 
              institutions and new organisational structures are needed, and new 
              opportunities can only be cultivated with new approaches. But who 
              is to make the needed decisions, and how can they be both faithful 
              to the founder's teachings and example and also open to the future? 
            <p>There is no single or simple way to answer these questions. Multiple 
              answers have been given even within the same tradition, sometimes 
              leading to splits within the community: Buddhism developed sects 
              or schools that differed in matters of doctrine and practice, Christian 
              unity was threatened by political and doctrinal disputes, and Islam 
              was permanently divided over the issue of leadership succession 
              after the Prophet's death. What is clear, however, is that these 
              religions would never have moved beyond the point of crisis if the 
              questions had been ignored or suppressed. It is hard to face internal 
              conflicts and challenges openly and boldly, but it is deadly for 
              the future of a young institution not to face them. 
            <p>ISKCON is very fortunate in this situation compared to most other 
              world religions. Most obviously, ISKCON possesses a body of its 
              founder's teachings that far surpasses that of any other religious 
              movement before modern times. Almost every word that Prabhupada 
              spoke was recorded on the spot, and everything he wrote has been 
              published. Buddhists by contrast struggled for generations to remember, 
              collect, and transmit over forty years of the Buddha's teachings 
              orally, with a further lapse of several centuries before they were 
              first written down. Early Christianity faced another kind of challenge, 
              because Jesus taught a group of newly-recruited disciples for only 
              a few short years before his crucifixion. Their differing backgrounds 
              and often conflicting agendas affected how they remembered what 
              Jesus had said, when or where he had said it, and what his sayings 
              meant. The result was three different official accounts of his life 
              and ministry (the three so-called 'Synoptic Gospels' ascribed to 
              Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and a fourth account, the Gospel of John, 
              which disagrees with the Synoptics in its portrayal of Jesus' life 
              and teachings. 
            <p>Early Muslims faced a somewhat different set of problems after 
              Mohammad's death. His ministry and revelations were soon codified 
              in the Koran with little dissension, but leadership of the Muslim 
              community was almost immediately in question. At issue, among other 
              things, was the content and meaning of what Muhammad had said on 
              different occasions about succession to his leadership, whom he 
              most trusted to carry out his wishes, and how the community should 
              conduct itself in matters of morality and law. After long debate, 
              Muslims decided to accept alternative versions or interpretations 
              of Mohammad's sayings (the Hadith) and to legitimise several separate 
              schools of law with different principles of authority. 
            <p>What these examples from Buddhist, Christian and Muslim history 
              show are that the period after the death of a founder is critical 
              in a religious movement. The continuation of the movement is at 
              stake at this point, because the overriding question is whether 
              it can make a successful transition from the founder's charismatic 
              leadership into an institutional form that will preserve the faith 
              over time. Central to this process, as these examples also show, 
              is preserving the message and example of the founder in as many 
              ways as possible. Buddhists did this by collecting, editing and 
              passing on orally all of the teachings of the Buddha that anyone 
              could remember along with his rules and directions for the monastic 
              community. Christians did it by preserving Jesus' teachings in a 
              collection of 'sayings' that eventually found their way into narratives 
              of Jesus' life, the three Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John, 
              which became the foundation documents for Christian faith and practice. 
              Muslims did it by memorising the Koran, the verbatim record of Mohammad's 
              visions and revelations, and by collecting soon after the Prophet's 
              death all of the various versions of his conversations with his 
              followers the so-called Hadith or 'Tradition'. 
            <p>ISKCON, as noted earlier, has already completed this stage of collecting 
              its founder's teaching well ahead of schedule thanks in part to 
              modern technology, but thanks also to the foresight of Prabhupada's 
              initial followers who started recording his words (and music) almost 
              from the beginning of his mission. There are no significant questions 
              in his case about what he said and where he said it, as there clearly 
              are in other religions. His teachings have been published in books, 
              magazines, records, videotapes and CD-ROMs, and are accessible to 
              anyone who wants to read, see or hear them. By analogy with other 
              religions, the canonical scriptures of ISKCON have been established 
              and the vital first stage in the transition has been successfully 
              completed. 
            <p>If we look further at other religions, however, we realise that 
              this is only the start of a long-term process. Founders are essential 
              to convey their personal example directly to their followers or 
              disciples, and scriptures are necessary to preserve the founder's 
              teachings for later generations. Without a living tradition, however, 
              both become antiquities. It is too soon to say that this has happened 
              to Prabhupada and his teachings, because ISKCON still has a direct 
              connection to Prabhupada through present disciples who were with 
              him for many years. There is a tendency in ISKCON today, however, 
              to look on Prabhupada and his teachings as a source of proof-texts 
              for ad-hoc policies and decisions rather than try to understand 
              him and the tradition in which he stood more systematically. In 
              what may seem a paradoxical way, it may be necessary to pay less 
              attention to specific statements that Prabhupada made in order to 
              preserve the vitality of what he stood for. Prabhupada himself was 
              constantly changing not in his essential beliefs and devotional 
              relation to Krishna, but in the decisions he made to meet new circumstances 
              and take advantage of new opportunities. Prabhupada was a living 
              person, and it was his personal application of devotional principles 
              that gave life to ISKCON rather than any one teaching or even the 
              whole body of his teachings. 
            <p>Nevertheless, it is his teachings and the memory of his living 
              presence that ISKCON now has to rely upon, along with and he would 
              certainly be the first to say this the guidance of Krishna, the 
              Divine Godhead. How does one use these properly to keep ISKCON a 
              vital tradition? The answer certainly is not to use them in bits 
              and pieces to support decisions made for more materialistic or egocentric 
              reasons. It is rather to approach Prabhupada, his teachings and 
              the tradition in which he stood the tradition of Caitanya Vaishnavism 
              as mediated through earlier scriptures and the teachings of Bhaktivinoda 
              Thakura and Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati in a more systematic manner 
              to provide a dialogue with the past on behalf of the future. 
            <p>The name for such a systematic approach is Theology, supplemented 
              by what Christians have long called Church History history, that 
              is to say, which assumes a divine basis for the institutions and 
              practices of the religious community but nonetheless undertakes 
              to study them as a part of human history. This is not to diminish 
              the importance of the scriptures, the founder or the continuing 
              divine guidance, but rather to take them all with the utmost seriousness 
              as the necessary foundation for the community's ongoing religious 
              life. The purpose of Theology and Church History or in this case, 
              ISKCON History is rather to maintain a continuous check of the present 
              against the core values and essential doctrines of the larger tradition 
              and the spirit of the founder. It is, in other words, to keep the 
              bright light of trained and devout attention on the way the Lord's 
              human agents are presenting His teachings and managing His affairs. 
            <p>ISKCON is now in a position to undertake such an effort, and needs 
              to do so while Prabhupada's influence is still so powerful in living 
              memory. The effort to create a theological tradition within ISKCON 
              has, in fact, already started, although there is so far no solid 
              institutional base to provide theological training and maintain 
              an active theological community. The Institute for Vaishnava Studies 
              is trying to develop such a base in the USA, and the Centre for 
              Vaishnava and Hindu Studies is working to establish a scholarly 
              base at Oxford that could contribute to this effort. There is widespread, 
              if not unanimous, support within ISKCON for developing a community 
              of scholar-devotees who could take on the theological task for the 
              movement, and this support should increase as more and more devotees 
              gain the necessary academic training. 
            <p>The study of ISKCON's history, however, has hardly begun within 
              ISKCON itself. Numerous scholars outside ISKCON have studied its 
              history, and some have done excellent work, however, non-devotees 
              have neither the personal understanding nor the factual information 
              to carry out a balanced study of ISKCON's institutional history. 
              This task awaits devotees who have the historical training and the 
              institutional support to carry out what will be even at this early 
              stage of ISKCON's development a difficult and time-consuming job 
              of collecting the world-wide data of ISKCON's expansion and evolution, 
              organising it systematically, and trying for the first time to provide 
              a comprehensive understanding of ISKCON's history. In the process, 
              if the job is done well, many of ISKCON's internal problems the 
              skeletons in its closet as it were will be made more evident. However, 
              this is why institutional history must be done, and why it should 
              be done by devotees who respect the movement and its members, even 
              if this means that they reveal ISKCON's defects along with its strengths. 
            <p>ISKCON should study its own history; this is to say, because it 
              needs to do so for its own health and self-understanding. This is 
              not a job to leave to outsiders, although they may provide scholarly 
              advice; it is a family job, to be done by devotees trained for the 
              task and conscious of the movement's needs as well as the obligations 
              of scholarship. ISKCON's history over the past three decades must 
              be studied with constant reference to what it could be, and should 
              be, on the basis of Prabhupada's fundamental principles, so that 
              strengths can be recognised and built upon, and mistakes can be 
              corrected before they cause future harm. This history must also 
              recognise the changing circumstances within which ISKCON is operating 
              now in comparison with the past, such as the presence of a worldwide 
              Hindu Diaspora that has given ISKCON a new ministry to Hindus abroad. 
              Moreover, it must be serious, sustained and a central part of ISKCON's 
              own programme of self-examination and self-improvement. 
            <p>Can this job be done? Certainly it can, if there is the will to 
              do it and the support within ISKCON to get it started, but it will 
              take time and commitment to put in place the needed theological 
              and historical resources, both human and material. In the meantime, 
              ISKCON members everywhere should begin thinking about what might 
              aid the process especially what records, documentation, personal 
              accounts and local histories are available to fill in the historical 
              record. Much valuable data has no doubt been lost over the years, 
              but devotees should now at least begin to pay more careful attention 
              to preserving the record of the past. It is a glorious past, and 
              it needs to be studied with all the evidence possible, warts and 
              all, if ISKCON is to remain worthy of Prabhupada's faith in its 
              future.
