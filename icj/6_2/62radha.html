            <p><i>As ISKCON looks to solidify its institutional machinery, it 
              will need to look very seriously, at the relationship between the 
              institution and its individual members. ISKCON is a young society 
              and is in the process of development towards maturity. Radha devi 
              dasi examines some of the problems that arise if the relationship 
              between the individual and the institution are not solidified in 
              a formal contract, she argues that every member of the society should 
              be secure and protected in their execution of service to the Society. 
              She presents a Bill of Rights for discussion that may begin the 
              process to help fulfil this purpose.</i> 
            <p>Everyone has an equal right to execute devotional service. That

              Srila Prabhupada<a href="#edn1">[1]</a><a name="_ednref1"></a> 
            <p>Oppression is not a spiritual phenomenon. Yet, the history of organised 
              religion abounds with examples of oppression in various forms at 
              various times. From early Christian martyrs to the Spanish Inquisition, 
              from the Salem witch trials to abuses of the caste system and the 
              treatment of 'untouchables' in India, there has always been a risk 
              of oppression in the name of God. 
            <p>Research shows that there are certain universal factors that cause 
              or contribute to oppression within institutions and nations, and 
              there is also firm evidence that legal structures in the form of 
              Human Rights can minimise the tendency toward oppression. For these 
              reasons, a Declaration of Fundamental Human Rights for the protection 
              of both the institution and the members of the society would benefit 
              the Society. 
            <p align=LEFT>Oppression is defined as an 'unjust or cruel exercise 
              of authority or power'.<a href="#edn2">[2]</a><a name="_ednref2"></a> 
              We must guard against oppressive behaviour in our society. We understand 
              as devotees, that oppression is a phenomenon of the Kali-yuga, the 
              age of quarrel and hypocrisy in which we now reside, rather than 
              being a symptom of religion. In fact, Srimad Bhagavatam predicts 
              that the age of Kali will be characterised by a lack of justice. 
              As H. H. Hridayananda Swami points out: 
            <p align=LEFT>Already in many nations justice is available only to 
              those who can pay and fight for it. In a civilised state, every 
              man, woman and child must have equal and rapid access to a fair 
              system of laws. In modern times we sometimes refer to this as Human 
              Rights. Certainly Human Rights are one of the more obvious casualties 
              of the age of Kali.<a href="#edn3">[3]</a><a name="_ednref3"></a> 
            <p>Unfortunately, many of us have has an opportunity to observe the 
              'unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power' within our Society. 
              Vulnerable groups, particularly women and children, have been neglected 
              and abused in numerous ways, which allegedly range from dismaying 
              to truly abominable. The purpose of this article is not to catalogue 
              or recount the various injustices that have been perpetrated by 
              individuals acting in the name of ISKCON. Although naming the abuse 
              is a vital step in eliminating the wrongs, that important task has 
              been and continues to be done in other places. 
            <p>However, we must go further than simply identifying the behaviours 
              we wish to change. To some extent, we have been naive in believing 
              that sincerity alone could rectify the abuses which we seek to eradicate. 
              We must address the underlying causes of the abuse if we are to 
              arrive at meaningful solutions. 
            <p align=LEFT>From a psychological point of view, oppression and other 
              forms of injustice spring from a separateness of vision that is 
              based on material conditioning. A necessary precondition to abusing 
              others is learning to see those others as fundamentally different 
              from oneself. The Srimad Bhagavatam, one of our main scriptures, 
              describes this phenomenon as <u>prthak-drstih</u>, which Srila Prabhupada 
              translates as 'the vision of duality'.<a href="#edn4">[4]</a><a name="_ednref4"></a> 
              In the related purport, Srila Prabhupada explains that this dual 
              vision is the result of material conditioning, which causes one 
              to identify with the body, rather than with one's identity as a 
              servant of Krishna. Perceptions based on body, Srila Prabhupada 
              writes, cause one to think in terms of 'my body, my wife, my child, 
              my home'. Such perceptions permit us to see others as objects of 
              our own enjoyment rather than as servants of the Lord. 
            <p align=LEFT>This ability to artificially separate oneself from others 
              is the root of oppression. Scholars have noted that one of the common 
              roots of racial, gender and animal oppression is the use of linguistic 
              devices that put the oppressed group into a different category from 
              the oppressor.<a href="#edn5">[5]</a><a name="_ednref5"></a> Carol 
              Adams writes that oppression involves a three-part cycle of objectification, 
              fragmentation and consumption; it is the first stage, objectification, 
              which begins the process of rationalising unjust treatment. <a href="#edn6">[6]</a><a name="_ednref6"></a> 
            <p>Animals are objectified by language that treats them as objects 
              rather than as living entities. For instance, we eat 'beef' rather 
              than 'cows'. This objectification permits us to avoid the truth 
              about our actions. The second stage, fragmentation, can be symbolic 
              or literal. In the case of animals, they are literally fragmented 
              in the butchering process. We then deal with 'chops' and 'joints' 
              rather than living creatures. We say 'I am having pork chops for 
              dinner' rather than 'I'm having a pig for dinner'. The final stage 
              of the process, consumption, occurs when we have so divorced ourselves 
              from the real identity of other beings that we can abuse them. This 
              abuse takes the form of literal consumption in the case of animals. 
            <p align=LEFT>These three processes may be more symbolic, but no less 
              harmful, in the case of humans. For instance, the Nazis successfully 
              objectified European Jews, convincing other European citizens that 
              the Jews did not deserve the protection of Civil Law because they 
              were less than human. The Nazis then used fragmentation to isolate 
              the Jews physically and psychologically from the rest of the population. 
              The Jews were then 'consumed' by the Nazis in the concentration 
              camps. Objectification begins a process which permits fragmentation, 
              both within society and on a concrete, individual level. The final 
              step in the cycle, consumption, occurs when the oppressed being 
              is seen as a mere possession for the enjoyment of the oppressor. 
              Such vision could support acts such as rape and murder.<a href="#edn7">[7]</a><a name="_ednref7"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>While ISKCON is a society founded on spiritual truth, 
              we are not exempt from material influences that plague other institutions. 
              In particular, we sometimes suffer from the same separateness of 
              vision that leads to oppression in the larger society: we witness 
              a separation of vision from the principles of our philosophy, to 
              our actual practice of faith. For instance, when we speak of the 
              society outside our own institution, we have our own jargon that 
              both isolates us and condemns those who are not members of our organisation. 
              Those outside our movement are called 'karmis', 'demons', 'melecchas' 
              and 'sudras'. We describe ourselves as 'devotees', 'Vaisnavas', 
              'devas' and 'brahmanas'.<a href="#edn8">[8]</a><a name="_ednref8"></a> 
              These labels shape our vision of others and ourselves in ways that 
              divide us from the very people we are trying to reach. 
            <p align=LEFT>Language is also used to marginalise those who oppose 
              the current power structure. For instance, anyone unsatisfied with 
              the local status quo can be labelled as 'in maya'.<a href="#edn9">[9]</a><a name="_ednref9"></a> 
              When one is 'in maya' one's integrity, intelligence and loyalty 
              to ISKCON are automatically suspect and many temple communities 
              feel no compunction regarding harsh or unfair treatment of someone 
              who is 'in maya'. It is ironic that many of the positions and policies 
              that are in favour today were dismissed as being 'in maya' ten years 
              ago. Moreover, we must not isolate ourselves from constructive reform, 
              otherwise those elements of our society that are marginalised will 
              resort to more disruptive methods of ensuring that their voices 
              are heard within the society. For this reason we must build the 
              institutional framework that allows all of our members to have their 
              voices heard and their needs met. A Bill of Rights for every member 
              is one of the first steps to meeting this objective. 
            <p align=LEFT>Similarly, our language divides male and female members 
              of our movement. When we say 'devotees and matajis,' (devotees and 
              mothers) as we frequently do, we place women in a category separate 
              from devotees. We may use or at least sanction by listening to others 
              use derogatory names for women such as 'witch,' 'Maya-devis'<a href="#edn10">[10]</a><a name="_ednref10"></a> 
              with 'no souls' and 'razor like hearts'. One of the most telling 
              examples of this phenomenon is found in Srila Prabhupada's Lilamrta 
              where the presence of devotees at one event is described by listing 
              the names of the men present and adding 'and their wives' at the 
              end to acknowledge the presence of the female attendees. Thus, in 
              one of the official histories of our movement, women have been, 
              at least at times, robbed of their individual identities. This use 
              of language , which in many cases is benignly motivated, facilitates 
              the dangerous process of objectification. 
            <p>Objectification poses a particular difficulty for religious organisations 
              seeking to eliminate oppressive behaviour. That difficulty is the 
              tendency of religious institutions to transform customary behaviour 
              into sacred behaviour. For instance, in many Christian churches 
              during the 1960s the use of musical instruments such as guitars 
              or drums, in preference to the traditional church organ, were viewed 
              as heretical, in spite of the fact that the Christian religion did 
              not prohibit the use of any particular musical instrument for worship. 
            <p align=LEFT>Similarly, women in ISKCON face enormous difficulties 
              in eliminating the 'women in the back' policy in some of our gender 
              segregated temple rooms in spite of the fact that ISKCON's original 
              policy permitted men and women to stand on different sides of the 
              temple room with equal access to the altar.<a href="#edn11">[11]</a><a name="_ednref11"></a> 
              Part of the resistance to changing that policy is the mistaken belief 
              that the 'women in the back' is the traditional policy when, in 
              fact, it is not a traditional practice in Vrndavan, India nor is 
              it the policy implemented by Srila Prabhupada. In ISKCON, as in 
              other religious institutions, unjust behaviour may be codified and 
              protected in the mistaken belief that such behaviour is spiritual. 
              Hence, the material process of objectification can pose a special 
              danger for religious institutions. 
            <p>I do not contend that we must always avoid distinctions between 
              groups, or that we cannot engage in evaluations of our members. 
              Such distinctions and evaluations are a necessary part of operating 
              an international organisation. However, I hold that we require some 
              structural limits on our power to distinguish and label. In the 
              absence of such limits, as we have discovered to our cost, power 
              can sometimes become abusive. 
            <p>Human rights provide one measure of protection from abuse of power. 
              While classification of people into different groups is a necessary 
              part of a social institution, the presence of certain fundamental 
              entitlements that are available equally to everyone will help to 
              prevent classification from becoming objectification and oppression. 
            <p align=LEFT>Fundamental Human Rights are entirely consistent with 
              Vaisnava philosophy. Srila Prabhupada himself recognised the existence 
              of universal rights. In fact, he went so far as to stress that there 
              are certain rights belonging to both human and non-human living 
              entities. In a lecture he gave in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 
              1975, Srila Prabhupada told his followers that all living entities 
              have a birthright to use sufficient economic resources to maintain 
              life. He said that a failure to understand this right springs from 
              material conditioning.<a href="#edn12">[12]</a><a name="_ednref12"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Srila Prabhupada also taught that human beings have 
              equal spiritual rights to opportunities for advancing in the service 
              of Krsna. The Gaudiya Math, the institution in which Srila Prabhupada 
              took initiation, has been considered controversial for preaching 
              a doctrine that holds that those born in varnas (social positions) 
              outside brahminical society can be given brahmana initiation. Srila 
              Prabhupada was criticised by spiritual practitioners in India who 
              held that non-Indians could never become brahmanas. In defence of 
              his practise of initiating non-Indians, Srila Prabhupada said that 
              all living entities have a right to serve Krsna and to make advancement 
              in Krsna consciousness. In a lecture he gave in Toronto, Canada 
              in 1976, Srila Prabhupada told his disciples that these rights apply 
              to both female and male disciples.<a href="#edn13">[13]</a><a name="_ednref13"></a> 
            <p>Thus, it is not the existence of fundamental Human Rights that 
              are at issue in ISKCON, but the nature of those rights. Nor can 
              we ignore, however, the practical effects of the policies we adopt. 
              The type of rights we integrate into our social fabric will have 
              a profound impact on the type of society we form. 
            <p align=LEFT>Systems of governance that do not grant Human Rights, 
              however well intentioned, are systems with little accountability. 
              Adding Human Rights to a system of governance creates a standard 
              against which a leader's conduct can be measured. Human rights are 
              a codification of a leader's duties to his or her followers and 
              help to hold that leader accountable for his actions. Open societies 
              in which rights are granted are more stable and productive societies 
              with less conflict, and with less behaviour that is destructive 
              to other groups and to the environment as a whole than are societies 
              that fail to grant such rights.<a href="#edn14">[14]</a><a name="_ednref14"></a> 
              Adopting a declaration of Human Rights will help ISKCON to become 
              a more productive and stable society. 
            <p>A system of fundamental Human Rights is consistent with a spiritual 
              philosophy based on surrender. In fact, surrender, submission and 
              humility are internal qualities that cannot be legislated. Any attempt 
              to use institutional structures to impose the external appearance 
              of these qualities would result in oppression as well as foolish 
              and ineffective policy. 
            <p align=LEFT>Srila Prabhupada's descriptions of submission and surrender 
              clarify the voluntary nature of these qualities. In these descriptions 
              Srila Prabhupada explains that devotees can offer their submission 
              to Krsna in three ways. He writes that one can surrender by offering 
              prayers, humbly submitting oneself or by desiring some stage of 
              perfection.<a href="#edn15">[15]</a><a name="_ednref15"></a> All 
              three of these processes are voluntary. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada 
              often cited Arjuna's voluntary surrender to Krsna in the second 
              chapter of the Bhagavad Gita as the perfect example of the quality 
              of submission. His words make clear that submission is an internal 
              quality that transforms the attitude and external behaviour of an 
              individual and has to be cultivated by each member. For this reason 
              submission cannot be legislated by our society. Hence, the grant 
              of Human Rights is consistent with the spiritual qualities we seek 
              to acquire. 
            <p>The Declaration of Fundamental Human Rights which follows is a 
              proposal intended to begin discussion on this issue. No one person 
              can define the rights that our society should adopt. However, it 
              is my hope that the members of ISKCON can work together to create 
              institutional safeguards which will protect us from the mistakes 
              we have made in the past. Rights to participate freely in the activities 
              of our society are essential to creating the vital and productive 
              society that will be most pleasing to Srila Prabhupada. 
            <p align=left><b>DECLARATION OF MEMBERS' RIGHTS FOR THE<br>
              INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS</b> 
            <p>Whereas, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and 
              inalienable rights of all living beings is a fundamental tenet of 
              Vaisnava philosophy; 
            <p>Whereas, compassion and mercy are essential qualities of Vaisnavas; 
            <p>Whereas disregard and contempt for the rights of living beings 
              have resulted in injurious acts (both inside and outside the Hare 
              Krishna Movement) which outrage the conscience of all compassionate 
              beings; and 
            <p>Whereas it is essential to the continued existence of ISKCON that 
              we promote loving relations between all Vaisnavas and Vaisnavis; 
            <p>Now therefore, we adopt the following Bill of Rights for all of 
              the members of ISKCON: 
            <p><b>Article 1<br>
              </b>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
              They are all members of Krishna's family endowed with reason and 
              conscience and should act toward one another in a spirit of love 
              and compassion. 
            <p><b>Article 2<br>
              </b>Membership in ISKCON is available to all people who desire such 
              membership and who agree to the conditions of such membership. No 
              one shall be denied membership in ISKCON on the basis of race, national 
              or social origin, language, birth status or gender. 
            <p><b>Article 3<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON is entitled to all the rights and freedoms 
              set forth in this Declaration, without distinction on the basis 
              of race, national or social origin, language, birth status, age, 
              gender, or identity of the member's initiating guru as long as that 
              guru is authorised by ISKCON to give initiation. 
            <p><b>Article 4<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON has the right to freedom from violence, 
              torture, cruel or degrading treatment and abuse. It is the duty 
              of ISKCON leaders to provide environments that are free from violence, 
              torture, cruel or degrading treatment and abuse. 
            <p><b>Article 5<br>
              </b>ISKCON is a voluntary society and no member of ISKCON shall 
              be held in a condition of involuntary service. 
            <p><b>Article 6<br>
              </b>All members of ISKCON are equal before the law and are entitled 
              without any discrimination to equal protection of the laws which 
              govern our society. 
            <p><b>Article 7<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON has the right to an effective remedy 
              by ISKCON's Governing Body Commission (GBC) for acts violating the 
              fundamental rights granted him or her under this Declaration. 
            <p><b>Article 8<br>
              </b>No member of ISKCON shall be subjected to any arbitrary sanction 
              or punishment by any ISKCON authority. 
            <p><b>Article 9<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON is entitled in full equality to a fair 
              hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination 
              of his or her rights and obligations in relationship to ISKCON. 
            <p><b>Article 10<br>
              </b>No member of ISKCON shall have his or her membership rights 
              in ISKCON limited or terminated without a full and fair hearing 
              by an independent and impartial tribunal. It is essential to such 
              a full and fair hearing that the accused ISKCON member be given 
              (a) reasonable notice of the hearing, (b) the opportunity to present 
              witnesses and evidence on his or her own behalf, and (c) the opportunity 
              to confront the witnesses and evidence against him or her. 
            <p><b>Article 11<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON shall have the right to freedom of movement 
              and residence. Every temple dependent resident member shall have 
              the right to leave his or her temple ashrama for the purpose of 
              establishing his own separate residence at any time. However, any 
              ISKCON member who seeks residence in a temple ashrama must abide 
              by the rules of that ashram, including the rules of admission to 
              that ashram. 
            <p><b>Article 12</b> 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Every member of ISKCON who is of full legal age, without any 
                limitation due to race, national or social origin, language, birth 
                status, gender or religion, shall have the right to marry and 
                to found a family.<br>
                <br>
                Both male and female members of ISKCON are entitled to equal rights 
                under ISKCON and secular law as to marriage, during marriage and 
                at its dissolution. However, this article does not itself create 
                any right to dissolve a marriage.</li>
              <li>Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent 
                of the intending spouses.</li>
              <li>The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society 
                and is entitled to protection by ISKCON. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Article 13<br>
              </b>Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. 
              It is the duty of ISKCON leaders to provide protection to the women 
              and children in their area. It is also the duty of ISKCON leaders 
              to provide resources and programmes for the development and enrichment 
              of the children in ISKCON. 
            <p><b>Article 14<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON shall have the right to freedom of thought 
              and conscience. While ISKCON leaders may place reasonable restrictions 
              on a member's public expression of ideas which conflict with ISKCON's 
              position, no member of ISKCON shall be sanctioned for ideas or beliefs 
              which differ from official ISKCON positions or for ideas or beliefs 
              which contradict those of ISKCON leaders. However, this provision 
              shall not prevent ISKCON from requiring that its members ascribe 
              to ISKCON's official positions in order to hold leadership positions. 
            <p><b>Article 15<br>
              </b>Every member of ISKCON shall be entitled to such education and 
              service opportunities as will assist his or her full development 
              in Krsna consciousness without discrimination on the basis of race, 
              national or social origin, language, birth status, gender, or identity 
              of the member's initiating guru as long as that guru is authorised 
              by ISKCON to give initiation. 
            <p><b>Article 16<br>
              </b>Every temple dependent resident member of ISKCON shall be entitled 
              to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of 
              himself or herself and his or her family, including food, clothing, 
              housing and medical care, rest, and necessary social services, and 
              the right to security in the event of, sickness, disability, widowhood, 
              old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his 
              control. 
            <p>While ISKCON leaders are not responsible for the standard of living 
              of non-temple dependent members of ISKCON, they have a duty to foster 
              the development of necessary economic support skills among the members 
              in their care and to avoid setting policies which would interfere 
              with the ability of non-temple dependent members to provide an adequate 
              standard of living for themselves and their families. 
            <p><b>Article 17<br>
              </b>Each member of ISKCON shall have the right to information about 
              the process by which ISKCON is governed and, in particular, shall 
              be entitled to information about: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>the nature and content of proposals made at each annual Mayapur 
                meeting of the GBC;</li>
              <li>the identification of those proposals which are adopted at each 
                annual Mayapur meeting of the GBC; and </li>
              <li>the nature and outcome of formal disciplinary proceedings undertaken 
                by ISKCON authorities against ISKCON leaders;</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Article 18<br>
              </b>In the exercise of his or her rights and freedoms, each member 
              of ISKCON shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined 
              by ISKCON leaders to be essential for the purpose of securing recognition 
              and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting 
              the just requirements of morality, public order and the general 
              welfare of ISKCON.
