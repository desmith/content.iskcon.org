            <p align=LEFT>In the first chapter of <i>Hindu Wisdom for all God's 
              Children</i>, Francis X. Clooney states 'No encounter with another 
              religion very different from my own can be fruitful unless I explore 
              my own self'.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Clooney suggests, this is not a book 
              for 'mere spectators' but is an open invitation for the reader to 
              become actively involved by reflection on personal insights and 
              experiences. 
            <p>In his book, Clooney introduces readers to the spiritual riches 
              of Hinduism, drawing on his own experiences whilst teaching at a 
              Jesuit college in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1950s.&nbsp; Through 
              this Clooney learned to respect and appreciate the traditions and 
              practices of Hinduism which in turn led to a better understanding 
              of his own faith. 
            <p align=LEFT>The book consists of seven chapters, each exploring 
              a different theme.&nbsp; Through the use of stories, poems and nuggets 
              of information drawn from a generous scoop of Hindu traditions, 
              Clooney eases the reader into the heart of Hindu thought and feeling. 
              The reader is taken through the development of his deepening understanding 
              of his own faith by exploring the many facets of the Hindu faiththe 
              reader experiences his journey as he dips into Hindu understanding 
              and then returning to his own faith with deepened insight and understanding. 
            <p>In the first chapter he uses the creation myth from the Brhadaranyaka 
              Upanishad, a largely unknown Indian text, which reflects on the 
              basic Hindu thinking behind such things as creativity and awareness 
              of the one true self which are still influential today; in the second 
              he concludes that to learn religion, be it one's own or a different 
              faith, one must necessarily come to self-knowledge; in third chapter 
              he seemingly departs from the Hindu tradition to tell the story 
              of the Buddha's search for enlightenment although, as he explains, 
              it is only by recognising the important contribution that the Buddha 
              made to India's perception of life and death, freedom and bondage, 
              that one can begin to understand the wisdom of Hindu philosophy.&nbsp; 
              In the following three chapters Clooney returns to the more traditional 
              roots of Hinduism, focusing on the desire to see God face to face, 
              and how devotion to Krishna is regarded by many Hindus as the fulfilment 
              of this wish; the need to accept the contradictory of nature of 
              God as destroyer as well as creator, symbolised by Shiva, and the 
              perception of God as the source of all life. In chapter six 'Mother 
              of the Universe', he uses the image of the Goddess in the Sanskrit 
              text entitled 'Ocean of Beauty' to illustrate the Hindu belief that 
              God is also Mother, and that it is only by becoming aware of the 
              world around us that we begin the climb towards full spiritual understanding. 
              In the final chapter, Clooney proposes that in the search for God, 
              one may look no further than our neighbour, or indeed ourselves. 
              To illustrate this point, he draws on the writings of Mahatma Gandhi 
              and Mahasweta Devi, who through their experiences in working with 
              India's poor and disadvantaged souls, and their encounters with 
              harsh truths and violence, discovered a greater understanding of 
              the subtle interconnections between self, non-violence, truth and 
              God.&nbsp; Clooney sums up his own realisations by emphasising the 
              need for individuals to contemplate how God has acted in their lives 
              thus far, in order to comprehend what He is showing them in their 
              lives at present. The author suggests, in order to fully appreciate 
              the true nature of God, one has to experience life to its fullest 
              extent, unhampered by personal fears or prejudices, and that the 
              attainment of self-knowledge is only possible with a mind open to 
              the wisdom to be found in other religions. 
            <p align=LEFT>In <i>Hindu Wisdom for all God's Children</i>, Clooney's 
              insights appear to stem from his own spiritual vitality that seems 
              to breed openness to deeper religious experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Rather than focusing on tedious philosophical arguments, Clooney 
              concentrates on personal realisationsnot only his own but also those 
              experiences by others.&nbsp; His conclusion that 'religious traditions 
              stand in complementary to one another, they do not flourish if kept 
              rigidly apart; perhaps we need one another to remain alive' is perhaps 
              one of the most profound, and considered perspectives on the case 
              for interfaith dialogue that I have ever encountered.
