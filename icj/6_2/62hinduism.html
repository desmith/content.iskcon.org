            <p align=LEFT><b>Author: Kim Knott <br>
              Publisher: Oxford University Press: Oxford 1998 <br>
              ISBN 0-19-285341-4 <br>

            <p align=LEFT> Kim Knott makes a difficult subject interesting and 
              accessible in Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction; she employs a 
              style of writing that is both simple and informal, easily drawing 
              the reader into the topics and debates that are discussed in the 
              book. 
            <p align=LEFT>There is a refreshing air of frankness about the author's 
              approach to the key issues that constitute Hinduism. The author 
              explains the various perspectives from which one can view the subject, 
              making an important point that many introductory books overlookthat 
              one's understanding and perception of Hinduism largely depends on 
              whether one is a practitioner of that faith or not. This equally 
              applies to those writing the books and those reading the books. 
              Hindu practitioners writing about Hinduism will undoubtedly wish 
              to encourage spiritual understanding, and the Hindu reader is more 
              likely to be looking for specific cultural and religious content 
              for more personal reasons, while scholarly writers and readers will 
              require informative background and analytical comment. She also 
              points out that there is another type of reader who is neither looking 
              for conversion nor analysis, but is merely interested in finding 
              out more about the subject. There is something for all of these 
              readers in this presentation. 
            <p align=LEFT>This book is perhaps most successful in communicating 
              to the complete newcomer to studying Hinduism, and for them the 
              author makes the subject matter less daunting by the sparing use 
              of unfamiliar vocabulary needed to understand the basics of Hindu 
              custom and belief, though the basics such as brahmanism, <i>karma</i>, 
              re-incarnation, Vedanta, <i>bhakti</i> and <i>dharma</i> are well 
              explained. The author gently prompts the reader to think about the 
              personal perspective that they will bring to the subject, and this 
              is the perhaps the most useful accomplishment of the bookonce the 
              reader is taken through this experience of Hinduism they are bound 
              to have further developed their understanding of the issues facing 
              Hindus today, because of a of their own self-analysis. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Kim Knott's gentle introduction of the major debates 
              within Hinduism such as the Aryan Invasion Theory provides a good 
              introduction to the development of Hinduism and the debate surrounding 
              its origins. The author also usefully takes the various images of 
              Hindu tradition and places them in the context of both historical 
              background and demonstrates the implications they have for Hindus 
              today. In addition, she clearly explains the issues underlying both 
              practical and social Hinduism, such as knowledge transmission, describing 
              the ancient practice of handing down knowledge from guru to disciple, 
              the difficulties typically faced by Hindu immigrants attempting 
              to pass on this knowledge in culturally alien settings, and highlighting 
              the principal scriptures in which this knowledge is contained. The 
              book also serves as a good starting point for Hindus who are not 
              living in India and want to research and understand their culture, 
              for them it is invaluable for painting a general picture without 
              being biased towards a certain tradition within Hinduism. 
            <p align=LEFT> With the aid of anecdotes, illustrations, maps and 
              excerpts from scripture, plays and poems, the author presents her 
              information thematically, emphasising the concept and importance 
              of the divine presence in Hindu philosophy; drawing on the heroes 
              of epic literature such as the <i>Ramayana</i> and <i>Mahabharata</i> 
              to give an insight into influential figures in the lives of Hindus 
              and debating the issues involved in transplanting the Hindu culture 
              and tradition into an alien environment. 
            <p

 align=LEFT>Both accessible and enjoyable, this would be an ideal book for someone 
              who knows little or nothing about Hinduism. The book is long enough 
              to adequately introduce the subject, though not so lengthy that 
              it will deter them from 'dipping in'.
