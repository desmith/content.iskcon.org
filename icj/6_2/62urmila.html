            <p align=LEFT><i>The individuality of the self is a central teaching 
              in Vaisnava philosophy, but what is our practical understanding 
              of this term? Individuality is present in all living beings on both 
              a material and a spiritual level. This article translates how this 
              concept needs to relate to education practices in ISKCON today. 
              The author explores evidence in some of Srila Prabhupada' writings 
              and scripture that deal with the issue of individuality together 
              with some more recent research by academics in the field. With this 
              data, the author builds a persuasive argument for devotees to become 
              more aware of the individual, both in themselves and in others so 
              that they may respond with respectful awareness to the individuals 
              needs.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>Every living being is a separate and uniquely distinct 
              individual. The Vaishnava scriptures, such as the Bhagavad-gita, 
              teach us that this individuality is present on three different levels: 
              from the physical appearance of a person, to the subtle level which 
              is made up of the mind, intelligence and ego, and also more profoundly, 
              on a spiritual level the spiritual identity of a soul is also unique 
              and individual. Members of ISKCON have a strong understanding of 
              uniqueness in spiritual identity of an individual soul, as this 
              is one of the major teachings of our tradition. Unfortunately, the 
              individual uniqueness of a person on a material level (body and 
              subtle elements) is often overshadowed by our understanding and 
              emphasis of the spiritual ideal. <br>
              <br>
              The need to respond to the needs of a separate and unique individual 
              is an everyday issue for the students and teachers that work in 
              the Society's schools. We need to respond to this need more comprehensively 
              through raising awareness in our teachers. There are a number of 
              well-researched systems that have been put forward by various academics 
              which may be useful for teachers. These will be examined in more 
              detail together with references to the Vaisnava scriptures in the 
              demarcation of personality types. There will also be a few suggestions 
              as to how these concepts can be put to practical use by the teachers 
              in our movement. <br>
              <br>
              A good education system in Krsna consciousness must show respect 
              for individuality, first by recognising differences as inherent 
              and value-neutral. The failure either to recognise the existence 
              of distinct personality types or to accept them as value-neutral 
              lead to various problems to the development of an individual or 
              a society, one of the most damaging of which is an understanding 
              that spiritual perfection is an adjustment of material personality. 
              Teachers must then learn to establish a rapport with students based 
              on this understanding, and respect and adjust their teaching methods 
              accordingly to give useful direction for vocation and spiritual 
              service that will be in harmony with each individual's nature. We 
              can then go beyond respecting individuality, to glorifying diversity 
              as a means of pleasing the Lord.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Gaudiya Vaisnava position on individuality<br>
              </b>The soul, according to Vaishnava theology, is not simply 'light' 
              or existence, it is, in fact, an individual living entity which 
              has an individual relationship with God. When Krsna tells Arjuna, 
              'Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these 
              kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be', <a href="#e1">[1]</a> 
              <a name="1"></a>the Lord is directly referring to the unending nature 
              of individuality and the immortality of the soul. Srila Prabhupada 
              comments, 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual 
              person, and Arjuna, the Lord's eternal associate, and all the kings 
              assembled there are individual eternal persons . . . <a href="#e2">[2]</a> 
              <a name="2"></a>The individuality, to which Lord Krsna and Srila 
              Prabhupada refer to in these examples, means that each soul is a 
              separate and distinct being with an individual relationship with 
              God, and these relationships have been described in the scriptures. 
              <br>
              <br>
              One of the first broad categories of distinctions of spiritually 
              liberated souls is that of their rasa, or relationship, with the 
              Lord.<a href="#e3">[3]</a> <a name="3"></a>According to the various 
              divisions and gradations of devotees, permanent devotional situations 
              can be divided into five categories: peacefulness, service to Krsna, 
              friendship with Krsna, parental affection toward Krsna, and conjugal 
              love for Krsna. Each division has its own different taste and relish, 
              and a devotee situated in a particular division is happy in that 
              position. <a href="#e4">[4]</a> <a name="4"></a>So one aspect of 
              spiritual individuality is seen in that one perfected soul relates 
              to the Lord as a friend, whereas another perfected soul relates 
              to the Lord as their master, and yet another perfected soul relates 
              to the Lord as their worshippable Deity.<br>
              <br>
              However, even within these five categories, there is great scope 
              for individual expression; it is not that all those who view the 
              Lord as their intimate friend are alike in their mood of friendship, 
              or even alike in their personality. The Bhagavatam, one of our main 
              scriptures, relates a story where the demigod Brahma steals not 
              only Lord Krishna's calves but steals His cowherd boy associates 
              well. Krsna then expands Himself into replicas of each of those 
              boys and calves. It is described that each boy and each calf appeared 
              with their own individual characteristics and personalities and 
              appearance, so Lord Krishna had to replicate each boy and calf with 
              all of these differences.<a href="#e5">[5]</a> <a name="5"></a>This 
              is a good example to demonstrate that the Lord actually enjoys variety, 
              as each of these boys and calves has an individual relationship 
              with the Lord due to their individual personalities.<br>
              <br>
              Krsna delights in experiencing a variety of relationships with individuals. 
              So, does the Lord have a preference? Many devotees and scholars 
              have analysed the spiritual variety described in the scriptures 
              in terms of 'higher' and 'lower'. While such an analysis has validity, 
              it is also true that in Krsna's eyes, and in the vision of the devotee 
              of Krsna, all types are good, and wanted. Srila Prabhupada would 
              often say, 'Variety is the mother of enjoyment.'<br>
              <br>
              In the material world the specifics of our original identity with 
              the Lord are hidden, as we have not only been given a material body, 
              but also a subtle mentality as well. Even though we are not aware 
              of our eternal spiritual rasas with the Lord (unless we are on an 
              elevated spiritual platform), we are still aware that each of us 
              has unique body and mind. Even if we observe identical twins, they 
              are never exact copies of one another; each has a unique personality. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When dealing with the issue of personality types, and individuality 
              it is helpful to use certain categorisations for the purpose of 
              analysis. It is common to hear criticism, even outrage, whenever 
              one attempts to demarcate personality types. One hears accusations 
              such as that one is trying to 'label' or 'pigeonhole' people. Presumably, 
              the assumption is that labels for personality types, especially 
              broad labels, are an insult to the very individuality they are meant 
              to honour. Yet, broad descriptions have value, not only for a theoretical, 
              academic purpose, but also as a tool for understanding others and 
              ourselves in the context of our practical interpersonal dealings. 
              Properly understood labels broaden rather than narrow our view, 
              bringing us to a deep and genuine respect for one another.<br>
              <br>
              It is acknowledged though, that as each person is a unique blend 
              of characteristics, categorisation can give a broad idea of a personality.<br>
              <br>
              If we look to one of our main scriptures, the Bhagavat-gita, Lord 
              Krsna Himself categorises people. In fact, we will first consider 
              His categories. Krsna names the categories of personality as follows; 
              'Brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras are distinguished by the 
              qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material 
              modes.'<a href="#e6">[6]</a> <a name="6"></a>Brahmanas are the priestly 
              class, ksatriyas are warriors, vaisyas are the business community 
              and the sudras are the manual workers in Society. It is important 
              to note that these are understood differently to the modern context 
              of the term 'castes', which is delineated in terms of race, ethnicity, 
              or birth in a higher or lower social group. Rather, Krsna speaks 
              of an individual's personal 'qualities' and 'nature'.<br>
              <br>
              It is common for those who study personality types to conclude that 
              much of our type is 'inborn'. This is in line with Prabhupda's translation 
              that indicates that these four groups have an 'inborn' nature (Srila 
              Prabhupada writes, 'born of their own nature'). Dr. Rohm, for example, 
              writes that we are different 'by design' and that we are 'wired' 
              to be a particular style.<a href="#e7">[7]</a> <a name="7"></a>If 
              we accept this as fact, then each of us is born with a strong tendency 
              toward a particular type of personality. We find all the above personality 
              types represented in all races and cultures in the world, for all 
              must exist in order to have a heterogeneous society<br>
              <br>
              To return to the four divisions of individual natures as described 
              in our scriptures, Krsna continues in the Bhagavad-gita to describe 
              the psychology of the brahmanas. He says, 'Peacefulness, self-control, 
              austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness 
              these are the natural qualities by which the brahmanas work.'<a href="#e8">[8]</a> 
              <a name="8"></a>In the Bhagavatam, a similar description is given. 
              The symptoms of a brahmana are control of the mind, control of the 
              senses, austerity and penance, cleanliness, satisfaction, forgiveness, 
              simplicity, knowledge, mercy, truthfulness, and complete surrender 
              to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<a href="#e9">[9]</a><a name="9"></a><br>
              <br>
              The ksatriya's nature is defined as heroism, power, determination, 
              resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership.<a href="#e10">[10]</a> 
              <a name="10"></a>To be influential in battle, unconquerable, patient, 
              challenging and charitable, to control the bodily necessities, to 
              be forgiving, to be attached to the brahminical nature and to be 
              always jolly and truthful these are the symptoms of the ksatriya.<a href="#e11">[11]</a><a

 name="11"></a><br>
              <br>
              The vaisya being always devoted to the demigods, the spiritual master 
              and the Supreme Lord; endeavouring for advancement in religious 
              principles, economic development and sense gratification; believing 
              in the words of the spiritual master and scripture; and always endeavouring 
              with expertise in earning money these are the symptoms of the vaisya.<a href="#e12">[12]</a><a name="12"></a><br>
              <br>
              The qualities that are the hallmarks of the sudra are offering obeisances 
              to the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas, being always very clean, 
              being free from duplicity, serving one's master, performing sacrifices 
              without uttering mantras, not stealing, always speaking the truth 
              and giving all protection to the cows and brahmanas--these are the 
              symptoms of the sudra.<a href="#e13">[13]</a><a name="13"></a><br>
              <br>
              Brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra also known as the four varnas 
              can be defined in terms of an individual's situation in what the 
              Bhagavad-gita terms the 'modes' of nature. Those modes are termed 
              goodness, passion and ignorance. Each of the four varnas will gravitate 
              towards one or more of these modes. The relationship between the 
              three modes and the varnas is a vast topic and for the purpose of 
              this discussion, it is sufficient to note that a person's alignment 
              with these modes is another indication of his or her varna. Very 
              briefly, the brahmanas are situated in the mode of goodness, the 
              ksatriyas are situated in the mode of passion, the vaisyas are situated 
              in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the sudras are 
              situated in the mode of ignorance in terms of material nature.<a href="#e14">[14]</a> 
              <a name="14"></a><br>
              <br>
              Acceptance of the personality types described in the Bhagavad- gita 
              and Bhagavatam do not preclude the validity of some of the classifications 
              which modern researchers have developed. Sometimes modern academic 
              classifications will simply be described in different terminology 
              to those of the Vaisnava scriptures. At other times, personality 
              classifications will be a wholly different way of defining individuality. 
              Below are a few examples of various theories in personality types. 
              They are not presented as the definitive models by which teachers 
              in ISKCON should base their work, but they are presented simply 
              to show that several empirically verifiable models exist which have 
              practical application for teachers. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Models for classifying personality types<br>
              </b>The first model is one originally proposed by psychologist, 
              Dr. Howard Gardner. The seven types are linguistic, logical-mathematical, 
              spatial, musical, bodily-kinaesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal. 
              Recently, those who use this system in education have added a category 
              of 'spiritual'. Gardner stresses that most people are a blend of 
              strengths and weaknesses in several of these areas.<a href="#e15">[15]</a><a name="15"></a><br>
              <br>
              Those with linguistic 'intelligence' have highly developed auditory 
              skills. They like to read, write and tell stories. Their memory 
              is good, as is their spelling, and they take pleasure in solving 
              puzzles involving words. The logical-mathematical type thinks in 
              concepts, patterns and categories. They are capable of abstract 
              logical thinking and are concerned with philosophical questions. 
              Those with spatial 'intelligence' can think well in images and pictures. 
              They love to draw, design things and build. The musical type often 
              remembers by putting information into melody and can discern subtle 
              differences in music that they hear. The bodily-kinaesthetic 'intelligence' 
              is demarcated by physical restlessness, and either fine-motor co-ordination 
              or abilities in activities such as sports and dance. Those of the 
              interpersonal type understand other people, and tend to have positions 
              of leadership. They enjoy and are good at anything that involves 
              relationships between people. The interpersonal 'intelligence' types 
              are aware of their own feelings and motives. They often like to 
              work alone and have a sense of independence or strong will. They 
              can motivate themselves, have strong opinions, and are generally 
              self-confident.<a href="#e16">[16]</a><a name="16"></a> <br>
              <br>
              We now turn to the categories which psychological researcher Howard 
              Witkin used when conducting experiments for the US Navy. He was 
              seeking to understand why some pilots would fly out of a cloudbank 
              upside-down. He concluded that there are two broad ways in which 
              people gain an understanding of the world: global and analytic. 
              Most people are capable of both types of understanding, but will 
              rely more on one of the two. The analytic types like things ordered 
              step-by-step, observe details, value facts over feelings, want to 
              concentrate on one thing at a time, are self-motivated, rarely become 
              personally or emotionally involved, and may miss the main idea while 
              grasping the facts. The global type is sensitive to others' feelings, 
              flexible, needs reassurance and reinforcement, takes criticism personally, 
              avoids competition and may skip steps and details.<a href="#e17">[17]</a><a name="17"></a><br>
              <br>
              Yet, another way of demarcating personality types is the model that 
              Dr. Anthony F. Gregorc developed. His concern was mostly in the 
              area of the different ways that people process information, although 
              his definitions of types overlap areas of interpersonal interaction, 
              vocational preferences, and so forth. His research has shown that 
              people are primarily concerned with either concrete or abstract 
              information, and then organise this information either sequentially 
              or randomly.<a href="#e18"> [18]</a> <a name="18"></a>Taking all 
              combinations of these mental organisational systems, we can classify 
              four personality types: the concrete-sequential, abstract sequential, 
              abstract random, and concrete random. Again, most human beings can, 
              and to a certain extent do, function in each of these four ways<br>
              <br>
              The concrete sequential's general qualities are that he or she is 
              hardworking, conventional, accurate, stable, dependable, consistent, 
              factual, and organised. They may have difficulty working in groups, 
              in a disorganised environment, with incomplete instructions, and 
              with demands to use their imaginations. The abstract sequential's 
              general qualities are those of being analytic, objective, knowledgeable, 
              thorough, structured, logical, deliberate and systematic. Their 
              difficulties are with not enough time for research, repetitive tasks, 
              many specific rules, 'sentimentality', and being diplomatic. Abstract 
              randoms are categorised by being sensitive, compassionate, perceptive, 
              imaginative, idealistic, sentimental, spontaneous and flexible. 
              Their challenges are in the areas of having to explain their feelings, 
              competition, giving exact details, accepting criticism, or focusing 
              on one thing at a time. The qualities of concrete randoms are to 
              be quick, intuitive, curious, realistic, creative, innovative, instinctive 
              and adventurous. They struggle with restrictions, formal reports, 
              routines, fixing something after it has been done, keeping detailed 
              records, and having no options.<a href="#e19">[19]</a><a name="19"></a><br>
              <br>
              Dr. W. Lee Carter has analysed six personality types-oppositional, 
              sensitive, anxious, depressed, self-centred, and deceitful.<a href="#e20">[20]</a> 
              <a name="20"></a>The difficulty with his understanding is that he 
              focuses on the negative aspects of these types, which is reflected 
              even in the labels he assigns to them. There is little guidance 
              as to how the 'negative' qualities can be applied as strengths. 
              <br>
              <br>
              There is also the Barbe-Swassing model of modalities-does a person 
              learn and remember primarily through auditory, visual, or kinaesthetic 
              channels? The 'modality' model for understanding varieties of human 
              behaviour is of great importance to the educator, as it addresses 
              how each of us best assimilate and store information. Fortunately, 
              although most of us have a predominant strategy for the order and 
              circumstances where we use each modality, we can learn and remember 
              in various ways. However, some people have such a strongly dominant 
              mode that learning in other ways may be difficult. Individuals with 
              such an intensely dominant modality will have describable patterns 
              of learning, and, often, behaviour.<br>
              <br>
              Finally, the model put forward by Dr. Robert Rohm is particularly 
              well developed.<a href="#e21">[21]</a> <a name="21"></a>He and other 
              researchers such as Charles Boyd, have extensively applied their 
              research to educational applications, and perhaps most importantly, 
              he defines each type in terms of tendencies that can be either useful 
              or harmful to the person depending on the use and direction of those 
              inclinations.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Rohm first categorises people as primarily outgoing-fast-paced-or 
              reserved-slow-paced. Those who are fast-paced generally have the 
              following attributes: confidence, ingenuity, like learning new skills, 
              work in bursts of energy, are future-oriented, have more enthusiasm 
              than patience, and are interested in results. Those who are slow-paced 
              generally have the following characteristics: questioning attitude, 
              like using skills already learned, work steadily at an even pace, 
              are present-oriented, have more patience than enthusiasm, are fine. 
              <a href="#e22">[22]</a><a name="22"></a> <br>
              <br>
              Within each broad category of fast and slow-paced, are those who 
              are primarily task oriented and those who are primarily people oriented. 
              The general characteristics of the primarily task oriented are: 
              they value logic over emotions, are truthful rather than tactful, 
              question conclusions, can live without harmony, make decisions impersonally, 
              are firm-minded, guard their emotions, are more decisive than curious, 
              and take pleasure in finishing projects. Those who are primarily 
              people oriented have these general tendencies: they value emotions 
              and traditions over logic, are tactful rather than truthful, have 
              strong relational abilities, accept conclusions, desire harmony, 
              live according to the moment, are more curious than decisive, and 
              take pleasure in starting projects.<a href="#e23">[23]</a><a name="23"></a><br>
              <br>
              By combining the above categories, we arrive at four basic personality 
              types. There are the fast-paced task oriented people, the fast-paced 
              people oriented people, the slow-paced task oriented people and 
              the slow-paced people oriented people.<br>
              <br>
              Those who are fast-paced and task oriented tend to be strong-willed, 
              determined, independent, optimistic, practical, productive, decisive, 
              a leader, and confident if they use their tendencies for good purposes. 
              If they use their tendencies improperly, they are likely to be angry, 
              cruel, sarcastic, domineering, inconsiderate, proud, crafty and 
              unemotional.<a href="#e24">[24]</a><a name="24"></a><br>
              <br>
              The people oriented fast-paced person who uses his or her tendencies 
              well will be friendly, compassionate, carefree, talkative, enthusiastic, 
              personable, and fun. When those qualities are used improperly, they 
              will be weak-willed, unstable, undisciplined, restless, loud, undependable, 
              egocentric, exaggerative and fearful.<a href="#e25"> [25]</a><a name="25"></a><br>
              <br>
              A people oriented and slow-paced individual's well-used tendencies 
              will include being calm, dependable, easygoing, trustworthy, efficient, 
              practical, conservative, diplomatic, and humorous. Improperly used, 
              the qualities of this type will be stingy, fearful, indecisive, 
              spectator, self-protective, unmotivated, selfish, timid, and shy.<a href="#e26">[26]</a><a name="26"></a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              The slow-paced, task oriented person's tendencies when used well 
              will include being gifted, analytical, sensitive, perfectionist, 
              aesthetic, idealistic, loyal, self-sacrificing, and thorough. When 
              used improperly, such people will be self-centred, moody, critical, 
              negative, rigid, theoretical, impractical, unsociable and revengeful.<a href="#e27">[27]</a><a name="27"></a><br>
              <br>
              What of the differences in the physical appearances of an individual? 
              Of course, we have the two broad distinctions of male and female. 
              Some people are stronger and more athletically/physically able than 
              others, some are healthy and some not, and so on. The differences 
              of gender and physical ability are also certainly part of an individual's 
              material inclinations such as their way of learning and vocational 
              aptitude. Finally, the culture, or cultures in which we grow up 
              also has a great influence on how we exhibit our personality to 
              others.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Practical application for understanding others<br>
              </b>Suppose all the above methods of classifying personality are 
              rejected because we do not want to classify people into types, wishing 
              to relate to, and deal with, one individual in exactly the same 
              way we do others. We may think that everyone is basically the same-or 
              ought to be the same. When we do perceive differences, we will then 
              evaluate against a fixed set of criteria. Charles Boyd writes, 'I 
              have yet to meet a person who does not 'put labels' on people. When 
              you meet someone, for example, you make a quick evaluation of him 
              . . . You size up his look, his personality, his intelligence, and 
              how he makes you feel. If you're mature, you'll adjust your evaluation 
              as you get to know this person.' <a href="#e28">[28]</a> <a name="28"></a>So, 
              we are always evaluating-but perhaps only in comparison to some 
              'ideal' or ourselves.<br>
              <br>
              A practical example of this is my observation of two women that 
              were living in the same temple accommodation. One was outgoing and 
              people-oriented while the other was reserved and task-oriented. 
              Each thought that there was something very wrong with the other. 
              They saw each other as inconsiderate, either uncaring or too pushy 
              about the physical environment. Another example is that of a young 
              man who was content to do rather simple and repetitive tasks in 
              the service of the Lord. When he would be called upon to explain 
              why he wished to live as a devotee of Krsna, he would simply explain 
              how much happiness there is in Krsna consciousness. I would sometimes 
              hear others remark that this young man was foolish, and, others 
              felt that this man's spiritual life would not last if he did not 
              quickly became more philosophically learned.<br>
              <br>
              In both of these examples, people were making judgements of 'good' 
              and 'bad', both in relation to materially and spiritually desirable 
              qualities, using the positive aspects of their own individual type 
              as an absolute criteria. In other words, if I am courageous and 
              heroic, ready to take all personal risk to right the wrongs of society, 
              I may see someone with a more peaceful, forgiving, and tolerant 
              nature as weak and useless. The other person may in turn see me 
              as conceited and reckless. The Sanskrit term for such narrow-minded 
              thinking is atmavan manyate jagat, or 'everyone thinks of others 
              according to his own position'<a href="#e29"> [29]</a>, <a name="29"></a>or 
              in other words, 'I see others against the criteria of my own qualities, 
              which I consider as good qualities.'<br>
              <br>
              If one does not acknowledge the existence of various types of personalities 
              as being fixed and value-neutral, they may have the opposite difficulty, 
              thinking that everyone should be more like himself or herself. He 
              or she may think a type very unlike him or herself to be the ideal. 
              A person then strives to change one's basic innate nature, rather 
              than to utilise one's nature in the service of the Lord. Such an 
              attempt is generally useless, as the individual will never achieve 
              the 'ideal' goal, which is in their imagination because their innate 
              nature and talents are incompatible for achieving this ideal personality. 
              This is acknowledged by Lord Krsna as he points out that, 'Even 
              a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone 
              follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes. What can 
              repression accomplish? <a href="#e30">[30]</a><a name="30"></a>Compelled 
              by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same.' 
              <a href="#e31">[31]</a><a name="31"></a><br>
              <br>
              If one who thinks that spiritual advancement, or even becoming a 
              materially 'better' person, means changing their personality, then 
              this person will surely be frustrated. He or she will also be wasting 
              valuable time and energy that could be used to enhance and utilise 
              his or her own personality type for a good cause. It is even more 
              dangerous to present only one 'ideal' personality type for a devotee 
              of the Lord. In an extreme case a person may even reject spiritual 
              life as irrelevant if they do not perceive success for themselves 
              in becoming the 'ideal' personality type for a devotee. It is more 
              healthy and philosophically correct rather, for an individual to 
              render service to the Lord according to their innate natures, and 
              from these activities every individual can become perfect: 'By worship 
              of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all pervading, 
              a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.<a href="#e32">[32]</a> 
              <a name="32"></a><br>
              <br>
              Categorisation into superficial and unhelpful personality types 
              is another problem that arises when there is a failure to recognise 
              that there are many varieties of personalities. Unhelpful categories 
              are those that are taken as the total description of what the person 
              is, or should be, for example, those relating to age, gender or 
              race are particularly unhelpful; We can illustrate this further 
              with an example of personality categorisation according to gender. 
              If all women are expected, for example, to be a particular personality 
              type such as that they all should have a sudra mentality (suggesting 
              low intelligence) or, they should all be concrete-sequential, or 
              slow-paced people oriented, then women who do not fit into the assumed 
              'correct' behaviour pattern would be classed as deviant to the expectation 
              of that society, clearly creating many problems. Some of these problems 
              would be that that society would attract only a certain type of 
              woman who naturally had these personality traits, those already 
              part of that society with different natures to the accepted personality 
              would either feel alienated or attempt to artificially change their 
              natures to the expected ideal they would not be able to simply be 
              themselves. Similar examples can be drawn from racial perspective. 
              If a society classed all oriental people as a business orientated 
              and only accepted them if they fitted this categorisation, then 
              clearly there would be a section of the oriental community which 
              would not be accepted in that society. <br>
              <br>
              Empirical research has shown that, whichever of the above model, 
              one uses, there is not an equal distribution of personality types 
              in the population in general. For example, in Dr. Rohm's model only 
              10% of the population are predominantly fast-paced and task oriented. 
              On at least one occasion, Srila Prabhupada described the ideal society 
              as containing 5% brahmanas.<a href="#e33">[33]</a><a name="33"></a> 
              In the Gregorc model, the smallest group in the population is the 
              abstract-sequential, though interestingly there is virtually an 
              even distribution of each personality type within all models, across 
              gender and cultural lines. <br>
              <br>
              The final difficulty we will consider, that arises when we fail 
              to acknowledge individuality, is intolerance for differences in 
              opinion. We are not referring to differences of opinion about the 
              Vaisnava siddhanta, the ultimate goal of life or the Absolute Truth. 
              Rather, we are considering differences of opinion when considering 
              how to accomplish a goal, the order of priorities that we take and 
              the 'right' and 'wrong' with the actions taken in a particular situation. 
              Srila Prabhupada explained that: <br>
              <br>
              So far as your question about controversy amongst the disciples 
              . . . that is a fact. But this controversy is not material. Just 
              like in a national program, different political parties are sometimes 
              in conflict and make propaganda against each other, but their central 
              point is always service to the country. Similarly, amongst the disciples 
              . . . there may be some controversy, but the central point is how 
              to preach the mission of His Divine Grace. If the central point 
              is fixed up then there is no harm in such controversy. Every individual 
              being must have his opinion; that is the significance of individuality, 
              but all such differences of opinions must coincide in Krishna. In 
              the battlefield of Kuruksetra were Arjuna and Bhisma who were fighting 
              with one another, and because Krishna was on the side of Arjuna, 
              sometimes Bhisma pierced the body of Krishna also with arrows. But 
              still they remained the greatest devotees of the Lord.'<a href="#e34">

              <b>Individuality and the teacher<br>
              </b>In order to respect individuality in education, we need to understand 
              that individual uniqueness is an integral feature of reality, both 
              in the material and spiritual worlds. We cannot make everyone the 
              same, and as illustrated earlier, this is the opposite to the desires 
              of Lord Krishna as he enjoys variety. We also need to accept that 
              the innate material characteristics of an individual cannot change 
              in this lifetime. Further, all varieties of personality are neutral, 
              with the possibility of application for good or ill, spiritual advancement 
              or material degradation. <br>
              <br>
              After accepting the above values, we can demonstrate our respect 
              for the individual practically when we work with their nature rather 
              than against it. We can do this if we first recognise our own nature, 
              and, seeing both our strengths and weaknesses, make an action plan 
              for turning our inclinations to good purposes. In a similar way 
              we can teach and relate to others in a more constructive way if 
              we adjust to their individual motivating forces and self-perceptions. 
              Cynthia Tobias lists five stages that one goes through when understanding 
              individual differences. The first is awareness that there are fundamentally 
              different types of people. The second may be to think our style 
              is best. The third stage is appreciation of others, realising that 
              diversity is necessary for balance in society. Fourth, one may make 
              excuses based on the limitations of one's own nature. And, finally, 
              one can learn to adjust one's style to meet the needs of others 
              that think and act quite differently.<a href="#e35">[35]</a><a name="35"></a><br>
              <br>
              We can also develop understanding and rapport with others by knowing 
              enough about their personality to understand how they experience 
              the world, without which we cannot teach them, or be taught ourselves. 
              We adjust our methods of teaching and explanation to the needs of 
              the student, his or her modalities of learning, ways of intellectual 
              processing or interpersonal dealings, or all three. The specifics 
              of how to adjust according to these considerations are a vast topic 
              beyond the scope of this essay. It is sufficient to say that a good 
              teacher can and will adjust to the student. At the same time, giving 
              a good education requires that we teach our students how to adjust 
              as well, as the world will rarely come to meet them on their terms. 
              Instruction on how to adjust their style is carried out with the 
              idea that their style is wrong, or deficient and that we must 'fix' 
              them. Instead, we must know how to be helpful, and this necessarily 
              means that the emphasis is on the teacher to adjust if we wish to 
              give the student a beneficial education.<br>
              <br>
              In the field of vocational training, teachers need to guide students 
              to a career that will resonate with the student's tendencies and 
              thus bring the individual satisfaction and contentment in their 
              lives. Varieties of vocations are meant not only to accommodate 
              various talents and propensities, but also tend to a balanced society. 
              If we look at it in Vaishnava spiritual terms different vocations 
              are not meant for the gratification of either the individual or 
              society, but for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, Krsna. Our duties 
              will only truly satisfy ourselves when they satisfy the Lord. <br>
              <br>
              If we understand personality through the models presented in the 
              Bagavad-gita, the corresponding vocational direction becomes easier, 
              as in that model personal qualities and work are closely entwined. 
              Those with brahminical qualities work as priests, teachers, physicians, 
              scholars, astrologers and government advisors. Ksatriyas administer 
              governments and serve in the military. Vaisyas have work related 
              to farming, business and trade. And sudras work in manual labour, 
              entertainment, crafts and as general assistants to the other three 
              types in society.<br>
              <br>
              The concept of matching individual personality types to suitable 
              vocations is not unheard of in academic research. From the other 
              models discussed earlier. Each model of personality classifications 
              described earlier also have vocations that naturally fit them; for 
              example, the concrete random would be well suited for creative and 
              innovative work, and the abstract sequential for intellectual pursuits, 
              among other occupations.<br>
              <br>
              For devotees of Krsna, vocation indicates not only one's means of 
              earning one's livelihood, but also the way one serves the Lord. 
              There are services to the Lord that are purely on the spiritual 
              platform and are equally available to everyone, regardless of personality 
              from any angle of vision. These are services such as hearing about 
              the Lord, chanting His name and His glories, remembering Him, and 
              so on. However, when it comes to whether one should manage a temple 
              or a temple garden, be a renunciate or get married we should look 
              not at what is considered 'best' in absolute or theoretical terms, 
              but rather what is best for the individual according to his or her 
              nature.<br>
              <br>
              Probably the most significant advantage of respecting individuality 
              for the educator is the ability to encourage everyone as a devotee 
              of Krsna. For example, when a student prefers to talk and be with 
              friends rather than concentrate on his or her work, do we see him 
              as distracted and lazy, or people oriented? When a student wants 
              extra details for assignments, do we see him or her as picky or 
              analytical? Similarly we can view the qualities of students in two 
              ways, there are almost always two sides to any personal quality, 
              and it is an important responsibility for the teacher to guide a 
              student to utilise their personal characteristics for a positive 
              purpose. A teacher can see every 'fault' as a potential good quality 
              that simply needs the right direction and environment to manifest 
              properly. And, as every type of person has a contribution to make 
              in the Lord's service, we can encourage the development of an ability 
              to make a contribution that is in accord with one's nature.<br>
              <br>
              Understanding the nature of others is fundamental to good teaching 
              practice. Without this understanding it is impossible to guide them 
              in their vocation and service. How is that understanding accomplished? 
              Formerly, determination of varna was established by the spiritual 
              master observing the student's qualities and studying their astrological 
              chart. Unfortunately, this facility is not available to most of 
              us now, yet we can still guide others based on our observation of 
              their qualities. Of course, there are many modern tests to determine 
              personality and corresponding vocation according to various models, 
              and such tests may be helpful as long as they are used as with other 
              guides rather than the sole determining factor. Information on this 
              subject should also be gathered from the Vaisnava scriptures for 
              this. <br>
              <br>
              To say that our educational system needs to be founded on respect 
              for individuality does not go far enough. We need to learn to see 
              ourselves honestly, and then engage our strengths while compensating 
              for our weaknesses if we can attempt to do this we need not envy 
              nor disparage other personality types in our schools and temples. 
              We need to honour, glorify and teach students in consideration of 
              both theirs, and our own, individual characteristics. <br>
