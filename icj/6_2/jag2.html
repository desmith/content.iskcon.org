            <p align=CENTER><b>VII.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT> We have seen how Prabhupada defined <i>sanatana-dharma, 
              </i>or eternal service to God, as the true religion as well as the 
              true goal of the Vedic authority. In this sense he has given it 
              the name <i>Bhagavata-dharma </i>and called it the most perfect 
              conception of religion, the pure love of God. It is the scientific 
              process whereby one develops love of God or <i>prema. </i>In this 
              particular discourse, the great religions of the world are seen 
              as bodily designations, or at best '<i>Vaisnava-dharma</i> in a 
              crude form' (750314RC.TEH).<a href="jag3.html#e14">[14]</a> <a name="14"></a> 
              He calls them 'faiths' to distinguish them from this pure religion 
              of love and service to God. However, Prabhupada's analysis of religion 
              does not end here. 
            <p align=LEFT>A favoured theme in Prabhupada's discourse is that human 
              life means religion. <i>Dharmena hinah paSubhih samanah</i> (731006BG.BOM). 
              Every human society has some kind of religion in order to elevate 
              human beings from the animal status. Strictly speaking, this is 
              not the same thing as the 'true religion' as defined previously. 
              In order to clarify the difference between the meaning of <i>dharma 
              </i>as used in the terms <i>varnasrama-dharma </i>and <i>bhagavata-dharma, 
              </i> Prabhupada uses the word 'culture' as distinct from 'religion'. 
              Thus, Prabhupada says that Hinduism is a culture rather than a religious 
              denomination or 'faith' just as elsewhere he also approves the idea 
              that 'Hinduism is a way of life rather than a religion' (710622RC.MOS, 
              740217MW.BOM): 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>But the culture of the Indians is [based on the] Vedic 
                [scriptures] and begins with the four <i>varnas </i>and four <i>asramas. 
                </i>So these <i>varnas </i>and four <i>asramas</i> are meant for 
                a really civilised human race. The conclusion is that when a human 
                being is civilised in the true sense of the term, he follows the 
                system of <i>varna </i>and <i>asrama </i>and can be called a 'Hindu'. 
                Our Krsna Consciousness Movement is preaching these four <i>varnas 
                </i>and four <i>asramas, </i>so naturally it has got some relationship 
                with Hinduism. Hinduism should thus be understood from the cultural, 
                not the religious, point of view. Culture is never religion. Religion 
                is a faith whereas culture is education or advancement of knowledge 
                (70-07-09.JAN). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Even though there is a distinction to be made between 
              Hinduism as a cultural entity and the spiritual religion of <i>bhagavata-dharma, 
              </i>the former is not to be rejected out of hand. Indeed, Prabhupada 
              goes to much trouble to define and describe the <i>varnasrama-dharma 
              </i>in its genuine form and to disparage the form in which it currently 
              exists: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT> We don't find [the concept of] Hindu dharma in the 
                <i>Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>or any authorised Vedic 
                literature. Unfortunately, something hodgepodge known as Hindu 
                dharma has become very prominent in India. Our real Vedic dharma 
                is <i>varnasrama-dharma </i>(720907SB.NV). 
              <p align=LEFT>The institution of eight divisions is known as <i>varnasrama-dharma. 
                </i>Hindus are those who follow these eight divisions of human 
                society. That is called Hinduism. Now it has become a name only, 
                but actually this is Hindu religion. [What is going on in the 
                name of Hinduism] is not Hindu religion (680623SB.MON). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The two verses Prabhupada most often quotes when introducing 
              the <i>varnasrama <br>
              </i>concept are <i>Bhavagad-gita </i>4.13, in which Krsna states 
              that he created the society of four <i>varnas, </i>and <i>Visnu-purana 
              </i>3.8.9, which states that Lord Visnu is being worshipped by anyone 
              who acts according to the <i>varnasrama </i>system. Since it is 
              thus a method of purifying innate tendencies in human society, it 
              is also called <i>sanatana-dharma </i>and has no historical beginning 
              (SSR: 3). 
            <p align=LEFT>On more than one occasion, Prabhupada asked his disciples 
              to institute a reformed, Krsna-centred <i>varnasrama </i>system, 
              which he called the <i>daiva-varnasrama </i>(770122BG.BHU), and 
              specifically proposed the establishment of a <i>Varnasrama </i>College 
              where people would be trained in the prescribed duties of the different 
              <i>varnas.</i> <a href="jag3.html#e15">[15</a><a name="15"></a><a href="jag3.html#e15">]</a> 
              <i> </i>Though strictly speaking Vaisnavas are beyond the concerns 
              of society and so have nothing to do with this system, they should 
              try to institute it for the general benefit of mankind (750625SB.LA). 
            <p align=CENTER><b>VIII.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>It will not be possible to give a detailed analysis 
              of how Prabhupada envisioned a <i>varnasrama </i>society; this is 
              another project and must be conducted elsewhere, though it may be 
              said that he was thinking along Gandhian lines-a preindustrial, 
              agrarian society with a monarchical government system (730619SB.MAY).<a

 href="jag3.html#e16">[16]</a> <a name="16"></a> In essence, he conceived of a 
              society in which the edicts of the Hindu <i>dharma-sastra </i>would 
              be implemented. 
            <p align=LEFT>We have seen Prabhupada's definition of religion as 
              'the laws of God' which he takes from the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>(<i> 
              dharma.m saksat bhagavat-pranitam</i>). Subsequent to this declaration, 
              the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>(SB 6.3.20-21) states that there are 
              twelve <i>mahajanas, </i>or great authorities, who truly know <i>dharma. 
              </i>Of these twelve, Manu is one.<a href="jag3.html#e17">[17]</a> 
              <a name="17"></a> Even though this section is specifically concerned 
              with <i>bhagavata-dharma </i>and <i>bhakti-yoga </i>(Cf. 6.3.21-22), 
              Srila Prabhupada uses it to confirm the authority of the <i>Manu-samhita, 
              </i>'the lawbook for entire human society' (SB 2.1.36, 3.13.12, 
              8.1.16; CC 1.2.91-92, etc.) calling it 'revealed scripture' and 
              a 'standard book to be followed by human society' (BG 3.21P). It 
              is a law 'so perfect that it is applicable for all time' (710622RC.MOS) 
              and cannot be changed by any other process (SB 2.7.9P, 740218BG.BOM). 
              Manu's authority is further confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>4.2 
              and Prabhupada roughly equates Manu's laws with the <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>(SB 7.8.48). 
            <p align=LEFT>Manu is identified as the source of the 'directions 
              based on <i>varna </i>and <i>asrama </i>concerning how to live as 
              a human being' (SB 7.11.14P). Troubles in human society are traced 
              to the abandonment of 'the principles laid down by the <i>Manu-samhita 
              </i>and confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna' 
              (SB 7.8.48P). Prabhupada thus recommends that the leaders of human 
              society, out of a sense of responsibility to their dependants, should 
              be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes like 
              Manu (BG 3.21P). 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>If the king or dictator individually, or the members 
                of the government collectively, cannot maintain the state or kingdom 
                according to the rules of <i>Manu-samhita</i>, their government 
                will certainly not endure. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Space does not allow a detailed analysis of Prabhupada's 
              numerous references to Manu in this place, but it should be noted 
              that he principally stressed a conservative understanding of the 
              social and sexual morality found in these scriptures. Thus he accepted 
              manu's attitude to the status of women, divorce, widow remarriage, 
              dowry laws of inheritance and so on. This was the measuring stick 
              by which Prabhupada measured not only Hindu society, but all human 
              society in general. Nevertheless, he expected that since Manu was 
              known to Hindu society, Hindus in particular should take it all 
              seriously. He strongly denounced Nehru's revised 'Hindu code' for 
              allowing such things as divorce (SSR 6; 750514MW.PER). On one occasion, 
              for example, he indicated that lobbying to promote the <i>dharma-sastras 
              </i>was what the Vishwa Hindu Parishad should be doing rather than 
              political agitation: 'Hindu law means Manu-Samhita. So who is pressing 
              them that "We don't require any law except this?" And where is that 
              Hindu, strong Hindu? Hindu means Manu-Samhita' (760108MW.NEL). 
            <p align=LEFT>Despite this forceful promotion of Manu, however, Prabhupada 
              was consistent in believing that the object of Manu was to regulate 
              society in order to direct its members to the higher purpose of 
              renunciation and devotion: <i>pravrttir esa bhutanam nivrttis tu 
              mahaphala</i> (SB 6.4.9P). In support of this argument, he mentions 
              Manu's prescriptions for meat eating, which he understands as being 
              directives to gradually reduce that tendency until one can give 
              it up completely (760122MW.MAY). 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada speaks approvingly of Manu's vision of a 
              personally directed creation (CC Adi 6.15P) and thus concludes that 
              Manu 'directs all activities to the transcendental service of the 
              Lord'. His directives can, therefore, be superseded if a higher 
              principle is at stake. For instance, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu disapproved 
              of his <i>sannyasi </i>(renunciate) associate, Brahmananda Bharati, 
              wearing a deerskin (leather is not normally worn by Vaisnavas), 
              even though this was carried out according to Manu's injunction 
              (CC Madhya 10.54). Prabhupada also praised his spiritual master 
              for disregarding the Hindu restriction on overseas travel and placing 
              the preaching of <i>bhagavata-dharma </i>above it (<i>Phalguna-krsna-pancami</i>, 
              14). 
            <p align=LEFT> Furthermore, Prabhupada mentions that the atonements 
              (<i>prayascitta</i>) prescribed in the <i>dharma-sastras </i>like 
              <i>Manu-samhita </i>or <i>Parasara-samhita </i>may free one from 
              the immediate reactions of the most sinful activities, however, 
              they cannot go as far as promoting a sinful man to the stage of 
              loving service to the Lord. Whereas chanting the holy name of the 
              Lord even once, however, not only frees one immediately from the 
              reactions of the greatest sins, but also begins to raise that person 
              to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead (<i>Second Chance</i>: 16; lectures on SB 6.2.11-23). 
            <p align=LEFT>Most importantly, Prabhupada disagrees on the ascription 
              of caste by birth, which is certainly a feature of Manu's law. 'People 
              misunderstand Hindu culture, Vedic culture, that there are forced 
              caste system. No. It is <i>varnabhivyahjakam, </i>[caste is determined] 
              by the symptoms, qualities and qualifications, not by birth' (690525IN.NV). 
              By accepting regulative principles, even Westerners (that is, <i>mlecchas 
              </i>and <i>yavanas</i>) become <i>brahmanas </i>(SB 6.5.39P). Moreover, 
              Prabhupada held that 'One should accept those who thus become Vaisnavas 
              as being greater than <i>brahmanas, </i>Hindus or Indians' (CC Adi 
              7.23P).<a href="jag3.html#e18">[18</a><a name="18"></a><a

 href="jag3.html#e18">]</a> Thus, where Manu disapproves of Vedic instruction 
              for <i>sudras </i>or outcastes, Prabhupada says that this is not 
              applicable to those who convert to Vaisnavism, for they are no longer 
              on the level of a <i>sudra </i>or outcaste (740605R2.GEN).<a

 href="jag3.html#e19">[19]</a> <a name="19"></a> In Prabhupada's understanding, 
              however, the status of Vaisnava rests on the foundation of <i>de 
              facto</i> ritual purity achieved through rigorous moral and ethical 
              training. This can be achieved gradually through the <i>varnasrama 
              </i>system or directly by following the regulative principles and 
              practices of devotional service. Ritual purity on its own, however, 
              is not equivalent to Vaisnavism. 
            <p align=LEFT>Though Prabhupada frequently insisted on the establishment 
              of <i>varnasrama-dharma, </i>he occasionally hinted that there was 
              such a thing as an egalitarian Vaisnava society which transcended 
              it. 'So a systematic society means <i>varnasrama-dharma. </i>But 
              there is another way. That is called transcendental society or Vaisnava 
              society' (770122BG.BHU). 
            <p align=CENTER><b>IX.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>Whatever his reservations about the current state of 
              Hinduism, Prabhupada held that Indian people were both privileged 
              and entrusted with a great responsibility: 'Krsna is not meant for 
              the Hindus [alone], but Krsna appeared in Hindustan. Therefore it 
              is the duty of all Hindus to know Krsna first. And they [are indeed 
              Krsna-] conscious. Every Hindu knows Krsna. Every Hindu observes 
              the <i>Janmastami, </i>Krsna's birthday' (750309RC.LON). 
            <p

 align=LEFT>The <i>Caitanya-caritamrta </i>verse, 'One who has taken his birth 
              as a human being in India should make his life successful and work 
              for the benefit of all other people' (Adi 9.41), is quoted many 
              times (over 200 times in the Folio) by Prabhupada. He thus considered 
              it a special duty of the Indian people to spread Krsna consciousness 
              all over the world in fulfilment of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's prediction. 
              As a result, he admits again that a direct relationship exists between 
              Hinduism and Krsna consciousness: 'Since it is mostly Hindus who 
              are accepting this Krsna consciousness, you can call it like Hinduism. 
              But it is not Hinduism' (711110IV.DEL). 
            <p>Despite his oft-repeated feeling that everyone in India is 'naturally 
              Krsna conscious' and though he felt that the common people of India 
              were 'still alright' (770112R2.BHU) and strictly followed the rules 
              and regulations (680504SB.BOS), by which he generally meant the 
              four regulative principles of abstinence from meateating, illicit 
              sex, intoxication and gambling, he was worried about the generally 
              negative influence of western culture on India and the Hindu diaspora 
              (75-08-31.SRI). 
            <p>Of the vestiges of Vedic culture, Prabhupada mentions vegetarianism: 
              'No Hindu family will allow meat-eating' (740107SB.LA). He approved 
              of Gandhi's move to introduce prohibition (740107SB.LA). He spoke 
              highly of the Indian marital tradition of lifelong fidelity (681225WE.LA), 
              the giving of Lord Narayana's (a form of Lord Vishnu) names to Hindu 
              children, despite atheistic propaganda (750917SB.VRN) and the continuing 
              worship of Laksmi-Narayana (Lord Visnu and his consort) by householders 
              gave Prabhupada the feeling that 'there is some glimpse of human 
              civilization in India', giving hope that it could be revived in 
              modern times (750925MW.AHM). 
            <p align=LEFT>We have already seen that Prabhupada considered all 
              'faiths' to be <i>prakrta </i>or mundane, and that even the <i>varnasrama 
              </i>system based on the laws of God ultimately had to be transcended 
              in order to achieve the true purpose of religion, namely love of 
              God. Inasmuch as others did not see this as the purpose of the Vedic 
              religious system, he criticised them in various ways, both in general 
              and in particular. 
            <p align=LEFT>There were two aspects to this criticism, one related 
              to behaviour (<i>sad-acara</i>), the other to ideas. He compared 
              Hindus to Christians 'who admit they are Christian but don't follow 
              the Christian principles.They accept Krsna but don't follow his 
              instruction. They have lost their own culture and they want to imitate 
              Western culture' (750309RC.LON). But worse, despite this departure 
              from their own traditions, 'they are under the impression that they 
              know everything and have nothing to learn from [the Krsna consciousness 
              movement]' (70-05-27.TAM). Prabhupada's early experiences with Indian 
              expatriates in America and England left him unenthusiastic about 
              spreading Krsna consciousness amongst them. Instead, he told his 
              disciples to concentrate their efforts on preaching to Europeans 
              and Americans (68-09-29.GUR). 
            <p align=LEFT>He says on one occasion that the Hindu religion is dead 
              because it lacks philosophy and by sentiment alone was unable to 
              attract those who had been hardened by material sense gratification.<a href="jag3.html#e20">[20]</a><a name="20"></a> 
              Prabhupada would not allow Hindus to come and speak at ISKCON temples. 
              There was a question of doctrinal purity. In India Prabhupada himself 
              walked out of a <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>conference in Indore in 1970 
              when he heard Mayavadi<a href="jag3.html#e21">[</a><a name="21"></a><a

 href="jag3.html#e21">21]</a> interpretations of <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>(<i>Lilamrta</i>, 
              Vol. 4, 147-150). Mayavadis are offenders to Krsna (CC Madhya 17.129) 
              and hearing from them causes 'everything to become spoiled' (CC 
              Madhya 6.169). 
            <p align=LEFT>The cause of the deterioration of Hindu culture, according 
              to Prabhupada, is loss of belief in the Vedic literatures presented 
              by Vyasadeva (69-07-08.MRK). Prabhupada thus rejected the concept 
              behind organisations such as the Arya Samaj because they accept 
              only the original Veda and reject the other supplementary literatures 
              to the original Veda as a pretext for pushing their own agendas 
              which have little to do with the purpose of such important scriptures 
              (TLC 24, 661216BG.NY) and because they deny deity worship (751007MW.DUR). 
              He goes so far as to call them atheistic inasmuch as they accept 
              Krsna as merely a great personality, but not God (740704BG.HON)<a name="22"></a><a href="jag3.html#e22">[22]</a> 
              . He criticised the Ramakrsna Mission for posturing and suggested 
              that their failure to attract westerners to seriously taking up 
              'Hindu' spiritual practices was because they were preaching Hinduism, 
              rather than 'real spiritual culture'. However, most of all, he reproached 
              Vivekananda for allowing <i>sannyasis </i>to eat meat, which goes 
              against Hindu custom (7404214MW.HYD, 760108MW.NEL). 
            <p>Prabhupada vehemently protested the polytheism of Hinduism by which 
              other gods are put on an equal level with Krsna. Even worse were 
              the pantheistic ideas by which one can 'make one's own God'. He 
              particularly held up to ridicule one follower of the Ramakrsna Mission 
              who took this to the extreme of saying that 'even stool is God' 
              (730711R2.LON, 770127R2.PUR). 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada blamed the Mayavadis and the politicians 
              for killing the spirit of India. His view was that Mayavada preaching 
              of pantheism and polytheism led people to diminish the importance 
              of religion. Vivekananda was singled out as the beginning of Hindu 
              downfall for his philanthropic idea of <i>daridra-narayana. </i>Prabhupada 
              paraphrased him, saying, 'Where you are searching for God? Don't 
              you see so many gods are loitering in the street, the poor? Better 
              you serve them. Why do you go to the temple?' For him this revealed 
              a complete misunderstanding of what God is. 'The whole world, they 
              are trying to banish God, the Kamsa's policy, &quot;Kill God,&quot; 
              whole world, the Communists, total. This is our position' (751007MW.DUR). 
              The politicians then used ideas such as <i>daridra-narayana-seva 
              </i>to draw people from religious to humanitarian and political 
              activity. 'The Mayavadis create the field of atheism and later on, 
              the politicians make them perfect atheists' (750909MW.VRN). 
            <p align=LEFT>In private conversations, Prabhupada did not spare many 
              of the great modern saints of Hinduism. They were mostly criticised 
              for preaching the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>while neglecting devotion 
              to Krsna. He expressed dismay that 'Gandhi, Radhakrsna and other 
              big <i>acaryas </i>of India do not believe in Krsna' (750305RC.NY). 
              Indeed, nothing raised Prabhupada's ire more than the misuse of 
              the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>as a tool for preaching other doctrines. 
              He rejected Gandhi for his allegorical interpretation and would 
              say that Gandhi's doctrine of non-violence did not work because 
              it was not a system authorised by scripture (660530BG.NY). Prabhupada 
              often emphasised that Krsna was a real person and the stories of 
              His pastimes were not allegorical, but actually took place on earth. 
              Upon visiting Kuruksetra in 1970, for example, Prabhupada triumph-antly 
              proclaimed that it was a real place and not an allegory (<i>Lilamrta</i>, 
              Vol. 4, 134, 770413RC.BOM). 
            <p align=LEFT>Last but not least, Prabhupada was angered by conservative 
              upper-caste Hindu opinion which would not accept his disciples as 
              genuine Vaisnavas and <i>brahmanas. </i>He considered those that 
              barred them from entering Hindu temples to be malicious. This was 
              consistent with his rejection of the narrow, ethnic understanding 
              of Hinduism. 
            <p align=CENTER><b>X.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>We have seen that Prabhupada held that Hindu religion, 
              both in the sense of a social system based on <i>Manu-samhita, </i>and 
              a God-centred religious system based on the <i>Gita </i>and <i>Bhagavata, 
              </i>had deteriorated in recent times. We may ask the question, to 
              what extent does Prabhupada subscribe to the Hindu nationalist world 
              view which sees Hinduism as being fallen from a golden epoch in 
              the distant past and under siege in the present? 
            <p align=LEFT>At a meeting in 1973, he told Arnold Toynbee that the 
              Greeks came from India. 'Vedic culture was once all over the world. 
              Gradually a new type of culture-just like this recent partition 
              of India and Pakistan-took place' (730722RC.LON). Many times he 
              said that five thousand years ago, the entire planet was known as 
              Bharatavarsa and was 'under Vedic culture.' <i>Mahabharata </i>is 
              thus the history of 'greater Bharatavarsa.' The culture was gradually 
              lost, the social disruption beginning from the degeneration of the 
              <i>brahmanas </i>and then the <i>ksatriyas. </i>Bharatavarsa became 
              smaller and smaller until the most recent partition in 1947. This 
              is considered just another chapter in a long loss of glory. Just 
              as the people of Pakistan are all originally Hindus, so too the 
              rest of the world was once Hindu (740501MW.BOM). Prabhupada also 
              predicted that this would continue; with the future deterioration 
              of Vedic culture, the creation of Sikhistan and then other '-stans' 
              was inevitable (JSD 6.1). 
            <p align=LEFT>Unlike many Hindu nationalists, however, Prabhupada 
              did not claim an original homeland for the Aryans (whom he calls 
              Indo-Aryans or Indo-Europeans) in India, but says that they divided 
              in the Caucasus to go either to India or to Europe. This supposedly 
              happened when Parasurama threatened to kill the <i>ksatriyas. </i>These 
              <i>ksatriyas </i>fled to Europe while others settled in the Middle 
              East (760421RC.MEL). Identifying the Caspian Sea as the place of 
              Kasyapa Muni, he expressed the belief that it will be possible to 
              ascertain by historical references that the whole planet was once 
              known as Bharatavarsa (730507SB.LA). 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada held that the <i>varnasrama </i>cultural 
              system was operational through to the period of Candragupta Maurya, 
              roughly contemporaneous to Alexander the Great. Prabhupada held 
              Candragupta's prime minister Canakya up as an example of a disinterested 
              brahmana advising a pious monarch in the ideal situation (SB 2.7.9P). 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada sees the deterioration of Vedic culture in 
              India as being at least in part the result of foreign conquests, 
              of which there were many even prior to Muslims. He blames the conversion 
              of so many Hindus to Islam on a combination of factors. First of 
              all, upper caste Hindus did not treat them very well. 'There was 
              a custom, a very bad custom, in South India, that if a <i>sudra 
              </i>passed on the street he had to shout, &quot;I am a <i>sudra 
              </i>passing on the street. Please close your door.&quot; The <i>brahmanas 
              </i>would then close their doors so that they would not see him, 
              for if they did, [they believed that] everything would be spoiled-their 
              food grains and everything' (740526SB.ROM). 
            <p align=LEFT>Another important factor was that the lower-caste Hindus 
              were not given any facility for spiritual culture. The <i>brahmanas 
              </i> monopolised spiritual culture and mistreated the <i>sudras 
              </i>and the <i>candalas </i>and kept them downtrodden. When Aurangzeb 
              imposed the <i>jizya </i>tax for all non-Muslims, these downtrodden 
              lower classes naturally thought what is the use of remaining Hindu? 
              As a result they converted wholesale to Islam (740526SB.ROM). He 
              sees this not only as one of the main causes for Hindus converting 
              to Islam, but also for the rise of Communism (which he also strongly 
              opposed for its godlessness) in modern India. It was also acknowledged 
              that there were other elements which contributed to the conversion 
              to Islam. 
            <p align=LEFT>But if <i>brahmanical </i>intolerance and Muslim policy 
              had a deleterious effect on Hindu culture, the British were worse. 
              'Lord Macauley's private report was that &quot;If you allow the 
              Indians to remain Hindu, you will never be able to rule over them.&quot; 
              So it was the British government's policy to condemn everything 
              Indian. They did not put their hands on their culture directly, 
              but did so surreptitiously' (750521RC.MEL). 'The Britishers peacefully 
              killed the Hindu culture, Vedic culture' (750313RC.TEH).<a href="jag3.html#e23">[23]</a> 
              <a name="23"></a> Prabhupada blamed the British for formenting violence 
              between the Hindus and Muslims who had been generally friendly to 
              one another (681129BG.LA). 
            <p align=CENTER><b>XI.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>In view of Prabhupada's historical understanding, framed 
              around the incipient deterioration of Vedic culture, as well as 
              his conception of the <i>varnasrama </i>system based on Manu, we 
              might well have expected him to have expressed some political opinions, 
              but in fact he was not enthusiastic about government systems that 
              he encountered nor did he support any political reform movements 
              as a leader of an international Society. 
            <p align=LEFT>However, on the whole, Prabhupada kept himself allof 
              from political activity of any kind. He showed no enthusiasm for 
              any government systems that he encountered and gave no official 
              support to any political reform group, including those that affiliated 
              themselves with Hindu goals. The word <i>Rama-rajya, </i>when used 
              as a Hindu nationalist buzz-word, elicited Prabhupada's disdain 
              rather than support: he suggested that such people wanted the kingdom 
              of God without God (SB 9.10.50). The Hindu political movement did 
              not interest him. Even in <i>Back to Godhead</i> in September 1944 
              (1.1) before taking the renounced order of life, he refered to 'imaginary 
              ideas of Hinduraj or Muslimraj' being doomed to failure. 
            <p>Prabhupada told his disciples not to get involved with modern political 
              movements as there would be a conflict of values; devotees and politicians 
              would never be able to agree on common aims. He himself had given 
              up political activism in Gandhi's home-rule movement in order to 
              join his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati (681230IV.LA). 
              He liked to tell how his Guru answered the criticism of political 
              activists who accused him of depriving the Indian nationalist movement 
              of youthful energy by diverting so many young men to the devotional 
              life. Bhaktisiddhanta responded tongue-in-cheek that his followers 
              were too weak and only good for chanting Hare Krsna (741021SB.MAY). 
            <p>Prabhupada stated clearly that he favoured education to political 
              processes because people had to be changed not by fiat (decree) 
              but by conviction 740112MW.LA). Thus, in 1972 when his disciple 
              Balavanta dasa ran for mayor of Atlanta, he did not advise him to 
              create any complex political programme, but to use the occasion 
              to preach the concepts behind Krsna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada did, however, occasionally recommend government 
              intervention in religious matters, calling his proposal a 'Vedic 
              idea of the secular state'. According to this idea, the government 
              should take responsibility for all religious systems in the country 
              whether Hindu, Christian, Muslim or Buddhist, seeing to it, for 
              example, that a professing Hindu is executing the Hindu principles 
              of religion properly. He advises licensing religions (730226RC.JKT). 
              His worry was, 'If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, 
              then they are simply animals. So it is the government's duty to 
              see that the citizens are not becoming animals' (730905RC.STO).<a

 href="jag3.html#e24">[24]</a> <a name="24"></a> 
            <p align=CENTER><b>XII.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>One last element in this examination of Prabhupada's 
              use of the word 'Hindu' relates to his pragmatism about how to present 
              himself and his movement while preaching the <i>bhagavata-dharma. 
              </i>Though uncompromising, Prabhupada was practical and sought the 
              most effective way to present Krsna consciousness, either dissimulating 
              or vaunting its connection with Hinduism according to circumstances. 
              As we have seen, Prabhupada was fighting against preconceived western 
              notions of Hinduism. Even prior to his coming to New York in 1965, 
              he was constantly in contact with what he saw as secular misconceptions 
              and prejudices with regard to Hinduism and Krsna consciousness in 
              Indian educated society. As a result, he constantly emphasised the 
              universal aspect of his religion. Thus when greeted by many upon 
              his return to India as a conquering hero who had converted westerners 
              to Hinduism, Prabhupada denied that this had ever been his purpose. 
              On one morning walk he said, 'Foreign devotees are not joining this 
              movement because it is a Hindu culture. They take it as a real spiritual 
              culture' (760108MW.NEL). 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>'Our point is not to convert them to Hinduism. Take 
                <i>prasadam</i>, take dress, chant Hare Krsna, dance. That's all. 
                I never said to all these European and American disciples that 
                "You become a Hindu"... I asked them, &quot;Just become lover 
                of God. That's all. If you can love God through your religion, 
                that's all right. You do that.&quot; I never said, &quot;You become 
                Hindu.&quot; Then I would not have been able to [convince them]' 
                (740217MW.BOM). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>With these last words, it is apparent that Prabhupada 
              was aware, that to present himself as a Hindu not only would have 
              gone against his deeply held beliefs, but that in the context of 
              Western society, it would have been counter-productive. For these 
              reasons he therefore strategically presented Krsna consciousness 
              as 'the science of God': 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>They would have said, 'We have got Christianity. Why 
                should I accept your Hinduism?' Now, if you go anywhere, if you 
                want to preach Hinduism, why they should be interested in Hinduism? 
                They can hear some words. But we are not talking of Hinduism and 
                Muhammadanism; we are talking on the science of God (701107RC.BOM). 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>On the other hand, Prabhupada was trying to establish 
              a spiritual movement that grew up from within a Hindu culture. In 
              this he had natural allies amongst those who shared with him many 
              of the common ideals of his culture. In his determination to achieve 
              this purpose of bringing what he believed was a true spiritual message 
              untainted by materialistic purposes, he could and did try to find 
              such allies by appealing to such common interests. A good example 
              of this is the appeal he made to the Gandhi Memorial Fund in which 
              he outlined how he intended to achieve Gandhian ideals such as the 
              uplift of the Harijans, dissemination of the <i>Bhagavad-gita's 
              </i>message 'on an authentic basis' (49-02-28. SAR). Of course the 
              authentic basis was <i>bhagavata-dharma. </i>Similarly, at one point 
              he hoped to get grants in the context of Indian government cultural 
              diplomacy by presenting his preaching efforts under the non-sectarian 
              designation of a 'cultural movement'. This was stated in similar 
              terms to Nirmal Babu in 1970: 'So this Krsna Consciousness cultural 
              movement is not actually Hindu movement, but originally it is India 
              cultural movement' (70-06-24.NIR). 
            <p align=LEFT>As the movement grew in India, Prabhupada was made aware 
              of other dangers which could grow out of an identification with 
              Hinduism, specifically government interference in temple management 
              such as was going on in Tirupati in south India. For this and other 
              reasons, he recommended his disciples to openly deny any connection 
              with Hinduism (760108MW.NEL). 
            <p>On other occasions, he overtly played to Hindu sensibilities. In 
              his early days in New York, he solicited help from his benefactor 
              Sumati Morarji for the construction of 'the first Hindu temple [in 
              New York]': 'It will be recorded in the history of the world that 
              the first Hindu temple is started by a pious Hindu lady Srimati 
              Sumati Morarji who is not only a big business magnate in India but 
              a pious Hindu Lady, a great devotee of Lord Krsna.' The object was 
              'to impress the people what actually the Hindu culture is' (65-11-10. 
              SUM). 
            <p align=LEFT>Help from other Hindu organisations was solicited when 
              in 1973 the temple at Juhu, Mumbai, India was demolished in the 
              midst of difficulties. The pro-Hindu Jan Sangh party headed up a 
              'Save the Temple' committee. Mr Gupta, a member of that party, published 
              his own leaflet declaring ISKCON to be a bona-fide Hindu organisation 
              (<i>Lilamrta</i> 5, 136-137).<a href="jag3.html#e25">[25</a><a name="25"></a><a href="jag3.html#e25">]</a> 
              Also in 1974, in the hope that ISKCON devotees could be admitted 
              into temples such as the one in Jagannatha Puri, Prabhupada also 
              sought certification that they were 'bona-fide Hindus' from Swami 
              Cinmayananda of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (74-05-31. ACY). 
            <p>In America, Prabhupada had to respond to the need to preserve his 
              work by threats from different areas. As we have seen earlier, he 
              saw the message that he was preaching to be beyond classification 
              of 'Hindu', though this would not necessarily be recognised by governments 
              around the world. When difficult legal situations arose in America 
              he thought it better to claim to be Hindu: 'America has got freedom 
              of religion, so if they accept my movement as Hindu religion, they 
              cannot do anything' (761229RC.BOM). 
            <p>In this way Prabhupada made use of cultural ties with 'Hindu' organisations 
              for the purpose of preaching the message of the Vedas, even though 
              he did not consider the message of the Veda to be 'Hindu' as such.
