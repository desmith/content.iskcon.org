            <p align=LEFT><i>In this presentation, Hari-dhama dasa discusses an 
              important social issue for the Society: that of providing care for 
              the terminally ill in the movement. Since Vaisnava hold very dear 
              the hope of dying in the association of devotees and at a place 
              of pilgrimage, ISKCON faces a challenging task in providing this 
              facility and care for its members. The author argues that both spiritual 
              care and medical care should be available to patients, be they in 
              a secular hospice or in a religious institution. He goes on to present 
              some possible methods of approach to both carers in ISKCON and the 
              caring profession in general. The author is currently in the process 
              of conducting further research into the needs for spiritual care 
              specifically within the Vaisnava context.</i> 
            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>As ISKCON looks toward the twenty-first century it will face 
              increased demands both from its members and from those outside the 
              movement to address its social, political and economic fabric, it 
              will have to recognise and provide more for the spiritual needs 
              of its members, and this will also have to include preparation and 
              support for those facing old age and death. For a devotee to leave 
              his or her body in the company of other Vaishnava devotees is considered 
              the mercy of the Lord, and to depart from the body at a place of 
              pilgrimage is the fulfilment of life on earth. As yet, death, dying 
              and bereavement amongst devotees around the world have not reached 
              proportions where ISKCON has had to provide facilities common to 
              the Society at large. Providing for the devotee with a terminal 
              illness, taking care of the elderly and dying within ISKCON, and 
              providing professional facilities for those in need of spiritual 
              care will need to be an important component of social development 
              structure. 
            <p>This paper is also addressed to lay and professional carers, advocating 
              the need to include and develop spiritual care in their work if 
              they are to provide holistic care to patients. Holistic care of 
              the body, mind and spirit involves an appreciation of the term 'spirituality' 
              and the knowledge of how to respond effectively to the spiritual 
              needs of the individual. Vaishnavas will refer to the term ' spiritual' 
              in a very specific sense; for them this refers to the eternal relationship 
              between the individual and God, but for the purposes of this article 
              the word will be used as understood in the western generic sense 
              of the term. 
            <p>As sentient beings, spirituality is a constitutional part of human 
              life and for this reason, carers can not ignore the spiritual needs 
              of patients in their care. Dying is more than a biological occurrence: 
              it is a physical, social and spiritual event. The real challenge 
              to the caring profession is the cultivation and expression of an 
              increased quality of spirituality and spiritual care. Nurses, doctors 
              and carers, due to their constant contact with the patient have 
              a unique role when spiritual care presents itself at its most profound: 
              when a person is preparing to face death. In those areas of the 
              world where medical care has been shaped by sophisticated technologies 
              and complicated health care delivery systems, efforts to humanise 
              patient care are essential if the integrity of the human being is 
              not to be obscured by the system. This is needed especially for 
              individuals with chronic maladies, or those who are in the process 
              of dying. 
            <p>This paper will examine the need for ISKCON to provide professional 
              care to the terminally ill who come to their centres for the sole 
              purpose of passing their last days in the company of devotees. The 
              following discussion of the responsibilities and training that professional 
              carers should have are also applicable to those devotees that would 
              like to enter, or are at present in the caring field. Issues raised 
              in this article are intended to help in the formulation of a practical 
              policy for taking care of the sick and dying in ISKCON's care. 
            <p><b>Spirituality: what does it mean? <br>
              </b>Spiritual care aims at bringing harmony and balance back into 
              the life of a patient. Thus for a person to function as an integrated 
              whole, the individual must experience harmony amongst mind, spirit 
              and body. Spiritual care is therefore not restricted to patients 
              with a terminal illness, but to all those who find themselves neglected 
              in one or more aspect of their wholeness. This paper, however, will 
              deal mainly with diagnosing and responding to the spiritual pain 
              in patients. 
            <p>The awareness and appreciation of a patient's individual spiritual 
              orientation is essential to holistic care. Transcendence, or the 
              striving for an existence apart from this world, is probably the 
              most powerful way that one is restored to wholeness after an injury 
              to their person, be it physical, emotional or spiritual. The sufferer 
              is not isolated by pain, but is brought closer to a transcendental 
              source of that meaning, and to the human community that shares these 
              values. This paper will also address the diagnosing and response 
              to spiritual pain as experienced by dying patients. 
            <p><b>Spirituality and the carer <br>
              </b>Spirituality is concerned with the transcendental, inspirational 
              and existential way to live one's life, and this could also include, 
              in a fundamental and profound sense, the individual in relation 
              to God. An individual's perception of spirituality and their spiritual 
              need are normally heightened as the individual confronts spiritual 
              pain and ultimately faces death. A holistic approach to patient 
              and individual care implies care for the body, mind and spirit. 
              Spirituality is often mistakenly equated to, or used synonymously 
              with, institutionalised religion, therefore for the purpose of this 
              article M. E. O'Brien's definition will be used: he has defined 
              spirituality very broadly as 'that which inspires in one the desire 
              to transcend the realm of the material.'<a href="#01">[1]</a><a name="_ednref1"></a> 
              This definition is helpful as it is broad enough to include a religious 
              understanding of the term, but yet is not specific to any one religion 
              and allows for the inclusion of those that have a personal philosophy 
              to the meaning of life. 
            <p>The basis for determining the level of an individual's spiritual 
              health or integrity can be ascertained in the following ways: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Stallwood<a href="#02">[2]</a><a name="_ednref2"></a> and Kreidler<a href="#03">[3]</a><a name="_ednref3"></a> 
                recognise relational aspects within the concept of spirituality. 
                The qualities of forgiveness, love, hope and trust can be experienced 
                in relationship between two people as well as God. Relationships 
                such as these bring meaning and fulfilment to life itself, providing 
                a purpose for living. </li>
              <li>Spirituality is an aspect of the total person that is related 
                to and integrated with the functioning and expression of all other 
                aspects of the person. </li>
              <li>Spirituality can also be expressed through the relationships 
                between the individual and others, and through a transcendental 
                relationship with God or another realm where spirituality involves 
                and produces behaviours and feelings which demonstrate the existence 
                of love, faith, hope and trust, therein providing meaning to life 
                and a reason for being. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Spiritual integrity is present when the person experiences wholeness 
              within the self, with other human beings and living entities, and 
              in transcendence with God. Spiritual integrity is furthermore demonstrated 
              through such acts that show love, hope, humility, trust and forgiveness 
              towards others. 
            <p>Spirituality is a quality that goes beyond religious affiliation. 
              Spirituality inspires one to strive for inspirations, reverence, 
              awe, meaning and purpose even in those who do not believe in a God-applying 
              equally to the needs of believers and non-believers. Spiritual beliefs 
              and practices permeate the life of a person, whether in health or 
              illness. The influence of spirituality is manifested in our relationship 
              with others, life styles and habits, required and prohibited behaviours, 
              and the general frame during our spiritual development and growth. 
              Religious affiliation may foster attention on, or hinder spiritual 
              issues. We should understand that patients and family are in a vulnerable 
              state when dealing with terminal illness, and it should be the needs 
              of the patient that dictate the role of religious representatives 
              and not vice versa. 
            <p><b>How is spirituality expressed? <br>
              </b>The expression of spirituality is shaped by the accepted practices 
              and beliefs of a particular culture and this may be expressed in 
              some cases by the practices and beliefs of an institutionalised 
              religion. Spiritual needs are fulfilled through such avenues as 
              prayers, rituals, religious communities and worship. The institution 
              codifies and provides pathways for the expression of beliefs and 
              values held by the person. It provides meaning to life, and sustains 
              the person through personal hardships such as illness, pain and 
              personal difficulties. It also provides an avenue for celebration 
              when hardships are overcome. 
            <p>Mystical experiences can also bring about a sense of peaceful calm 
              and stability in the turmoil of those experiencing personal calamities. 
              These experiences are often described as another reality and provide 
              hope, faith in a future, and a sense of love and meaning to life. 
              Here the physical and the emotional interact with the spiritual 
              to change the focus in the person's life. Meaningful and purposeful 
              work, or creative expression, is often an expression of spirituality. 
              The person may feel a need to communicate experiences of feelings 
              which relate to the ' other worldly' aspects of life. 
            <p align=LEFT>Another manner in which the spirituality of the person 
              may be recognised is through behaviour or feelings that convey an 
              altered spiritual integrity. O'Brien has listed seven common human 
              experiences under the general category of altered spiritual integrity.<a href="#04">[4]</a><a name="_ednref4"></a> 
              These experiences include spiritual pain, alienation, anxiety, guilt, 
              anger, loss and despair. Let us examine spiritual pain, as this 
              is an area of care in which both carer and sufferer find the greatest 
              difficulty. 
            <p><b>How can spiritual pain be recognised? <br>
              </b>Spiritual pain can be defined as an individual's perception 
              of hurt or suffering associated with that part of his or her person 
              that seeks to transcend the realm of the material; it is manifested 
              by a deep sense of hurt stemming from feelings of loss or separation 
              from one's God or deity, a sense of personal inadequacy before God 
              and humanity, or a lasting condition of loneliness of spirit. Kim 
              et al defines spiritual pain as ' a disruption in the life principle 
              that pervades a person's entire being and that integrates and transcends 
              one's biological and psycho-social nature.' <a href="#05">[5]</a><a name="_ednref5"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Although spiritual pain has achieved comparable recognition 
              to physical and emotional pain in the care of patients with terminal 
              disease, it is less well recognised in those who are not terminally 
              ill. When comparing the assessment of spiritual pain to physical 
              pain, there are few guidelines that can be utilised. It is mainly 
              the lack of objective symptoms of spiritual pain that hinder the 
              diagnostic process. On the other hand, friends and family may be 
              a resource for eliciting suffering from a patient. As with physical 
              pain, there are some patients who feel the need to suffer from spiritual 
              pain for specific reasons. We must appreciate that for them pain 
              is not a ' problem' in our sense of the word. Spiritual pain represents 
              the agony of an unmet need, whether it is psychological, emotional, 
              mental or physical. Dame Cecily Saunders, founder of the modern 
              day hospice movement, writes: 'The realisation that life is likely 
              to end soon may well give rise to feelings of the unfairness of 
              what is happening, and at much of what as gone before, and above 
              all a desolate feeling of meaninglessness. Here lies, I believe 
              the essence of spiritual pain.' <a href="#06">[6]</a><a

 name="_ednref6"></a> This is echoed by the Austrian psychologist V. Frankl, that 
              'Man is not destroyed by suffering, he is destroyed by suffering 
              without meaning.' <a href="#07">[7]</a><a name="_ednref7"></a> 
            <p>Spiritual pain can be the result of an experience which completely 
              shattered a previously held view of life for an individual, taking 
              the meaning and focus out of their existence, leaving them desolate 
              and helpless. This experience may be an illness, or an accident, 
              or some catastrophic event in their life. During these traumatic 
              events the individual's assumptions about life, trust and love, 
              may be found to be misplaced, leaving them with nothing to hold 
              onto for hope and security in the present and the foreseeable future. 
              In these situations suicide often seems the only way out 'I feel 
              empty and shattered' or 'There is nothing left for me' . 
            <p>It is important to recognise that there is often a level of pain 
              far deeper than the pain of a particular loss. That deeper pain 
              is often associated with something totally destroyed at the centre 
              of the individual's being. This 'something' can be described as 
              the person's view of life, their relationship with God, a map or 
              picture of what life is about for them, or the values and principles 
              they hold dear in their lives. An individual's response to any event 
              in life partly arises from the view of life that lies at his or 
              her centre. It is because this shattering of a person's view of 
              life leads to a loss of a sense of meaning to existence, that meaninglessness 
              is often seen as the centre of spiritual pain. It is often expressed 
              as 'Why?' or 'Why me?' Spiritual pain can also be recognised in 
              the individual's perception of life. When this fundamental perception 
              has been radically changed, impaired or broken by some event, spiritual 
              pain is at its most profound; this is often expressed as, ' I can't 
              see any meaning in anything' , 'Nothing adds up any more', or 'My 
              world is in pieces and I am lost and lonely.'

              </b>Spiritual pain is managed not only by professionals, but more 
              often through relationships amongst the individual and their friends 
              and family. It is a normal human activity which takes place on various 
              levels: anything from a hug, holding a hand, empathic listening, 
              a prayer, a gift or even a massage, may be a valuable part of spiritual 
              pain management. 
            <p>Professionally, spiritual care could include therapy, counselling 
              and medication. Whilst we care for the body and mind by means of 
              medication we can treat the spirit by means of non-medication based 
              therapy; this would include alternative and complementary therapies 
              such as art therapy, acupuncture, homeopathy, reflexology, music 
              therapy and so on, these should be combined with excellent inter-personal 
              communication and counselling skills. Both the medication and non-medication 
              approach work hand-in-hand towards the ultimate goal of spiritual 
              care: providing quality of life when facing death. They are both 
              parallel and complementary if need be. Carers should acknowledge 
              that that they have a responsibility for the spiritual well-being 
              of the patient, and should not avoid providing this level of care. 
            <p>As we assess physical pain on a continuous basis, spiritual pain 
              requires the same frequency of assessment; it is not just a matter 
              of ticking a box on the patient's admission form that asks about 
              their religious affiliation. As a lack of homeostasis may manifest 
              itself as physical pain, spiritual pain also represents a lack of 
              balance or adjustment to one's immediate self; (this would be the 
              result of something that had happened very recently rather than 
              from something in the patient's long-term personal history). Consequently, 
              an evaluation of a patient's spiritual orientation seems appropriate 
              in order to diagnose spiritual pain. 
            <p align=LEFT>With spiritual pain one cannot simply point a finger 
              to exactly where it hurts. Feifel stresses that it is not necessary 
              to understand fully a patient's spiritual orientation when creating 
              an environment to offer nurturing. However, studies have shown that 
              carers are less than willing to provide such care. Those caring 
              for the terminally ill complained that too much was being asked 
              of their own spiritual orientation, with them being unwilling to 
              provide this care as one of their functions. <a href="#08"> [8]</a><a name="_ednref8"></a> 
              It seems reasonable to conclude that some health professionals may 
              be holding back this nurturing ability in order to be perceived 
              as credible health care practitioners¾offering 'spiritual care' 
              may not be seen as part of their role. Yet, spiritual care need 
              not trigger inferences of faith healing or hocus-pocus. The essence 
              of spiritual care-giving is not administering religious doctrine 
              or dogma, but the capacity to enter into the world of others and 
              to respond with feeling. 
            <p align=LEFT>This fundamental capacity involves touching another 
              at a level that is deeper than ideological or doctrinal differences. 
              In this capacity it is essential that carers are willing to address 
              their own spiritual orientation in relation to the needs of their 
              patients without influencing the patient's right to receive the 
              type of spiritual support that they desire. Carers must examine 
              their own personal belief system. Self examination will enable them 
              to understand and empathise with the need of the patient on a spiritual 
              level, Burnard supports this when he asks, ' If we do not clarify 
              our own spiritual beliefs or lack of them, how can we help those 
              in our care to clarify theirs?' <a href="#09">[9]</a><a name="_ednref9"></a> 
              If carers fail to address their own spirituality and the meaning 
              behind it, they will fail those who depend on us for making their 
              passage through death less painful. It is the responsibility of 
              those caring for the spiritually needy to add the spiritual dimension 
              to their care, irrespective of being theistically, atheistically 
              or agnostically inclined. 
            <p>Carers can help by being with the person suffering spiritual pain 
              and offering their support according to their capabilities. In this 
              capacity it is important to avoid easy optimism: 'You'll be all 
              right', hasty analysis of the situation (there may be deeper levels 
              of pain than the obvious) or, too early affirmation or comfort (stopping 
              the sufferer going deeper into the pain). 
            <p align=LEFT>Another common mistake that carers make when dealing 
              with patients is allowing their own anxieties to dictate their course 
              of action. This is commonly manifested by talking unnecessarily 
              (the best form of communication in some situations may be silence), 
              or providing uninvited sharing of the carer's own experience (one 
              should avoid saying, 'I understand', as this factually may not be 
              the case). It is more important to be a good listener than someone 
              who has all the answers for solving a patient's pain. Each person 
              has to bear his or her own pain and find their own way through it; 
              the carer can only be a support in this process, as Ainsworth-Smith 
              and Speck write: 'we must all grieve our own grief so we must do 
              our own dying, and face the possibility and reality of our own mortality, 
              and others should enable us to do this in our own way.' <a href="#10">[10]</a><a name="_ednref10"></a> 
            <p>During times of crises, a person or patient may have the resources 
              of his or her own religion as a support. Nevertheless, I have found 
              in my experience as a carer and counsellor that although religious 
              faith may help people bear spiritual pain, it seldom takes it away. 
              To help someone with religious needs we do not necessarily have 
              to share that faith, but we can help by being more understanding 
              and respectful toward their chosen faith and try and ensure that 
              their religious needs are met. Spiritual care requires an understanding 
              of the patient's unique philosophical or religious views. It requires 
              respect and understanding for the patient's belief and practices 
              even though they are different to those providing the care. In order 
              to attain this level of understanding, the carer must establish 
              rapport and trust which allows the patient to disclose those beliefs. 
              The carer should also be willing to recognise limitations in their 
              understanding of these beliefs and seek outside help as necessary. 
            <p><b>Spiritual Needs: what is to be understood?<br>
              </b>Spiritual needs can be broadly categorised as the need for meaning 
              and purpose in life, the need for love and harmonious relationships 
              with humans, living entities and God, the need for forgiveness, 
              the need for a source of hope and strength, the need for trust, 
              the need for expression of personal beliefs and values, and the 
              need for spiritual practices, expression of an understanding of 
              God and/or a deity and creation. 
            <p>Meaning in the context of spirituality can be defined as the reason 
              given to a particular life experience by the individual, bringing 
              about a sense of purpose from their life and illness. There is evidence 
              to suggest that patients struggle with finding a source of meaning 
              and purpose in their lives. It is also suggested that people with 
              a sense of meaning and purpose survive more readily in difficult 
              circumstances. The experience of suffering can bring about meaning 
              and purpose to our lives. It is interesting to note that there is 
              a distinction between the religious and the apparently non-religious 
              person in the way they approach spirituality. A non-religious person's 
              spiritual needs are more often focused around themselves and others. 
              The religious person experiences their spirituality more around 
              their relationship with a deity or God. However, those who have 
              strong religious convictions and sense of God, may still need encouragement 
              to adapt to unexpected changes when they are facing death. 
            <p align=LEFT>It is important for carers to understand the fundamental 
              needs of individuals. The need for love and harmonious relationships 
              go hand in hand with a need for meaning and purpose. Unconditional 
              love<a href="#11">[11]</a><a name="_ednref11"></a> is usually the 
              prime requirement for a person suffering from spiritual pain. The 
              symptoms of the need for unconditional love are self-pity, depression, 
              insecurity, isolation and fear. Unconditional love transforms these 
              symptoms into feelings of self-worth, joy, security, belonging, 
              hope and courage. 
            <p> One of the most effective processes that can release a patient 
              from suffering is forgiveness, and carers can be part of this healing 
              process by gently encouraging this process in an individual. Nothing 
              clutters a life more than resentment, remorse and recrimination. 
              These three emotional responses to life are based on anger, guilt 
              and hostility. Untreated, these can manifest themselves in physical 
              illness. When held in the mind and in the heart, they occupy a fearsome 
              amount of space, colouring our perception of reality to an alarmingly 
              large degree. Forgiveness allows the individual to neutralise the 
              toxic emotional investment. The process of forgiveness requires 
              the individual to examine the reasons for their negative emotions 
              and to deal with them, thus freeing them from self-destructive emotions. 
              The consequences of not forgiving are high. The person who carries 
              anger and hate carries a toxic attitude of resentment into his or 
              her relationships with others and ultimately themselves. 
            <p>I have only touched upon some of the fundamental needs of individuals, 
              and the ways in which carers can help those who are spiritually 
              distressed. Suffice to say that the spiritually distressed person 
              needs an environment that conveys this trust. Such an environment 
              is one that demonstrates that carers make themselves accessible 
              to others, both physically and emotionally. Trusting is the ability 
              to place confidence in the trustworthiness of others and this is 
              essential for spiritual health. 
            <p><b>How is spiritual care administered? <br>
              </b>Any interpretation of the word 'spiritual' can present confusion 
              when discussed outside the framework of religion or beyond one's 
              personal belief systems. Likewise, the concepts of spiritual care 
              become even more elusive when a non-dogmatic approach to spirituality 
              attempts to explain a dimension of health care that is provided 
              by a variety of professional disciplines and lay people. The terms 
              'religious care' and 'spiritual care' are frequently used synonymously. 
              Religious care can be spiritual care but spiritual care is not necessarily 
              religious care. Out of the five types of pain: physical, psychological, 
              social, emotional and spiritual, religious suffering comes under 
              the last category. 
            <p align=LEFT>From my work with dying patients in a hospice environment, 
              I developed a typology of five religious preferences. It is interesting 
              that the majority of these classifications are devoid of religious 
              doctrine: atheism, metaphysics, personal religion, personal religion 
              combined with institutional religion, and institutional religion 
              alone.<a href="#12">[12]</a><a name="_ednref12"></a> This separation 
              of doctrine from religion, but not from personal faith, may serve 
              as a first step in distinguishing religiosity from spiritual orientation. 
            <p><b>How is spiritual care to be evaluated? <br>
              </b>The patient, who experiences spiritual integrity and demonstrates 
              this integrity through reality-based tranquillity or peace, or through 
              the development of meaningful, purposeful behaviour, displays a 
              restored sense of spiritual integrity. The overall evaluation of 
              spiritual care should establish the degree to which spiritual pain 
              was relieved. The patient's communication and interaction may also 
              indicate spiritual growth through greater understanding of life 
              or an acceptance and creativity within a particular situation. 
            <p

 align=LEFT>Spiritual care enables carers to provide more holistic care for patients, 
              as Cousins points out, ' Death and dying are not the ultimate tragedy 
              of life. The ultimate tragedy of life is depersonalisation, separated 
              from the spiritual nourishment . . .'<a href="#13">[13]</a><a name="_ednref13"></a> 
              The ability to address spiritual issues is no longer a matter of 
              choice, but rather it is fundamental to providing holistic medical 
              care to the terminally ill. 
            <p><b>What is the role of the interdisciplinary team?<br>
              </b>As hospice care attempts to provide holistic care to persons 
              nearing the end of their life, there is a wide agreement that this 
              care ought to include a dimension that is best described as 'spiritual'.<a href="#14">[14]</a><a name="_ednref14"></a> 
              Though few agree on the commonalties of the spiritual dimension, 
              many caregivers in my experience profess ability and a satisfaction 
              in providing such care. 
            <p>The continued lack of clarity in understanding what is meant by 
              'spiritual care' however, prevents the development of meaningful 
              criteria upon which to base a measurement. Inevitably, attitudes 
              concerning the role of spiritual care rarely achieve conformity. 
              If it is the aim of a hospice to provide holistic care, its potential 
              to achieve this rests on the ability of caregivers to assist patients 
              and families in finding hope and reconciliation during the last 
              days of life. Carers need to be prepared for this role. 
            <p align=LEFT>In delivering physical, psycho-social and spiritual 
              patient care, caregivers must recognise their strengths and limitations. 
              In Highfield and Cason's study of spiritual needs in cancer patients, 
              it was reported that the only problems that the respondents confidently 
              associated with a spiritual dimension were concerned with the meaning 
              of suffering, death or God.<a href="#15">[15]</a><a

 name="_ednref15"></a> The nurses' inability to distinguish spiritual problems 
              from psycho-social ones led to inappropriate interventions that 
              implied that the needs of these patients were not met. This data 
              clearly demonstrates that carers must be trained to recognise the 
              various types of care a patient will need-when facing terminal illness 
              they cannot abdicate their responsibility to treat an individual's 
              spiritual needs to the chaplain, any more than they can abdicate 
              their responsibility for a patient's physical care to the physician. 
              These requirements for a hospice nurse are not unrealistic, various 
              studies have reported such as Amenta, (1984), Chariboga et al. (1983) 
              and Vincent and Peace (1986), that hospice nurses tend to posses 
              stronger beliefs in a life after death, and were frequently characterised 
              as being more assertive, imaginative and independent than nurses 
              working in more structured environments. <a href="#16">[16]</a><a name="_ednref16"></a> 
            <p><b>What does this mean for ISKCON?<br>
              </b>As ISKCON prepares to provide care for the terminally ill at 
              major places of pilgrimage, such as Mayapura and Vrndavana, it would 
              be useful for the Social Development Ministry, the Health and Welfare 
              Ministry and the Ministry for Education to consider the issues raised 
              in this article. An earlier attempt in 1995-6 to provide informal 
              'hospice care' for dying devotees in Vrndavan, India, accentuated 
              the need for such specialised care to form part of our social development 
              and health and welfare programmes. In the past devotees with a terminal 
              diagnosis have been brought to Vrindavana, under the impression 
              that they could comfortably prepare to spend their last days at 
              this place of pilgrimage. However, those who were offering this 
              care (with the best intentions) were unfortunately ill equipped 
              both medically, psychologically and spiritually to deal with the 
              many challenges a carer has to face when dealing with the inevitable 
              trauma of death. 
            <p align=LEFT>We as a Society need to examine our attitude towards 
              the care that we need to provide the terminally ill in our midst. 
              Our scriptures teach us that spiritual pain is ultimately a symptom 
              of the individual's forgetfulness of, and subsequent separation 
              from, God. Therefore, the Bhagavad-Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam recommend 
              spiritual care as a process of devotional service to God, with chanting 
              His names as the primary practice.<a href="#17">[17]</a><a name="_ednref17"></a> 
              We need to become more sensitive and better equipped to deal with 
              the need of terminally ill devotees and more realistic in our care 
              approach. A devotee who has come to a holy land to prepare for and 
              face death may have spent many years preparing for this event through 
              their spiritual practices, however, this does not necessarily mean 
              they will be able to face death without the necessary medical, emotional 
              and psychological support from suitably trained devotees. Experience 
              shows me that it is imperative that, unless devotees are trained 
              in palliative, terminal and hospice care, dying devotees are best 
              cared for by medical professionals outside of ISKCON. This care 
              can be provided in consultation and co-operation with the dying 
              devotee's loved ones. Suitably trained devotees can be active in 
              the capacity of pastoral support, together with friends and family. 
            <p>To achieve these goals it would be prudent to introduce a training 
              programme in palliative and spiritual care. Such a programme has 
              the potential to empower devotees with the relevant qualifications 
              to mindfully administer, help and support those devotees in need 
              of spiritual care, living or dying. Until such an internal educational 
              programme is set up, it would be wise for those devotees who wish 
              to serve the Society by taking care of the dying, to take advantage 
              of the training opportunities outside of ISKCON. 
            <p>ISKCON already has a wealth of devotees trained, qualified and 
              experienced in subjects directly and indirectly related to spiritual 
              care. It would be a very useful resource if the various Ministries 
              compile a database of devotees qualified and experienced in this 
              field to bring their resources together. It is recommended that 
              even these devotees broaden their existing knowledge base by gaining 
              further education in palliative and terminal care. 
            <p>ISKCON has already taken some steps in the right direction. There 
              is a planned hospice and residential home in Vrndavana, India and 
              concrete progress has been made with the founding of Bhaktivedanta 
              Hospital in Mumbai, India. Holistic care, and this includes spiritual 
              care, is embraced in the hospital's mission statement: ' With love 
              and devotion we will offer everyone a modern, scientific, holistic 
              health care service, based on true awareness and understanding of 
              the needs of the body, mind and soul.' This project has confirmed 
              plans for its own palliative care unit being set-up in co-operation 
              with medical institutes in London, England and this is an encouraging 
              sign that we are beginning to respond to the need for systematic

                love is a love that is given freely, without expecting anything 
                in return. It is both unselfish and non-judgmental. Among Vaisnavas 
                and members of ISKCON the epitomy of love is that between the 
                Lord and His devotees.
