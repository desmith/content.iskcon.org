            <p align=LEFT>As many readers of this journal know, there has been 
              considerable media interest generated by my article, &quot;Child 
              Abuse in the Hare Krishna Movement: 1971-1986.&quot; Although I 
              anticipated some interest on the part of the media, I never imagined 
              the extent of media coverage that was to occur. In this short essay 
              I want to reflect further on the issue of child abuse in ISKCON 
              and address the publicity generated by my article. I also want to 
              comment briefly about what has happened within ISKCON in the wake 
              of widespread understanding that children were previously abused 
              in the movement's schools. 
            <p align=LEFT>I would like first to draw the readers attention to 
              the title of the original article. The dates, &quot;1971-1986&quot; 
              are significant. The paper I wrote is ultimately historical. It 
              tells about child abuse within the context of an institution (the 
              ashram-gurukula) that, for all practical purposes, no longer exists 
              within ISKCON. Apart from two schools in India and a small secondary 
              school for young women in Florida, there are no ashram-based schools 
              remaining. Yet some in the media, and therefore the public, have 
              implicitly and wrongly assumed that child abuse is a recent or present 
              problem within ISKCON. I have no evidence to support such a view 
              and I certainly never cited any in my article. While it may be true 
              that some ISKCON children presently face abuse, there is no reason 
              to assume that the incidence of abuse or the circumstances under 
              which it takes place in any way differ from mainstream societies. 
              My point here is that the story told in my paper is about the past, 
              not about the present or some projected future. It is a report that 
              represents an excursion in historical sociology. 
            <p align=LEFT>I suspect many people believe that the story emerged 
              on the front page of the New York Times simply because child abuse 
              and religion is always &quot;news.&quot; Obviously child abuse within 
              various religious groups and denominations, such as the Catholic 
              Church, has created headline making stories in recent years. Yet, 
              in the present case, this is only one aspect of the story, and not 
              necessarily the most significant one. I find it interestingly ironic 
              that a story about child abuse and the Hare Krishna movement would 
              appear on the front page of the Times on the very day that the headline 
              revealed an &quot;open-ended impeachment inquiry&quot; of President 
              Clinton. Here we have a headline story about a President who apparently 
              lied under oath about his own sexual conduct. At the bottom of the 
              same front page we have another story about a &quot;controversial&quot; 
              religious group that is telling the truth about past child abuse. 
              In other words the President of the United States, whom we might 
              assume would be forthright and honest, was lying to the American 
              people while the Hare Krishna's were telling the truth about a dark 
              part of their past. I can only guess that the Times editors were 
              aware of this irony and, precisely because of it, chose to put the 
              child abuse story on the front page with the byline &quot;Hare Krishna 
              Movement Details Past Abuse at Its Boarding Schools&quot; (see New 
              York Times, Friday, October 9, 1998). Indeed the story here was 
              largely about the surprising willingness of a &quot;controversial&quot; 
              religious group to tell the truth, even when an American President 
              apparently wouldn't. Many many members of the media, who called 
              me for interviews about my paper, including the New York Times reporter, 
              started by asking, &quot;Why did the Hare Krishnas come forward 
              with this story about child abuse in their own journal? Why would 
              they tell the world about such a troubling part of their past?&quot; 
              To most journalists this was the story. Without this news angle, 
              I think there is every reason to believe that the child abuse story 
              would have been a page three article, or even buried in the religion 
              section of the newspaper. Yet making the front page of the Times 
              signaled to the worldwide media that this was a major story which 
              obligated them to cover. 
            <p align=LEFT>Let me reflect further on a few other matters neither 
              included in my article, nor fully in the accompanying one by Bharata 
              Shrestha Das. First let me say that I am, and have been, a member 
              of ISKCON's North American Board of Education. I was asked to take 
              on this position in 1991. At the time I was researching for another 
              book on the movement dealing with family life and ISKCON's second 
              generation. Because of this, some educators who were members of 
              the Board thought I might be able to contribute usefully to their 
              efforts to improve education within ISKCON. After some initial hesitation 
              I decided to take their invitation. 
            <p align=LEFT>Because of my participation on ISKCON's Board of Education, 
              and from my own research, I have come to appreciate the commitment 
              of ISKCON's educators toward the movement's children. During a time 
              when resources are scarce throughout the movement, it has often 
              proven difficult for ISKCON's educators, and others committed to 
              improving ISKCON's schools, to make needed changes. Despite challenging 
              circumstances improvements have been made, with an eye toward protecting 
              children and making them productive citizens. ISKCON now has an 
              International Office for Child Protection, it screens candidates 
              for teaching positions in ISKCON schools and children, movement-wide, 
              are taught about child abuse and what they should do if someone 
              mistreats them emotionally, physically, or sexually. Moreover, when 
              an ISKCON school has been found lacking in its efforts to protect 
              children, it faces probation or, in one instance, has been pressured 
              by the leadership to close down, or face being decertified as an 
              official ISKCON school. The movement's leadership has also been 
              a force behind the creation and funding of &quot;Children of Krishna&quot; 
              an organization whose purpose is to help young people who were formerly 
              students in ISKCON's ashram-based gurukulas. Because of this initiative, 
              young men and women abused as children have been helped with counseling, 
              funds for vocational training, college study, and the like. The 
              tragedy of child abuse within ISKCON has thus resulted in a number 
              of positive changes that have helped protect ISKCON's children, 
              and lent support to those young men and women abused years earlier. 
            <p align=LEFT>Yet child abuse has been directly instrumental in bringing 
              about a fundamental change in ISKCON's identity and purpose as a 
              religious organization. As I said in my article, child abuse occurred 
              within ISKCON in part because children and families weren't sufficiently 
              valued. This has changed considerably in recent years. Within ISKCON 
              communities worldwide one hears a great deal about &quot;social 
              development.&quot; Social development has become a mantra recited 
              over and over by devotees in and outside of ISKCON. What social 
              development means quite simply is the support of family life. How 
              can ISKCON find ways to better integrate and meaningfully support 
              families in its communities? This year, ISKCON's Governing Body 
              Commission (GBC) created a new ministry devoted specifically to 
              social development. Also created in recent years; the Grhastha Ministry, 
              the Youth Ministry, and the Women's Ministry, all were established 
              to respond to the needs of parents, women, and children. These and 
              other efforts are directed toward bringing family life into the 
              mainstream of ISKCON, culturally and religiously. And, in fact, 
              as I have argued elsewhere, ISKCON's fundamental unit of social 
              organization today is the family; communalism having given way to 
              the nuclear family in most locations. Without meaning to suggest 
              that child abuse, by itself, brought about these changes, there 
              still can be little doubt that it has forced leaders and rank and 
              file members alike to rethink what ISKCON represents as a religious 
              organization. Married people and their children have increasingly 
              come to the front and center of ISKCON life. Indeed they represent 
              the movement's future. 
            <p align=LEFT>I know many ISKCON members have been dismayed and distressed 
              by the publicity generated by my article in ISKCON Communication 
              Journal. I also have been taken-back by the reaction. I think it 
              important to be reminded however that the publicity generated was 
              as much a result of ISKCON's candor about what happened as with 
              the child abuse that occurred. Now, I believe, ISKCON must go forward 
              full-steam in its efforts to protect children and build a system 
              of education that nurtures the lives of ISKCON's future hope. Like 
              you, I pray that this will be the lasting legacy of child abuse 
              within the Hare Krishna movement. All best wishes.
