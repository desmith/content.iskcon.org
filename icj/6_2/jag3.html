 align=LEFT>The foregoing discussion shows that Prabhupada admitted the existence 
              of an entity known as Hinduism, though he takes the orthodox position 
              of eschewing the non-traditional term 'Hindu', insisting on <i>sanatana-dharma 
              </i>as the correct nomenclature. Ironically, such traditionality 
              makes him much more 'Hindu' (if we give the term the meaning of 
              adhering to a set of classical Sanskrit texts) than his detractors.<a href="#e26">[</a><a name="26"></a><a href="#e26">26]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>A word is a tool which we use or reject for various 
              reasons. It is insufficient to say that Prabhupada was making a 
              semantic point that Hindu is an incorrect term. Languages are living 
              organisms which undergo change and any attempt to dictate usage 
              and purify language of foreign terms is generally a losing battle. 
              Sanskritisation of modern Indian vernaculars has only been partially 
              successful-the elites continue to use English words even where Sanskritised 
              equivalents exist or have been created. Many of these borrowed words 
              have filtered into the everyday vocabulary of even illiterate labourers 
              and cannot be found in the dictionaries, though their usage is entrenched. 
              For example one only has to think of the ubiquitous <i>saide </i> 
              (from English 'side') of the Nabadwip rikshaw-wallah. This is consistent 
              with Sanskrit hermeneutics, where the accepted usage of word has 
              predominance over its etymology (<i>rudhi-yogarthayo rudhih</i>). 
            <p align=LEFT>There is certainly no confusion for the outsider. He 
              takes the Krsna consciousness movement at face value, concluding 
              that many of the practices of its members are similar to those that 
              consider themselves Hindu. This might be called <i>hamsa-nyaya</i>: 
              'If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck'. This 
              of course assumes that there is intuitively such an entity as Hinduism, 
              beyond the ethnic or geographical sense of its original application. 
              Reverence for the Veda should be sufficient to establish this, but 
              there is so much more of the common Hindu heritage in Krsna consciousness 
              that it seems almost foolhardy for Prabhupada to attempt to divorce 
              himself from it. Whether it be <i>kirtan, bhajan,</i> deity worship, 
              <i>prasada, </i>fire sacrifice, <i> varnasrama, </i>the Vedas, or 
              the <i>Bhagavad-gita, </i>the concepts are all familiar to a Hindu 
              of any tradition, who recognises them as having religious significance. 
              Indeed, irrespective of Prabhupada's claim that Krsna is not a Hindu 
              god but God Himself, to the outsider, Krsna will always be a Hindu 
              god. Inasmuch as all the great religious traditions are essentially 
              symbolic languages, this common heritage cannot be dismissed as 
              insignificant. Nor should the ethnic aspects of Hinduism be entirely 
              dismissed. Does not Prabhupada betray his Hinduness when he quotes 
              Krsnadasa Kaviraja<i>: bharata bhumite haila manunya janma jar, 
              janma sarthak kari' karo para-upakar</i>? 'Anyone who takes birth 
              in India should make his life perfect and help others by distributing 
              the fruits of love given by Caitanya Mahaprabhu'. Or when he says 
              that India is the place of Krsna's birth and therefore special? 
              After all, Savarkar says that a Hindu is anyone who 'feels attachment 
              to the land that extends from Sindhu to Sindhu as the land of his 
              forefathers-as his fatherland'.<a href="#e27">[</a><a name="27"></a><a href="#e27">27]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>But a debate over terms is never what it seems at face 
              value. It would seem that Prabhupada is ready to concede that any 
              battle for the term 'Hindu' (if it were worth fighting) has been 
              lost to the neo-Hindus, ethnic nationalists and religious chauvinists. 
              For <i>sanatana-dharma, </i>on the other hand, the battle can still 
              be won.<i> </i>Prabhupada recognises that the term 'Hindu' resonates 
              with ethnicity and he cannot accept it as valid from his vantage 
              point as a transcendentalist. 
            <p align=LEFT>We are dealing then with a problem of ethnic and universal 
              aspects of the word 'Hindu'. Prabhupada wanted to distance himself 
              from the geographical or national limitations of the word to stress 
              the universal essence of <i>sanatana-dharma </i>in order to attract 
              everyone in the world to his movement. But Prabhupada has another, 
              intermediate understanding of Hinduism as <i>varnasrama-dharma, 
              </i>which though still 'on the bodily platform' is the most perfect 
              socio-religious system and therefore an integral part of <i>sanatana-dharma. 
              </i>Prabhupada's position is well-summarised by one of Prabhupada's 
              leading disciples: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Hinduism is a tradition which seeks to transcend itself, 
                and must do so, to remain faithful to the Vedas, broadly understood. 
                This perfection is embodied in Srila Prabhupada. Hinduism includes 
                'mundane' <i>karma-kanda</i> and an external <i>varnasrama </i>system 
                which have as a final goal the complete transcendence of such 
                external and mundane procedures. Thus the perfection of Hinduism 
                is to realise that one is not a Hindu or any other worldly designation. 
                The <i>Caitanya-caritamrta </i>and Prabhupada's own teachings 
                exemplify this simultaneous identification with and transcendence 
                of Hinduism.<a href="#e28">[28]</a><a name="28"></a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Such an approach was not original to Prabhupada. Indeed, 
              previous Hindu missionaries blazed the trail before him, presenting 
              their understanding of the universal religious principle beyond 
              bodily designations. They also saw Hinduism as a tradition which 
              transcended itself. Even Savarkar states that 'a Hindu is most intensely 
              so when he ceases to be Hindu'.<a href="#e29">[29]</a><a name="29"></a> 
              In other words, when he transcends his own Hinduism. Prabhupada's 
              point of departure was the same as theirs: 'we are not this body'. 
              Prabhupada's discourse on transcending religious or mundane designation 
              echoes that of Vivekananda Swami, that it is unconstructive for 
              an individual's spiritual progress to excessively identify with 
              one's external labelling: 'I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own 
              little well and thinking that the whole world is my little well. 
              The Christian sits in his little well and thinks the whole world 
              is his well. The Muhammadan sits in his little well and thinks that 
              this is the whole world.' <a href="#e30">[</a><a name="30"></a><a href="#e30">30]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT> Another element of Vivekananda's discourse, that all 
              humans possess the same religious instinct, the same urge to spiritual 
              perfection, to return to the same unique source, is also shared. 
              'As the different streams having their sources in different places 
              all mingle their water in the sea, so O Lord, the different paths 
              which men take through different tendencies, various though they 
              appear, crooked or straight, all lead to thee.'<a href="#e31">[31]</a><a name="31"></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>It is at this point, however, that Prabhupada diverges 
              from his predecessors, for he defines the universal religious principle 
              in terms of love of a personal God. With this message, Prabhupada 
              is in harmony with a theological debate which goes back over a thousand 
              years of Hindu history, though this message was barely being heard 
              outside of India, as <i>advaita-vada </i>was accepted as normative 
              for modern Hinduism. Prabhupada was unique in his success in bringing 
              this message to those outside of the Indian sub-continent. 
            <p align=LEFT>Vivekananda introduced Hinduism to the western world 
              by saying that all paths lead to God. In the end, however, he was 
              arguing for a hierarchy of religious understanding that placed his 
              monistic or <i>advaitin </i>understanding at the pinnacle of spiritual 
              advancement. Prabhupada followed the same route to argue that his 
              anthropomorphic theism was the ultimate object of all religions, 
              realised imperfectly in all but the 'postgraduate course' of Krsna 
              consciousness. Prabhupada consistently rejected the understanding 
              that the symbolic language of Krsnaism is temporally conditioned. 
              It is not just another '-ism' (770402RC.BOM). He claimed that Krsna 
              consciousness cannot be sectarian because it takes Krsna as a whole, 
              without trying to deprive Him of attributes true to Him as the complete 
              whole. 
            <p align=LEFT>Though for Prabhupada this is the ultimate end of <i>sanatana-dharma, 
              </i>neo-Hinduism itself does not recognise it. It wishes to place 
              worship of Krsna on an equal footing with the worship of Devi or 
              Siva or other gods as just another aspect of an ultimately formless 
              Being or truth (Brahman). Thus Prabhupada is suspicious of the Hindus, 
              taking an attitude not unlike that of the other religious minorities 
              in India who resisted Radhakrsnan's report on university education 
              for fear that their religions would be taught in a way 'determined 
              by the doctrinal assumptions of neo-Hinduism'.<a href="#e32">[ </a><a name="32"></a><a href="#e32">32]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>This rejection of Hindu '<i>maya-vada</i>' is so strong 
              in Prabhupada and his tradition that he can even say that Christianity 
              and Islam are Vaisnava in spirit because of their common theism. 
              He is ready to acknowledge that Christians, as theists, 'have some 
              idea' and even talks about creating a common front with theists 
              everywhere against atheism which he believes, as we have seen, to 
              begin with the impersonal conception of God.<a href="#e33">[</a><a name="33"></a><a href="#e33">33]</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>And Krsna consciousness is self-consciously everything 
              that the neo-Hindus resist (or have 'transcended') in their own 
              heritage: idol-worship, anthropomorphism, mythology run rampant. 
              In short, with the exception of the dynamic caste system, it is 
              everything that they would have seen as particular and not universal 
              about Hinduism! 
            <p align=LEFT>In view of this thoroughgoing rejection of 'normative' 
              Hinduism, how can we justify Prabhupada's occasional profession 
              of Hindu identity in a seemingly cynical, utilitarian fashion? One 
              either is or is not a Hindu. One cannot both be, and not be, according 
              to one's convenience. In fact, however, this may not be the case. 
              Is it possible that Prabhupada could simultaneously, inconceivably 
              possess both identities? R.C. Zaehner considers it to be a characteristic 
              of Hinduism that it resists the 'either/or' approach, describing 
              it as essentially a religion of 'both/and'<a name="34"></a><a href="#e34">[34]</a> 
              Arvind Sharma similarly states that it seems to be a characteristic 
              of Hinduism that the whole is equal to the sum of the parts, 'In 
              a Hindu version of the Christian view that Jesus was fully man and 
              fully God, one could claim that one is both an Advaitin (or a Visistadvaitin 
              or a Dvaitin) and a Hindu at the same time or a Hindu as well as 
              a Vaisnava, a Sakta or a Saiva at the same time.'<a name="35"></a><a href="#e35">[35]</a> 
            <p>This seems to be what Prabhupada is saying in one lecture (681110SB.LA) 
              in which he quotes Caitanya Mahaprabhu's verse: 
            <p align=CENTER><i>naha vipro na ca nara-patir napi vaisyo na sudro<br>
              &nbsp;nahaà varni na ca grha-patir no vanastho yatir va<br>

              &nbsp;gopi-bhartuù pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasaù</i> 
            <ul>
              <p

 align=LEFT>'I am not a <i>brahmana, </i>I am not a <i>ksatriya, </i>I am not 
                a <i>vaisya </i>or a <i>Sudra. </i>Nor am I a <i>brahmacari, </i>a 
                householder, a <i>vanaprastha </i>or a <i>sannyasi. </i>I identify 
                Myself only as the servant of the servant of the servant of the 
                lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, the maintainer of the <i>gopis. 
                </i>He is like an ocean of nectar, and He is the cause of universal 
                transcendental bliss. He is always existing with brilliance.' 
                (CC Madhya 13.80) 
            </ul>
            <p

 align=LEFT>Caitanya Mahaprabhu, situated at the very pinnacle of the Hindu <i>varnaSrama-dharma</i> 
              as a brahmana and sannyasi, stated that his identity as a servant 
              of Krsna transcended all these bodily identifications. And yet, 
              despite His exemplary transcendence of Hinduism, Caitanya Mahaprabhu's 
              'civil disobedience movement' against the Kazi's repression of <i>sankirtan 
              </i>was identified as a Hindu action. Thus referring to precedents 
              from Mahaprabhu's own life, Hrdayananda dasa Goswami comments: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>It is said that we invoke Hinduism in time of danger, 
                but the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta </i>shows that this is precisely 
                what 'Hindus' have always done. Thus the Saivas, Vaisnavas, etc, 
                who clearly opposed each other theologically, were all labelled 
                'Hindus' by the sometimes hostile Muslim society, and for practical 
                purposes, even in Lord Caitanya's movement, operated under this 
                rubric.<a name="36"></a><a href="#e36">[36]</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In fact, there is no real conflict, hypocrisy or double 
              standard, for Prabhupada has never rejected <i>sanatana-dharma</i>. 
              Those who for convenience share the rubric 'Hindu' have a common 
              ideal of <i>sanatana-dharma, </i>even if they can not agree on what 
              it means. 
            <p align=CENTER><b>XIV.</b> 
            <p align=LEFT>So, where does this leave the Krsna consciousness movement? 
              The situation has changed a great deal since the end of Prabhupada's 
              personal leadership in 1977. In Western Europe and North America, 
              the movement's influence has waned amongst those of European origin. 
              At the same time, the Indian Diaspora in the West has gained numbers 
              in ISKCON's membership. Furthermore, the Society has become more 
              self-confident and less defensive about its Hinduness-in no small 
              part due to the success of ISKCON and other transplanted Hindu movements 
              in these regions. Though there is a continuing unease in ISKCON's 
              relationship with the Hindu diaspora-orthodoxy and ethnicity are 
              continually an issue, either spoken or unspoken in ISKCON communities-the 
              Society remains more and more dependent on the Indian community's 
              financial support. By vociferously denying its Hinduness, ISKCON 
              risks alienating its principal constituency. In view of the above 
              discussion, freedom from the designation Hindu seems a small gain 
              for the costs of such an alienation. The Society will certainly 
              find it easier to transmit its understanding from a point of common 
              understanding with the Indian community by becoming more inclusive, 
              rather than by taking an exclusive or conflicting approach. 
            <p align=LEFT>In India, the situation is not so dissimilar to the 
              one described above. The movement is becoming more and more dependent 
              on its Indian membership. The problem here is that if Krsna consciousness 
              is to operate under the rubric of 'Hindu', it must be under its 
              own terms. In view of its international character, it cannot allow 
              itself to become implicated in narrow ethnic understanding of Hinduism. 
              There is always the possibility, however, in the Indian political 
              atmosphere, that the Krsna consciousness movement will favour the 
              possible advantages which would accrue to it if there were a government 
              favourable to its missionary goals. 
            <p align=LEFT>It is hard to see how Prabhupada's idea of a 'Vedic 
              secular state' on <i>varnaSrama </i> lines would be any more liberated 
              from problems than those which would accrue from any other state 
              interference in religion. He advised government involvement in the 
              religious practice of all religious denominations, but on his terms, 
              from his perspective. A Christian would surely not like to be told 
              that because the Bible says, 'Thou shalt not kill', he is henceforth 
              forbidden to eat meat. I believe, however, that Prabhupada was more 
              practical than this-he recognised that neither religion nor good 
              manners can be imposed from above: 'There is only one religion in 
              the world to be followed by one and all and that is the <i>Bhagavata-dharma, 
              </i>or the religion which teaches one to worship the Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead and no one else' (SB 1.2.27). Thus this ideal may be 
              held by the devotees of Krsna, they must choose between the long 
              tradition of liberty and tolerance of disparate belief in Hinduism, 
              and the zealous missionary spirit which puts them in the midst of 
              other competitive missionary religions. 
            <p>Religion, like language, is arguably universal, comparable to Chomsky's 
              concept of innate language. But the argument that language is innate 
              cannot justify the claim that any one existing language, be it English 
              or Sanskrit, is the original archetype of which all other languages 
              are derivatives or reflections. It is similarly impossible to prove, 
              though one may believe, that any one religious system more accurately 
              reflects the innate religious faculty. In the modern era, whatever 
              the deeply held beliefs of any religious community, it is necessary 
              to adapt to the pluralistic character of world society. This is 
              a contract of tolerance, the like of which has existed in India 
              since ancient times. Indeed, religious tolerance is considered to 
              be a preeminent characteristic of the Hindu family of religions, 
              a certain 'live and let live' in terms of religious ideology. Christians 
              and Muslims are thought by Hindus to break that engagement due to 
              their exclusivism. Does Vaisnavism similarly want to break that 
              contract with the rest of Hinduism in the name of its particular 
              revelation? Christianity and Islam are struggling with the question 
              of relativism and revelation which comes out of engagement with 
              a pluralistic world. Perhaps, Vaisnavism's participation in the 
              'united front for theism' will depend greatly on how far it can 
              develop the liberal spirit <br>
              that is compatible with such ecumenism.

                The research for this paper has been based almost entirely on 
                the Folio database 'The Complete Works of His Divine Grace A.C. 
                Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada' (n.d.) and the Folio database

                Prabhupada', Version 1.0, March 1995. References to printed books 
                are coded as follows: BG = Bhagavad-gita, CC = Caitanya-caritamrta, 
                JSD = Journey of Self Discovery, KB = Krsna Book, NOD = Nectar 
                of Devotion, SB = Srimad Bhagavatam, SSR = The Science of Self-realization. 
                These are followed by either a page reference or a verse reference. 
                The letter P following verse numbers indicates Prabhupada's purport 
                to the verse in question. Personal letters are coded according 
                to the date and a three-letter extension designating the recipient. 
                Room conversations (RC, R2, R3, etc.), lectures (LE), interviews 
                (IV), morning walks (MW), meetings (ME) are indicated with the 
                date and a three-letter extension indicating the place. Thus, 
                770528ME.VRN indicates a meeting in Vrndavana on 28, May 1977; 
                660302BG.NY indicates a Bhagavad-gita class given in New York 
                on 2, March 1966. Some quotations have been slightly edited for 
                clarity. The study was based on a search through the more than 
                two thousand occurrences of the word 'Hindu' and 'Hinduism'. Thus, 
                these words can be found in nearly all the citations found in 
                this document, even though the arguments given in them may have 
                been presented in a more coherent fashion elsewhere in the Folio

                recognised that both 'India' and 'Hindu' have the same origins, 
                though he seems to think that the words originated with the Muslims. 
                In fact, the original version of the word (Hind'ush) is first 
                found in two monuments inscriptions of Darius in Iran, which date 
                from 486 B. C. See Fr. Spiegel. Die altpersische Keilinschriften,

                introduced it into Greek (History iii, 98). The separation of 
                'Indian' from 'Hindu' is still a fairly recent development in 
                European languages. The earliest use of the word in Indian sources 
                is in the Sarngadhara-paddhati, from the thirteenth century, where 
                one verse says that the Hindus fled to the Vindhya Mountains to 
                escape the Muslims. The words hindu and hinduyani are found in 
                the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 17) when the Kazi takes notice of 
                sankirtana as a Hindu religious activity. The Kazi is quoted by 
                Kaviraja as saying to Mahaprabhu, 'You are the great god of the 
                Hindus, Narayana' (Adi 17.215). See also, Joseph O'Connell, 'The

                spoke out against democracy, which he considered to be close to 
                mob rule since the general populace could not be trusted to make 
                decisions in their spiritual interest. He called it 'rogues and

                The Bhagavata adopts many ancient authorities to speak for the 
                Vaisnava doctrine, not only traditional Puranic authorities, Vyasa, 
                Suta, Suka, etc., Maitreya, the characters of the Mahabharata,

                Prabhupada rejected outright Gandhi's solution for the untouchable 
                problem, decrying it as merely rubber-stamping them as harijanas 
                without any true character reform by which they would become true 
                'people of God' as the word harijana indicates (661223CC.NY; 770410R2.BOM).

                Interestingly, however, while discussing the education of sudras 
                in his varnasrama system, Prabhupada approves of the idea of limiting 
                the education of lower castes. 
              <p>In India the caste system was very good. From the very beginning 
                the children would learn the technology of the father. Just like 
                the potter's children. The potter's children would also make a 
                small bird, a small fruit, or small playing utensils-small glasses 
                or plates-which would then be sold. They would be purchased by 
                other children. In this way, the whole family used to earn something. 
                Nowadays they're sent to school, wasting time, and then unemployment 
                and idle brain. What is the use of sending a potter's son to school?

                by devotees taking over an empty Hindu temple in South Africa.

                This is a rival school of thought to the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition

                Even though in his books, Prabhupada frequently translates the 
                word nastika by the English 'atheist', he defines it as someone 
                who does not believe in the Vedas. In his conversations, however, 
                an atheist is often anyone who does not accept Krsna as God. Nastika 
                is found in CC Madhya 5.87 to mean one not believing in isvara, 
                and in CC Madhya 6.186. Pasandi Sankaracarya is said to have written 
                an atheistic philosophy (CC Madhya 6.180).

                refused to take the political route through the Jan Sangh, but 
                saw it as an opportunity for vigorous preaching (Lilamrta 5, 201).

                E., India as a Secular State, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton 
                University Press, 1963. 'There is a real danger that the &quot;no-preference&quot; 
                doctrine may be used to justify state promotion of a syncretic 
                &quot;Universal Religion of Man&quot; which is nevertheless based 
                on Hindu assumptions. This tendency was clearly revealed in the 
                Radhakrishnan report on university education.' Prabhupada's feelings 
                about S. Radhakrishnan have already been revealed earlier in this 
                work. By 'Hindu assumptions' we understand, evidently, 'advaitic 
                Hindu assumptions'. 
              <p align=LEFT><a href="#33">[33]</a> <a name="e33"></a>'The aim 
                of ISKCON is not to found a new religious sect, but to invoke 
                the living entity's dormant love of God, and thus provide the 
                human society of all faiths with a common platform of clear theistic 
                knowledge and practice. Members of ISKCON may retain their own 
                respective religious faiths, as ISKCON is meant to establish a 
                clear, practical common formulation of the common ideal of all 
                theists, and to defeat the unnecessary dogmatic wranglings that 
                now divide and invalidate the theistic camp. This common ideal 
                of theism is to develop love of God' (68-08-24ROL). 'The conflict 
                is not between East and West; the conflict is between the atheists 
                and the theists. We are preaching Krsna consciousness, not that 
                we are trying to replace something by Indian method to Christian 
                method or Jewish method' (680924IVNEA).
