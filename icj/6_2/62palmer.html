            <p align=LEFT> Yogesvar das offers a richly textured, expertly informed 
              and well-argued vision for a Spiritual Television Network. This 
              is a big idea, embracing as it does a service to a worldwide viewing 
              audience from childhood to old age. The most ambitious and at the 
              same time most attractive feature of the envisioned network is the 
              multi-confessional focus. This ecumenical aspect could have posed 
              a major barrier to the realisation of the idea, except for the author 
              convincingly charts a heart realm of common ground in the form of 
              unifying spiritual themes. He draws an essential distinction between 
              his and other programme approaches that are based on narrow and 
              potentially contentious religiosity, and handles with finesse the 
              usual pejorative attitude toward common denominator programming 
              by raising above common denominational dogmas. The reader wishing 
              to gain a clearer sense of the types of programmes that might be 
              carried by a Spiritual Television Network is encouraged to review 
              the sample of a weekly programme schedule that appears in the original 
              article. 
            <p align=LEFT>The three-fold role for a spirituality centred television 
              network is described by Yogesvar das, based on offering positive 
              messages, viewer comfort and a nurturing-ground for a new community. 
              Many key points in his rational for a Spiritual Network are distilled 
              into the following elaborations upon these three roles. 'Positive 
              messages' by his description consist of 'good news and practical 
              tools for solving material problems with spiritual answers, addressing 
              the issues of today with the in sights of Spiritual wisdom'. 'Viewer 
              comfort' derives from the assurance that the programmes are 'safe, 
              non-sexist, free of racial or religious stereotypes, and reinforcing 
              [of ] positive values and authentic spiritual practices'. 'A new 
              community', reflecting the culture of democracy, 'would demonstrate 
              the ability to walk outside the conventional mechanisms of consumer 
              societysensationalists talk shows, exploitative moviesand develop 
              a different, more satisfying vehicle for informing people'. 
            <p>The author marshals impressive statistics to document the great 
              extent of spiritual interest that suggests a strong audience demand 
              for a Spiritual Television Network. I certainly concur with this 
              argument that television is a capable medium with which to address 
              spirituality, and with his view that a spiritual channel is a much-needed 
              antidote to the all too prevalent images of sex and mayhem. I also 
              believe with him that a niche exists for a Spiritual Television 
              Network in today's environment to technological proliferation. While 
              it may seem to many that today's expanded channel capacity has only 
              ushered in greater quantities of shallow and sensationalist programming, 
              nothing could be more clear than the simultaneous, if not proportionate, 
              increase in serious programs in the areas of the education and the 
              arts. A 100-channel service can offer only so many programmes in 
              areas of news, sports, movies, soaps, music, talk, and game shows 
              before someone figures out that new programme categories will garner 
              greater numbers of viewers than will additional shows into timeworn 
              categories. 
            <p>One can only speculate as to why a global Spiritual Network does 
              not exist. The answer, I suspect, is simply that previously nobody 
              has ever framed the idea of a Spiritual Television Network with 
              Yogesvar Das's fresh, coherent and sensitive vision. His concept 
              departs strikingly from a whole array of all too familiar programmes 
              forms that include religious Hollywood dramas tainted by Hollywood 
              marketing practices, tracts on hotly disputed issues, and narrow 
              denominational sermonising. It can hardly be that the break-through 
              idea for a Spiritual Network came not from the creators of these 
              familiar programme forms, but form someone profoundly steeped in 
              the art of fine story telling, who recognises that the qualities 
              of authenticity, resonance with the human spirit, and universality 
              can be attained by any storytelling medium when the creative intent 
              is to honour these qualities above all else. 
            <p align=LEFT>Yogesvar das has outlined a worthy idea, but as he himself 
              is quick to point out, much additional work will be required to 
              translate the idea into a fully developed and viable plan of action.
