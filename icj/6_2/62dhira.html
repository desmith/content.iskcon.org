            <p align=LEFT>Rochford and Bharata Shrestha das's articles were excellent 
              first steps in understanding the complicated issues in describing 
              the history and determinants of child abuse in ISKCON and the movement's 
              efforts at child protection. While such analyses and accounts can 
              be refined and considered more deeply, this piece focuses on developments 
              in the area during the past several months. 
            <p>Bharata Shrestha das's article brings us to the point of the Mayapur 
              meetings of the Governing Body Commission (GBC) in early 1998, when 
              resolutions were enacted that created and funded the ISKCON Child 
              Protection Office (CPO). Functions of this office are outlined in 
              the Child Protection Task Force Report. The ISKCON Child Protection 
              Task Force, consisting of ISKCON leaders, members of the second 
              generation, as well as devotee professionals including a lawyer 
              and a social worker, was established by the GBC in 1997. This Task 
              Force suggested many proposals for protecting children in ISKCON 
              and dealing with past events, and all of its proposals were accepted 
              as ISKCON policy by the GBC at the 1998 Mayapur meetings. 
            <p>Central to implementing the proposals of the Task Force is the 
              CPO, which began operations on 1, April 1998. The Task Force asked 
              me to serve as Director of the CPO, and I agreed. My experience 
              in the area consists of eight years working in Pennsylvania and 
              Florida in mental health and social service fields such as crisis-intervention, 
              foster care, and medical social work. I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology 
              from Pennsylvania State University, an MSW from Florida State University, 
              and I am currently working toward obtaining a Ph.D. in Social Work 
              at Florida State University. Also, for approximately the past five 
              years I have provided counselling and social services, including 
              child abuse investigations, for the Vaisnava community in Alachua 
              County, Florida, USA. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY> There are three primary functions of the CPO, two 
              of which involve ongoing investigations of past events, and the 
              third deals with arranging systems to prevent recurrence of the 
              same mistakes. The first function is to care for those who suffered 
              mistreatment while they were children in the movement. Second, the 
              CPO is mandated to resolve past and present cases of child abuse. 
              The third function entails helping ISKCON schools, temples and projects 
              to screen volunteers and employees, as well as to implement educational 
              programs on child protection for children, parents, teachers, managers 
              and other members of ISKCON. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY><b>Care for Abuse Victims<br>
              </b>The CPO, in recognition of ISKCON's moral responsibility to 
              its second generation members provides support for survivors of 
              child abuse in the movement. Support is offered by discussing with 
              an individual how they would like to participate in the society, 
              and arranging a service that they might find fulfilling, such as 
              becoming a teacher or participating in other ISKCON projects. A 
              major form of support is funding for educational and vocational 
              endeavours, as well as for therapy. All those who suffered maltreatment 
              in ISKCON while they were children are eligible for grants from 
              the CPO. From talking to those who suffered abuse and their parents, 
              it is clear that this grant program is successful in helping young 
              adults who grew up in ISKCON advance economically and psychologically. 
              The programme is also successful in fostering an appreciation among 
              gurukula veterans, their friends and their parents for the sincerity 
              of ISKCON in acknowledging errors of the past and taking moral responsibility 
              for it. For example, one young member of our society who was helped 
              by the CPO, and is now training to become a doctor, has expressed 
              his appreciation by pledging that he would like to generously support 
              ISKCON monetarily when he becomes a doctor. 
            <p align=LEFT>After six months of working with the CPO, it is evident 
              that while the programme to care for victims of child abuse has 
              made some progress (with some very inspiring results), much more 
              still needs to be done. Although we are continually making efforts 
              to reach them through active programmes many victims have not yet 
              been reached. It is hoped that ISKCON will continue to realise its 
              moral obligation to these persons, and that this realisation will 
              continue to manifest in the form of monetary support<i>.</i> 
            <p align=JUSTIFY><b> Responding to and resolving cases of abuse<br>
              </b>ISKCON has developed a policy of zero tolerance to child abuse 
              in the community, and each allegation is thoroughly investigated 
              by trained members of ISKCON in co-operation with the State authorities. 
              In its concern for the children who experienced abuse, ISKCON has 
              created a system for responding to and resolving child abuse cases. 
              Through this system, the victim's experiences are acknowledged and 
              this acknowledgement plays a large part in the healing process for 
              victims. When the CPO receives allegations of child abuse, the process 
              of investigation begins. Results of the investigation are given 
              to an adjudicative panel. On this panel are child protection judges 
              who are veteran members of ISKCON and have received training in 
              the basic principles of recognising child abuse. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>This training consists of an intensive four-day seminar 
              that includes material on types of abuse, typologies of abusers, 
              investigative procedures, confidentiality, and dealing with personal 
              biases. In July 1998, a child protection judges training was held 
              in North America, with ten devotees participating in the training. 
              This seminar was conducted by two professional social workers, and 
              included lecture and discussion sessions by an expert in forensic 
              psychology, a paediatrician who specialises in child abuse issues, 
              and a nationally renowned psychologist in the field of counselling 
              for victims of child abuse. We are building upon these efforts by 
              holding training seminars in Europe and India in the near future. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>After receiving an investigative case packet, the 
              panel of three judges determines whether there is validity to any 
              of the allegations (in accord with the Task Force Report, the CPO 
              recognises physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect as forms of 
              child maltreatment). If it is decided that at least one of the allegations 
              is true, then the panel meets with the Director of the CPO and the 
              Case Manager for the investigation to ascertain a rectification 
              plan and sentence for the perpetrator The first and foremost consideration 
              of this plan is the safety of the children. This plan also considers 
              the following factors such as personal and institutional moral obligations, 
              the message we want to send out about child protection, punishment 
              and, considering the degree of the offence the possible reform of 
              the perpetrator. Restrictions are in proportion to the offence, 
              and can go as far as complete excommunication from the Society. 
            <p>It should be noted that the investigative and adjudicative procedures 
              of the CPO are not a replacement for the functions of State authorities. 
              The CPO merely determines the relationship of an alleged perpetrator 
              with ISKCON. All temples, schools and projects are directed and 
              assisted by the CPO to learn the laws of their locality regarding 
              child abuse and mandated reporting of child abuse, and to scrupulously 
              follow those laws. In addition to the action of the local government 
              agency, the CPO will determine the future degree of association 
              and role a confirmed child abuser can have in ISKCON, if any. ISKCON 
              law requires that temples and schools immediately contact the appropriate 
              police and government social services agencies when there is a suspicion 
              of child abuse. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Das (1998), in footnote fourteen, mentions several 
              aspects of the case resolution process, as described in the Task 
              Force Report, that some devotees feel are inadequately addressed. 
              These issues, as well as other elements of the Task Force Report, 
              are being addressed, and some adjustments to the Report have already 
              been made. The Report, similar to the body of working policy for 
              a State Department, is constantly under review based on practical 
              consideration that arise as the office confronts new situations. 
              Analysis of policies under consideration is beyond the scope of 
              this paper, whose primary purpose is to provide a general overview 
              of the functions and activities of the office. 
            <p><b>Systems for Prevention<br>
              </b>The CPO works with ISKCON educational authorities and regional 
              and local management bodies to organise child protection screening 
              and education programs throughout ISKCON. Letters have been sent 
              to schools and temples throughout the world that explain basic principles 
              for screening volunteers and employees, and plans for worldwide 
              implementation of these principles are being developed. The education 
              ministry is working on a team and criteria for on-site inspections 
              and certification, or possibly de-certifications of ISKCON schools. 
              Included in the items for inspection and certification will be standards 
              for on-going abuse prevention training for students and a functioning 
              and trained Child Protection Team. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>An additional function of the CPO is to assist temples 
              and schools to organise Child Protection Teams. These teams provide 
              information on child protection issues, and hear concerns, in accord 
              with principles of confidentiality, from community members, including 
              children, about child abuse matters. Further, Child Protection Teams 
              serve as a liaison between the devotee community and governmental 
              law enforcement and social service authorities. Early in 1998, in 
              an ISKCON community in North America, a child abuse case surfaced. 
              After notifying State departments of law and social services, the 
              local ISKCON Child Protection Team assisted State workers with the 
              investigation. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Law officers and Child Protective Investigators commended 
              the devotees for helping with elements of the investigation that 
              otherwise could not have been thoroughly explored. Specifically, 
              State workers acknowledged that intimate knowledge of the devotee 
              community and the religious culture of the alleged perpetrator and 
              victims enabled devotees on the Child Protection Team to access 
              information that would not otherwise be possible to obtain. 
            <p

 align=JUSTIFY>Even if systems for child protection, education and screening are 
              developed, it is likely that monitoring and evaluation of these 
              programs will be problematic. ISKCON temples, schools and projects 
              exist in all corners of the globe. The CPO is based in Alachua, 
              Florida, and is staffed by a director and one secretary. Ultimately, 
              as outlined in the Task Force Report, regional offices will need 
              to be set up for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of local 
              programs. Already many devotees around the world are helping with 
              the various functions of the CPO. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>A list of ISKCON members and friends with experience 
              in mental health and social service fields has been compiled by 
              the CPO as a reference for temples and schools; this will be useful 
              for reference when dealing with victims of abuse and also in assisting 
              investigations. More generally, the CPO serves as a resource, guidance 
              and information centre on child protection issues for devotees around 
              the world. ISKCON members, from both temples as well as those living 
              outside temples, call for advice on handling a particular situation, 
              or request literature for their information. Another function of 
              the CPO is to compile and distribute, as appropriate concerning 
              legal and ethical considerations, a list of abusers and alleged 
              abusers to all ISKCON communities to ensure that repeat abuse does 
              not occur. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>As an institution, we now have a much better understanding of 
              the depth of the problem and must make every effort to protect our 
              children. I have spoken with many people in diverse life situations 
              including therapists of child abusers, child psychologists, second 
              generation members of ISKCON, parents of victims, sannyasis (the 
              renounced order) and priests from other religious traditions, and 
              all are impressed that ISKCON has set up an office specifically 
              dealing with child protection. Child abuse is an ongoing issue in 
              every modern institution and we, as a Society must never think we 
              are immune from it. We must constantly review our efforts to ensure 
              that our social institutions continue to adapt in ways that will 
              increase our children's safety. For a substantial resolution of 
              the problem, this direction needs to become a fixture in ISKCON's 
              institutional policy.
