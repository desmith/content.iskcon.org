            <p align=LEFT><i>If the truth is to be told, it is about everyone: 
              men, women and children in our society who require recognition, 
              honour and respect with sufficient opportunities for devotional 
              service, free from impositions of culture, race or gender. It's 
              about opening a solid, recognisable platform of services in all 
              areas of equal proportion and recognising, identifying, correcting 
              and preventing areas of mistreatment against any devotee in ISKCON 
              by any other ISKCON member.</i> <br>
              Malati devi dasi at the Mayapur Meeting of the Governing Body Commission 
              in 1998. 
            <p>The Women's Ministry of ISKCON has sponsored two conferences in 
              the last four months where members of ISKCON met to discuss the 
              position of women in ISKCON and the contributions which women can 
              make in improving our society. Following on the heels of the historic 
              First Annual Vaisnavis in ISKCON conference in Los Angeles last 
              December, the conferences in Radhadesh (Belgium) in June and Alachua 
              (USA) in September 1998 sought to deepen and extend the examination 
              of issues which affect women. In addition to analysing institutional 
              structures that challenge the participation of women in ISKCON, 
              participants at both conferences discussed the extent to which the 
              treatment of ISKCON's women has affected our movement as a whole. 
            <p><b>The European Conference<br>
              </b> The first European conference of the Women's Ministry took 
              place at Radhadesh. 
            <p>The conference was organised by Jyotirmayi devi dasi and Hari devi 
              dasi, working in conjunction with Sudharma devi dasi. Over fifty 
              women and men gathered for the conference which opened with presentations 
              by Jyotirmayi devi dasi and Radha devi dasi summarising the work 
              of the International Women's Ministry, the Los Angeles Conference, 
              and the response of the GBC to the Ministry's work. The conference 
              attendees were inspired to learn of Malati devi dasi's appointment 
              to the GBC and the support she received from many of the GBC members. 
              Other presentations included Gaurangi devi dasi on 'ISKCON Language 
              and Women', Radha devi dasi's paper titled 'Participation, Protection 
              and Patriarchy: Roles for Women in ISKCON', and a panel discussion 
              on 'The Impact of the Women's Situation in ISKCON on Preaching'. 
              One of the conference's most moving moments was a testimonial by 
              second generation devotee, Chakrini devi dasi, who used her personal 
              experiences to explain some of the ways in which our society has 
              failed women. Describing her childhood as a time when her mother 
              was pressured to neglect her, Chakrini noted that she and her friends 
              'felt, as we grew up, that the role of women was very much frowned 
              upon. We were told that it was just our bad karma to be women'. 
              Her maturity and insight were evident when she concluded that ISKCON 
              needs 'mothers who are happy and confident in their capabilities 
              as women and who therefore pass on those feelings to their children, 
              because those children will grow up to be the parents of the future'. 
            <p>The balance of the conference was spent in lively and thoughtful 
              discussions between the participants on the roles which women can 
              and should undertake in ISKCON as well as the importance of their 
              contributions in helping the larger society to overcome the social 
              difficulties which currently trouble our organisation. The conclusion 
              of the participants was that ISKCON's women and men must co-operate, 
              not compete with each other, in an atmosphere of equal spiritual 
              rights to devotional service and spiritual advancement. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY><b>The North American Conference<br>
              </b>The Second Annual North American Women's Ministry conference 
              in Alachua was an ambitious undertaking which included three days 
              of workshops on a wide range of topics, a one day retreat at a local 
              cold spring spa, and a two day formal conference. Over a hundred 
              devotees participated in some portion of the six-day event. 
            <p>The workshops that opened the conference were impressive in their 
              range and depth. The twenty-eight classes, all presented by Vaisnavis, 
              covered topics ranging from child rearing, marriage, public speaking, 
              leading kirtan (sung prayers), traditional Vedic roles and journal 
              writing, to building self esteem, recovering from mistreatment, 
              organising events and running a temple kitchen. One of the most 
              enthusiastically received workshops was Arcana Siddhi and Mahandrani's 
              presentation entitled 'From Victim to Victor' which focused on healing 
              from past experiences of mistreatment. The wealth of knowledge displayed 
              by the women present was an overwhelming testament to the talent 
              and enthusiasm which women bring to the service of Lord Krishna, 
              and a persuasive argument for the continuing expansion of service 
              opportunities for women. 
            <p>One of the highlights of the women's retreat day was the panel 
              presentation on Srila Prabhupada's pastimes. Laxmimoni devi dasi, 
              Hari Puja devi dasi, Kusa devi dasi, Vishaka devi dasi, Jayasri 
              devi dasi, Malati devi dasi and many others shared their first-hand 
              experiences with Srila Prabhupada. In the process, they inadvertently 
              reminded us all over and over again, how wonderfully and fully Srila 
              Prabhupada engaged women in service, never limiting them by stereotyped 
              gender roles. 
            <p align=LEFT>The two-day formal conference included presentations 
              by a number of academics, senior leaders of ISKCON, second generation 
              devotees and women who are making a difference in our society today. 
              H. H. Bhakti Tirtha Swami opened the conference with a presentation 
              entitled Putting the Heart Back Into<i> ISKCON</i>. This presentation 
              highlighted how the participation of women at higher levels can 
              help our movement to become more in touch with the needs and concerns 
              of our members. H. H. Hridayananda Swami described how his view 
              of women changed as ISKCON developed, highlighting the transformation 
              which others have previously noted from a family oriented society 
              in which women were accepted, to a more repressive form which devalued 
              women at a later point. 
            <p align=LEFT>Vishaka devi dasi spoke on the topic of femininity, 
              presenting scriptural sources and concluding that strength, service 
              and public roles are not inconsistent with <i>sastric </i>injunctions 
              on the place and treatment of women. Sudharma devi dasi, Rukmini 
              devi dasi, Pranada devi dasi, Vraja Lila devi dasi, and Madhumati 
              devi dasi used their personal experiences as devotees to reflect 
              and comment on the ways in which women have overcome institutional 
              barriers in order to serve and advance in ISKCON. 
            <p align=JUSTIFY>Sociologist Professor Burke Rochford, spoke on the 
              mobilisation of women in ISKCON, noting that his research showed 
              widespread support for more equal roles between men and women amongst 
              ISKCON's membership. Professor Vasuda Narayana, an expert on Vaisnava 
              devotional poetry, shared her research and her personal experience 
              as a woman raised in a Vaisnava culture. She described strong female 
              role models within the Vaisnava tradition. 
            <p align=LEFT>The conference ended with a presentation by Radha devi 
              dasi that proposed the adoption of a Bill of Rights for ISKCON. 
              Noting the existence of psychological and sociological causes for 
              oppression of women in the larger society outside of ISKCON, Radha 
              devi dasi argued that ISKCON's development institutionalised some 
              oppressive behaviour. This, she argued, was achieved by labelling 
              similar types of material discrimination, as experienced in everyday 
              society, as 'spiritual' practice. Her presentation concluded with 
              a description of various types of human rights that ISKCON might 
              adopt in seeking to improve the treatment of devotees. While the 
              discussion of women's roles in ISKCON continues, the conferences 
              sponsored by the Women's Ministry leave no doubt that women are 
              making a profound and meaningful contribution to our movement. As 
              H. H. Hridayananda Swami pointed out in his presentation at the 
              women's conference in Los Angeles last December, the eloquence, 
              intelligence and spiritual consciousness shown by the women who 
              participate in these conferences is a loud and persuasive cry that 
              ISKCON open its doors wide to give Vaisnavis unlimited access to 
              devotional service at all levels.
