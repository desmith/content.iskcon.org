            <p align=LEFT>Klostermaier has provided a useful summary of some of 
              the main tenets of a version of ancient history which is on the 
              ascendancy amongst Indian historians and archaeologists. Indeed, 
              the basic idea of indigenous version of ancient history, which is 
              on the ascendancy amongst Indian Indo-Aryan origins (or at least 
              openness to reconsidering the Aryan Migration thesis), is rapidly 
              becoming the dominant, but by no means uncontested point of view 
              amongst specialists in India. It has also recently been receiving 
              considerable attention in Western Indological circles. It is, however, 
              only one point of view. In fairness to those defending the status 
              quo of Indo-Aryan migrations (few speak of invasions anymore and 
              modern scholarship has long since moved beyond the biblical or colonial 
              exigencies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) the matter 
              is far more complex than many Indigenous Aryanists appear to acknowledge. 
              Most representations of the Indigenous point of view are, at best, 
              highly selective in their appropriation of the available and relevant 
              data and, at worst, completely neglectful or dismissive of the fundamental 
              and essential infrastructure of the problem. 
            <p align=LEFT>The first glaring lacuna in many Indigenous Aryan publications 
              is the almost complete lack of reference to the linguistic evidence. 
              Given that the Indo-Aryans are a linguistic entity and that their 
              existence is entirely a postulate of the linguistic data, such neglect 
              is not likely to be seen as indicative of thorough or detached scholarship. 
              Few Indigenous Aryanists seem to be even aware of the implications 
              (or even the existence) of such data as linguistic substrata, linguistic 
              palaeontology, dialectical geography, and loan words (amongst a 
              host of other things), all foundational to the theory of external 
              Aryan origins. 
            <p align=LEFT>Even from within the context of the evidence that the 
              Indigenous School does addressnotably the archaeological, philological 
              and astronomical dataalternative points of view recalcitrant to 
              the Indigenous position deserve at least some token acknowledgement. 
              Scanning the list of items Klostermaier offers for consideration, 
              we can grant that the Mitanni evidence, for example, is not incompatible 
              with an indigenous position, but neither does it by any means disprove 
              the migrationist theory. The urban references often noted in the 
              Rg are peripheral at best (and completely far-fetched at worst), 
              and it seems only fair to note that whatever meagre evidence of 
              horse bones in Harappan and pre-Harappan sites has been brought 
              forward has been disputed by authorities in the field. The layout 
              of the fire altars at Kalibhangan does not seem to correlate with 
              the prescriptions of the Srauta Sutras and so assigning them a ritual 
              function is highly questionable. Moreover, while the Sarasvati may 
              have been drying up by 1900 BCE, I am not aware of any evidence 
              demonstrating that it had completely dried up by then. And as for 
              the correlation of the Indus script with Brahmi, this is hardly 
              a fait accompli, but only accepted by a small group of scholars 
              even from within the Indigenous camp. The list goes on. 
            <p align=LEFT>All this is not to say that the evidence supporting 
              the theory of Aryan migrations is not without problems. Far from 
              it: my own research concludes that the debate (where it is conducted 
              in a rigorous fashion) is a legitimate one and that the Indigenous 
              position has its merits. The whole theory of Aryan migrations does 
              indeed need to be subject to intense scrutiny. But this will only 
              be fruitful when it is done by examining all the evidence and all 
              rational points of view in a detached and thorough fashion. Selective 
              or one-sided interpretations of the evidence are ultimately detrimental 
              to such reconsiderations.&nbsp; As a result much Indigenous Aryanist 
              scholarship is understandably viewed with suspicion, or dismissed 
              as the product of predetermined conviction rather than objective 
              scholarship. 
            <p align=LEFT>ISKCON devotees, of course, are likely to greet the 
              new version of events with enthusiasm. But since some of them are 
              proving to be sincere about open-minded dialogue and interaction 
              with the academic community, they would be better served by being 
              exposed to the full spectrum of data and the plethora of opinions 
              in the complex matter of Indo-Aryan origins. The Indigenous Aryan 
              position certainly merits consideration, but not at the expense 
              of honest scholarship.
