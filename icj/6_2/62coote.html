            <p align=LEFT>I cannot fail first to pay tribute to the honest frankness 

              and dispassionate judgement of E. Burke Rochford and Bhararata Srestha 

              das in their articles. 'Dispassionate' does not, of course, denote 

              an attitude of cool standing back and self-distancing from the realities 

              of such a painful subject. Rather it signals the endeavour of a 

              religious believer or sympathiser to be committed to practical and 

              effective action for change, instead of being paralysed by panic 

              and despair, or provoked into ill-considered action by rage or defensiveness. 

            <p align=LEFT>I recognise points of convergence with the experience 

              of the Roman Catholic community in Britain in the sociological analysis 

              of the situation by E. Burke Rochford, but I recognise differences 

              also. There can be a variety of causal factors in child abuse. Obviously, 

              I am speaking from a social context limited by my experience in 

              Britain, which is significantly different from North America, to 

              say nothing of India. 

            <p align=LEFT>The association of religion with child abuse, and of 

              religious ideas with emotional abuse, is possibly more plausible 

              in the context of the United States. If a fundamentalist approach 

              to scripture and a pessimistic interpretation of Original Sin is 

              still encouraged with strong religious practice, one can see the 

              links. British Catholics are more surrounded and influenced by secular 

              agnosticism, and secular ideas of child rearing. (Only the wealthy 

              minority was, until recently, able to pay elite private schools 

              to beat their children for misbehaviour; these private schools were, 

              with eccentric anachronism, called 'public schools'.)

            <p align=LEFT>Totally foreign to the Catholic tradition is the idea 

              that marriage and family might be a symbol of spiritual failure, 

              and that children's education could become of secondary importance 

              to the community's main mission. On the contrary, building schools 

              and educating children received greater priority in resources allocation 

              in comparison to even church building. Parents were not excluded 

              from contact with the network of day schools. Religious orders engaged 

              with care of children and education as their primary <i>raison d'être</i>. 

              Yet in these far from marginalised institutions (schools and families) 

              abuse <i>did</i> occur.

            <p align=LEFT>Nevertheless, there was a restricted group of children, 

              who by definition were deprived of parents or family lifethose 'in 

              care', either as orphans, or by secular court order, or those handed 

              over by unmarried girls unintentionally pregnant. Worse still for 

              those children who were 'exported' to commonwealth countries with 

              inter-governmental approval to enjoy a supposedly 'better and healthier 

              life' than was available to them in tired, cold, hungry, post-war 

              Britain. These probably suffered the worst abuse, emotional, physical 

              and sexual. The abusers were priests, religious sisters and lay 

              staff. The situations were those of isolation from society and living 

              in 'total' institutions. The Utting Report<a href="#e1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 

              has shown that even today, living away from home is an indicator 

              of risk be it in religious or secular society. Wherever there are 

              children living away from home, in a situation of particular dependency 

              and subordination to authority, there is a magnet for child abusers. 

              Without efficient management and standards that can be, and <i>are 

              </i>checked, abuse is likely. 

            <p align=LEFT> Opportunity is of course widely available to trusted 

              religious guidesthe family circle is open to them, they are above 

              criticism, welcome and their attention and kindness to children 

              is particularly valued. (Only doctors could be more greatly trusted, 

              but most children are not perpetually ill.) The non-religious abuser 

              has to find his way into the family, perhaps via cohabitation with 

              a vulnerable woman to obtain access to children. In contrast the 

              power of the religious guide lies in his or her ability to persuade 

              children that somehow 'this is all right', and to deflect suspicion 

              by status. 

            <p align=LEFT>For these reasons the response to child abuse cannot 

              be limited to ensuring that new cases are properly handled-though 

              this is important as an immediate response by an institution. Here, 

              the context of secular law and public authority is exceptionally 

              important. If the welfare of children is paramount, and if there 

              are adequate public services, then co-operation and liaison with 

              the State authorities are the guiding principles, not leaping into 

              inexpert investigation by interested parties. It is natural, as 

              Bharata Srestha das outlined, that ISKCON Resolutions 90119 should 

              precede 98305, but it would be strongly advisable that attention 

              to the needs of victims and to prevention should become the focus. 

            <p>It is likely that there will always be some cases of abuse (this 

              is a sad fact of any organisation, be it religious or secular), 

              and there will be abuse that is never discovered. The most effective 

              action that an organisation can take is to reduce risks and opportunities 

              by preventive policies. Perhaps most important is the adoption of 

              'professional' or 'acceptable' standards of conduct for all those 

              that work with children whether paid or volunteers. This limits 

              opportunities of access to children. It provides a discernible matter 

              for detecting and prosecuting perpetrators, and finally defends 

              people from the risk of false accusations. Setting standards requires 

              resources at a local level or a unit of management or authority 

              that will enable teams to work. These teams will introduce, advise 

              on, modify and monitor these standards by their observation. They 

              should be answerable to the local religious authority (the bishop 

              for Catholics) and enjoy unequivocal support from that quarter. 

              They should be trusted with full information and should ensure that 

              such information is comprehensive and without breaks in continuity. 

            <p align=LEFT> The last problem to be addressed (and this does not 

              necessarily come after the other tasks have been completed) is what 

              to do with offenders. A number of questions spring to mind: is the 

              religious community right to conclude that offenders must, without 

              exception, be expelled? Does that make the world safer for children? 

              One is aware of the danger of bogus repentance by an offender, and 

              the danger of an abuser's utilisation of religious status to obtain 

              access. Our experience is that incarceration of an offender provides 

              both a safe period and a breathing space for the institution to 

              assess how to respond. But what next? Do you throw a time bomb out 

              into society, or do you try to strike a bargain: supervised life 

              within the religious community, subject to strict conditions, regular 

              risk assessment and the knowledge of those who need to know? Like 

              many other problems surrounding child abuse, there probably is not 

              one right answer-we have to cope with 'doing the best we can'.
