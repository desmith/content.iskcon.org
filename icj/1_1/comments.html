               <h1><b>COMents</b></h1>
            <p class="abstract">This feature brings us relevant comment and advice from our 
              communications conference in 'Com', the North European electronic 
              mail system.</p>
            <p>The first letter was received only two days before the tragic 'end' 
              of the Waco siege.  The other letters came after the fateful 19 
              April.</p>
            <p>Text: 252291<br />
              Receiver: ICE (ISKCON Communications Europe)<br />
              Subject: Waco<br />
              San Diego, California, USA<br />
    13 April 1993</p>
            <p>Waco is not 'over'. Some naively thought it would end at Easter.   
              I've been following most ICE comments on it since they began. In 
              my judgement there's some important lessons to learn from this continuing 
              incident.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We tend to get more conscientious about communications when 
                there's negative media or 'media crises'.</li>
              <li>We still have a lot to learn about media relations.</li>
              <li>For the most part, we still do not have a good reputation in 
                the minds of the majority of people, either in Europe or USA, 
                although there are some exceptions.</li>
              <li>Changing ISKCON's reputation to a positive one will require 
                a lot of hard work, enthusiasm, confidence, patience and commitment.</li>
              <li>We <i>must</i> change our reputation. When we're proactive in 
                the right way for a long enough there will not need to 'respond' 
                to 'lump-ins', because they won't happen.</li>
              <li>We're almost certain to have more negative media fall-out before 
                the situation in Waco is resolved.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The greatest eye-opener for me was how vulnerable we still are 
              in our present state of having such a debilitated reputation. Although 
              events of the magnitude of Jonestown and Waco may only happen once 
              in a decade, they will occur again and again.  Religious fanatics 
              will commit atrocities and we'll be lumped in with them, because 
              our most active enemies will exploit the situation.</p>
            <p>I think that for the most part we have been handling the present 
              Waco situation well. Also, it has been obvious throughout this drama 
              that ISKCON's reputation is far better in some sectors than in others. 
              The greatest lesson for me was that had we developed our reputation 
              properly according to tested methods of communication, especially 
              media relations, we simply would not have been identified with this 
              tragedy which had nothing whatever to do with us.</p>
            <h3>Case in point </h3>
            <p>(As to how effective proactive communications and a good reputation 
              can be):<br />
    Dateline: Detroit<i> (USA)     </i></p>
            <p>A local TV reporter phones the temple. She talks with Bhusaya prabhu, 
              saying she wants to 'do a story' on ISKCON, and would be relating 
              it to the Waco story. Bhusaya politely informs her that our movement 
              was doing a lot of charitable work in the community, had a large 
              congregation (including many ethnic Hindus), had done a lot of community 
              work, and was an ancient and major faith. He also politely says 
              that he didn't think ISKCON had any part to play in a story about 
              Waco. He suggests that she discuss her idea with her colleagues 
              and get back to him.</p>
            <p>About four hours later she phones him and starts the conversation 
              by saying, 'Mr Dickmeyer, I am very sorry. I owe you an apology.' 
              She then goes on to say that she didn't know ISKCON was actually 
              a real religion with a big following and all the good work it was 
              doing in Detroit. Her colleagues, she says, fully supported what 
              Bhusaya couldn't fully convince her of in their earlier conversation. 
              She ends by saying that she had decided not to include ISKCON in 
              her story on Waco.</p>
            <p>In Detroit where ISKCON does have an unusually good reputation, 
              it has become traditional wisdom <i>not</i> to include the Hare 
              Krsnas in the Waco story.  This is the kind of appreciation for 
              Srila Prabhupada's movement we would like to see ISKCON obtain all 
              over the world.  When the public sees ISKCON as improving the quality 
              of life, their attitudes and behaviour towards us will change.</p>
            <p>I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you about the 'universal 
              mission statement' crafted by IC and some communications professionals, 
              which I'm convinced can be subtly woven into all our preaching:</p>
            <p>The Hare Krsna Movement benefits the individual and society by 
              offering practical solutions to today's material and spiritual problems. 
              These problems include (<i>choose as appropriate</i>):</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Ethnic, racial and cultural conflict</li>
              <li>First Amendment (USA only) and religious freedom</li>
              <li>Hunger</li>
              <li>Human and animal rights (consistent life policy)</li>
              <li>Health, diet, and disease</li>
              <li>Environmental problems</li>
              <li>Drugs and alcohol</li>
              <li>Crime</li>
              <li>Economic imbalance</li>
              <li>Family welfare</li>
              <li>Ethics and morality</li>
              <li>Stress and anxiety</li>
              <li>Education</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Obviously we have to be accepted, but we need to go beyond acceptance 
              and be known as a movement that has spiritual perspectives on all 
              the issues of the day and can even help solve some of the major 
              problems of the world. In short, ISKCON benefits society, and its 
              volunteers work tirelessly toward that end.  The activities Saunaka 
              Rsi prabhu is helping plan and organise are essential to this process.</p>
            <p>I thought that the comments on television posture by Dyanakunda, 
              Premarnava, et al, were interesting and, for the most part, on the 
              mark. One disputed point was sitting posture. Pundits in the field, 
              if we can rightly call them that, have reached a consensus that 
              <i>most</i> interviewees should sit erect so as to look alert and 
              gesture with their hands, and even exaggerate facial expressions 
              so as to engage viewers. For already known persons, however, such 
              as celebrities or dignitaries, the laid-back, open-jacket, leaning-back 
              posture is sometimes more appropriate because these people will 
              already have the audience's attention by their reputation and most 
              of them are seasoned veterans at public speaking -actors or actresses. 
              They know how to attract attention and get their messages across 
              in many subtle ways that average people cannot command.</p>
            <p>Many media relations and communications techniques are systematic 
              and have been tested for years. <i>You can learn them</i>. So why 
              try to reinvent the wheel?</p>
            <p>In this connection I'd like to invite any of you who are interested 
              to attend this year's Kartika IC course 'communications workshops', 
              in which we will include 'on camera' training with Narasimhananda 
              of ITV. The course will also include practical photography with 
              photography expert Kurma Rupa, a writing course with Drutakarma, 
              'Food for Life' with Priyavrata, and more .</p>
            <p>Saunaka Rsi and Visnu Murti will also provide you with tapes of 
              the IC presentation on the media made by Anuttama Dasa together 
              with other IC materials, as well as other presentations made at 
              the various seminars in Radhadesh.</p>
            <p>Getting back to Waco, most of us at ICE realised that the reactions 
              were not all bad, as evidenced by some decent coverage in Sweden 
              and England. <i>Newsweek</i> mentioned 'Krsna  consciousness' in 
              the lead paragraph on its breaking story on Waco on 15 March, lumping 
              us in with witches, crazies, etc. - <i>very</i> bad. However, in 
              its 5 April edition, the same magazine printed what amounted to 
              an apology on the letters page. In a prominent box at the top of 
              page 12 under the headline, 'Mail Call: What's a Cult?', the editors 
              wrote, 'A defender of Krsna consciousness, meanwhile, faulted us 
              for associating a tradition that espouses vegetarianism, chastity 
              and charity, with the likes of witches' covens.' Of course it would 
              have been far better had ISKCON had not been mentioned at all in 
              the breaking story. But this back-peddling is an indication that 
              the media as whole - and this appears to be a general phenomenon 
              worldwide - have not drawn battle lines against us. In general, 
              one might say, they're abysmally ignorant about us, even, sad to 
              say, in India.</p>
            <p>I noticed - I think in a comment by Sukrita prabhu - mention of 
              the possibility that the FBI might have become a bit 'trigger happy', 
              having been inflamed by the anti-cult movement which left no stone 
              unturned to exploit the situation to their advantage. This may well 
              be true, but also it may not be. We'll probably never know. We can 
              only speculate. So I agree with the comment that it would be dangerous 
              to blame the anti-cult movement for this incident without any clear-cut, 
              factual knowledge. Even then, it might be wholly inadvisable to 
              take such a tact.</p>
            <p>Until we have achieved at least a modicum of respect and <i>sraddha</i> 
              from the general public, the remainder of the Waco saga and other 
              cult incidents that might arise in future, could again drag us into 
              murky media waters. Nonetheless those of us who are trained, expert, 
              or inspired enough, can practise the art of turning such prominence 
              into an opportunity to preach and spread Krsna consciousness.  But 
              state-of-the-art communication is to build a reputation and <i>sraddha</i> 
              to a point where the media won't even think about us when these 
              things happen. Then we can utilise the time to get on with the proactive 
              work of getting our messages across.</p>
            <p>We still have a lot to do and a long way to go.</p>

            <h3>Update on Waco</h3>
            
            <p>Text: 254206<br />
              Receiver: ICE<br />
              Subject: Waco<br />
              San Diego, California, USA<br />
    19 April 1993</p>
            <p>The following message was faxed to most North American temples 
              at approximately 22:00 hours California time, 19 April, 1993.  They 
              also received a copy of my last Com message on <i>Free Forum</i>.  
              Please feel free to use this information in the way you see fit.  
              About eighty people have died in the Waco debacle, so the anti-cult 
              movement will have a heyday.  It will go on for at least several 
              more days with high intensity media coverage.  So stay closely tuned, 
              as we may well be lumped in.</p>
            <p>Your servant,<br />
    Mukunda Goswami</p>
            <h4>Urgent message concerning Waco mass suicide<br />
    Attention all temple presidents and communication directors</h4>
            <p>The tragic mass suicide/deaths in Waco, Texas Monday, 19 April, 
              1993 will again draw local, national and international media attention 
              on the issue of cults, religious violence, the legitimacy and/or 
              dangerousness of non-mainstream religions, etc.</p>
            <p>Up-to-date information at the time of this being put on Com is 
              that seventy-eight members of David Koresh's spin-off group of the 
              Davidians (itself a spin-off of the Seventh Day Adventist Christian 
              group) are dead in what seems to be a mass suicide in Waco, Texas, 
              USA.</p>
            <p>An official statement from ISKCON was distributed by professional 
              wire services to hundreds of media outlets from our national offices 
              in Denver and San Diego.  A copy of that statement was put on Com 
              earlier.</p>
            <p>Please note: you may be contacted by the media for a statement 
              about Waco.  You should be familiar with the situation and our response.</p>
            <p>It is advised that you monitor your local and national media, especially 
              TV and newspapers, for a few days in case we need to respond to 
              their lumping us in.</p>
            <p>We hope that the whole unfortunate incident will blow over and 
              no-one will try to link the Hare Krsnas with this crazy and violent 
              Christian group.  But that is unlikely.  Therefore, we must be prepared 
              in case problems develop.</p>
            <p>Our professional communication consultants, Mukunda Maharaja and 
              myself, have established the following four points as critical elements 
              in any response you make to the media.  Please remember spontaneity 
              does not work in media work.  A good communicator knows what he/she 
              want to say before they meet the press.</p>
            <p>1.  This very sad incident is not the result of a religious problem.  
              This is a social problem.  Everywhere there is violence.</p>
            <p>It's in the schools, on the streets, in the police departments 
              (the continuing Rodney King incident in the US, for instance), in 
              the family, everywhere.  Just because the Waco people say they were 
              religious doesn't mean this is a religious problem. </p>
            <p>2.  The Hare Krsna religion is a five thousand year old monotheistic 
              faith within the broader Hindu tradition.  What was done by this 
              obscure deviant Christian group has no bearing whatsoever on our 
              ancient religion.  On the contrary, the Hare Krsna religion is making 
              significant contributions towards improving the quality of life 
              or millions of people.</p>
            <p>For example, our Food for Life programme has fed twenty million 
              meals to needy and homeless people all over the world including 
              Moscow, and Sarajevo. The families of our large congregation, fifty 
              million of which are Asian Indian worldwide, are spiritually benefited 
              by our temples. We teach people to give up alcohol and drugs, major 
              sources of social violence and strife, and to live simple, God-centred 
              lives.</p>
            <p>No-one should falsely inflame bigotry and prejudice against legitimate 
              and innocent ethnic and religious minorities that have no connection 
              whatsoever with the Waco group as a result of this sad situation.</p>
            <p>You can draw additional ideas from our media statement as well.</p>
            <p>Remember, we do not want to approach the media about this.  Best 
              if the whole sordid affair just goes away.  But if they call us 
              we must respond.  Remember, if they do call, 'no comment' is perceived 
              as 'guilty as charged'.</p>
            <p>If there is some local negative coverage, it is best to contact 
              your national or regional Communications Director for advice on 
              how to proceed.</p>
            <p>These things are delicate to deal with.  In many situations once 
              a negative story is run, it's best not to respond at all because 
              it often just reaffirms the negative image. Sometimes, however, 
              depending on the local situation, different means may be taken.</p>
            <p>Finally, Mukunda Maharaja and myself are monitoring the situation 
              and are available to assist you at any time.  For urgent events

            <h3>Hare Krsna perspective on Waco</h3>
            <p>Dear ***</p>
            <p>As the sad and harrowing final chapter of the Waco, Texas ordeal 
              unfolds, we urgently request you, in the rush to provide coverage, 
              please avoid stirring up ethnic and religious bigotry and hatred 
              against legitimate religious traditions in the United States.</p>
            <p>The Hare Krsna religion and its congregation - fifty per cent of 
              whom are Asian Indian immigrants who have practised our way of worship 
              for generations in India - do not deserve to be mentioned in the 
              same story or shown in the same video file with a deviant Christian 
              sect which has caused violent harm to so many.</p>
            <p>Ours is a five thousand year old monotheistic religion within the 
              Hindu tradition.  We are endeavouring to improve the quality of 
              life for millions of people worldwide through programmes like 'Hare 
              Krsna Food for Life' which has fed over twenty million meals to 
              the needy and homeless in cities like Philadelphia. Moscow and Sarajevo.</p>
            <p>Richard C. Dujardin, First Vice President of the Religion Newswriter's 
              Association, stated at last weekend's convention of the Religious 
              Public Relations Council in New York City that the Waco debacle 
              was a vivid example of the media's failure to accurately report 
              religious stories and instead simply 'dust off old files' and throw 
              out unfounded and inaccurate 'cult stories'.  The Hare Krsna movement 
              is not a cult, but an ancient, time-tested religious tradition.</p>
            <p>Children of many different religious and ethnic minorities will 
              go to school tomorrow and face schoolmates whose view of them and 
              their religious heritage will be shaped by the manner in which your 
              organisation covers this news item over the next few days.</p>
            <p>Please stick the facts of the story.  Please don't inflame fear 
              and prejudice against innocent people.  The pain of Waco is sufficient 
              sorrow.</p>
