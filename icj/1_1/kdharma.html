<h2><a href="contributors.html#kd">Krishna Dharma Dasa</a></h2>

<p>One objection to Food for Life frequently encountered from
devoteesand non-devotees alike, is that the programme is simply an
attemptto win public favour. We are not really interested in
helping peoplebut are trying to manipulate public opinion by
performing a highprofile charitable service. For devotees, this
objection is alsorooted in the doubt that, as a spiritual
organisation, ISKCON shouldnot be concerned with mundane welfare
work and, of course, we shouldcertainly not be trying to manipulate
people's minds by doing somethingwe don't really believe in
ourselves. The purpose of this papertherefore, is to answer this
objection and to establish Food forLife as a programme deserving as
much credibility as both <i>hari-nama</i>and book distribution. It
is divided into two sections: the philosophicalbasis of the
programme from Srila Prabhupada's writings, and somepractical
aspects and benefits of Food for Life.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be appropriate to begin with a few words about
the name 'Food for Life'. For devotees, the name should be
synonymous with <i>prasadam</i> distribution. However, the fact
that the perfectly acceptable programme of <i>prasadam</i>
distribution has been given the name 'Food for Life' is perhaps
where the doubts begin. It seems to indicate an attempt to
manipulate opinion and win favour with the public. Well, in a
sense, that's true - we are trying to highlight <i>prasadam</i>
distribution. However, although that has the benefit of winning
public support - and I doubt if anyone will say that this is in
itself a bad thing - there are also other good reasons for it. By
giving it an identity of its own, we make <i>prasadam</i>
distribution into something that can be easily accepted by
everyone. The public may view it as a welfare programme, but does
that matter? As long as we ourselves do not lose sight of what
'Food for Life' actually is, then there should be no problem. If
the public are watching us perform devotional service and they
appreciate that service, for whatever reason, then surely this is
most desirable. In addition, by having a division of ISKCON which
is dedicated to distributing food to the needy, we can open many
doors in society and thus greatly expand <i>prasadam</i>
distribution. Obviously we want everyone to get <i>prasadam</i> and
not just the 'needy'; but we have to start wherever we can and
continue from there - 'In like a needle and go out like a plough'.
In addition, although I do not have access to a computer database
of all Srila Prabhupada's instructions, I have fully researched his
main writings and will therefore support my position with quotes
taken from these, namely <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>,
<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> and <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. I know
that Srila Prabhupada gave many instructions about <i>prasadam</i>
distribution in both his lectures and his conversations.</p>

<p>I would now like to talk about the philosophical basis of 'Food
for Life'. I have divided this into five headings which I will deal
with individually.</p>

<h3>Prasadam distribution is a fundamental strand of
preaching</h3>

<p>This statement will probably not attract much argument, if any
at all. We all know how important it is to distribute
<i>prasadam</i>. Where would the Sunday Feast be without a feast?
Could we contemplate any festival without big <i>prasadam</i>
distribution? Would we ever turn anyone away from our temples
without offering <i>prasadam</i>? Obviously not. Indeed the
<i>Bhagavad-gita</i> states that, 'Any sacrifice performed without
distribution of <i>prasadam</i> is considered to be in the mode of
ignorance.' (Bg 17.13). But is there a need to make <i>prasadam</i>
distribution a separate programme, outside of our normal preaching
at meetings and festivals, etc.? There are several quotes which
appear to support this. For example, in the
<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> we find the following instruction: 'Temple
worship necessarily includes distribution of <i>prasadam</i> . One
should exhibit compassion for ignorant living entities by
distributing <i>prasadam</i>. Distribution of <i>prasadam</i> to
the ignorant masses of people is essential for persons who make
offerings to the Personality of Godhead.' (SB 3.29.24 purp.). This
quote appears in the significant context of instructions on Deity
worship. Lord Kapila has stated that Deity Worship is not pleasing
to Him if it is performed by a person ignorant of His presence in
everyone's heart. In his purport, Srila Prabhupada confirms that
the way to recognise the Lord's presence is the hearts of others is
by giving them <i>prasadam</i>. By the qualification 'ignorant
masses', Prabhupada gives a clear indication that we should be
going out to the people with that <i>prasadam</i>. The preceding
purport also contains the following instruction: 'Distribution of
<i>prasadam</i> . even to the ignorant masses of people and to
animals, gives such living entities the chance for elevation to
Krsna consciousness.' (SB 3.29.23 purp.). The Fourth Canto
similarly states: 'In this age, distribution of <i>prasadam</i> has
replaced distribution of money. No-one has sufficient money to
distribute, but if we distribute Krsna-<i>prasadam</i> as far as
possible, this is more valuable than the distribution of money'.
(SB 4.9.24). This appears in the context of descriptions of the
great sacrifices performed by Dhruva Maharaja. Sacrifices are
complete only after charity has been given and here Srila
Prabhupada instructs that this charity should be <i>prasadam</i>
distribution. Later in the same Canto, we find this statement:
'Somehow or other everyone can manage to perform such a
<i>yajna</i> (<i>sankirtana</i>) and distribute <i>prasadam</i> to
the people in general. That is quite sufficient for this age of
Kali. The Hare Krsna Movement is based on this principle: chant the
Hare Krsna mantra at every moment, both inside and outside of the
temples, and, as far as possible, distribute <i>prasadam</i>. This
process can be accelerated with the help of the state
administrators and those who are producing the country's wealth.
Simply by liberal distribution of <i>prasadam</i> and
<i>sankirtana</i>, the whole world can become peaceful and
prosperous'. (SB 4.12.10). These various instructions indicate the
significance of <i>prasadam</i> distribution as a fundamental
preaching tool. Of course, the ideal situation is also to perform
<i>sankirtana</i> and there are ways that <i>kirtana</i> can be
incorporated into Food for Life. However, even if we cannot engage
these 'ignorant masses' in <i>sankirtana</i>, we can at least give
them <i>prasadam</i>. By the purifying effect of the
<i>prasadam</i>, their inclination to chant the holy name can thus
be awakened.</p>

<h3>Prasadam distribution is our secret weapon</h3>

<p>Srila Prabhupada himself coined this phrase, and there is an
interesting purport in the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> which nicely
illustrates it: 'The Krsna consciousness movement vigorously
approves this practice of preparing food, offering it to the Deity
and distributing it to the general population. This activity should
be extended universally to stop sinful eating habits as well as
other behaviour befitting only demons. A demoniac civilisation will
never bring peace within the world. Since eating is the first
necessity in human society, those engaged in solving the problems
of preparing and distributing food should take lessons from
Madhavendra Puri and execute the <i>Annakuta</i> ceremony. When the
people take to eating only <i>prasadam</i> offered to the Deity all
demons will be turned into Vaishnavas.' Prabhupada goes on to say
that due to this there will be Krsna conscious leadership and thus
peace in society. (Peace resulting from distribution of
<i>prasadam</i> was also mentioned in the purport quoted above from
the Fourth Canto). If it is presented nicely in an appropriate
manner, hardly anyone will object to taking <i>prasadam</i>. As we
are satisfied that the taking of <i>prasadam</i> is in itself
purification, we do not have to feel the need to overtly preach at
the same time. We can simply hand out <i>prasadam</i> and let that
do the preaching from within. The result in society will be as
Prabhupada describes: there will be no more 'disturbing demons' as
leaders and the threat of wars and oppression will thus recede.
<i>Prasadam</i> is therefore a secret weapon, with the power to
neutralise the enemy without their even knowing how it has
happened.</p>

<h3>Prasadam distribution is giving people Krsna</h3>

<p>Every devotee knows that the remnants of food left by the Lord
are considered non-different from the Lord. By giving people
<i>prasadam</i><i>,</i> therefore, we are actually giving them
Krsna. '<i>Yesam</i> <i>tv anta gatam papam jananam punya
karmanam</i>' (Bg 7.28). In addition, by offering <i>prasadam</i>
to people we are also giving them pious credits on the
transcendental platform; this means, for example, they will be able
to gain some understanding of our books. Thus <i>prasadam</i>
distribution will also enhance the effect of book distribution. In
fact, a point of interest in this regard is the following verse
spoken by Lord Brahma in the Tenth Canto of
<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i><i>,</i> '<i>Athapi</i> <i>te deva</i>
<i>padambujam-dvayam-prasaa</i> <i>lesanugrhita eva hi</i>.' (SB
10.14.29) - unless a person receives the mercy of Krsna,
specifically referred to here as <i>prasadam</i>, he will not be
able to understand knowledge about Krsna (<i>janati</i> <i>tattvam
bhagavan manhimno</i>); even if he studies the Vedas for a very
long time (<i>na</i> <i>canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan</i>). Also
worth mentioning is the case of Narada Muni, who, by once taking
the remnants of food left by great sages, became engaged in
devotional service, '<i>Ucchista-lepan</i> <i>anumodito</i>
<i>dvijaih</i> <i>sakrt sma bhunje tad-apasta-kilbisah.</i>' (SB
1.5.25). This pastime also indicates the importance of ensuring
<i>prasadam</i> is properly offered.</p>

<h3>Prasadam distribution is grhastha dharma</h3>

<p>There is a famous story of a <i>grhastha</i> who asked Srila
Prabhupada about the specific duties of <i>grhastha asrama</i>.
Prabhupada replied that before taking <i>prasadam</i>, the
<i>grhastha</i> should stand on the doorstep and call out for any
hungry man to come and share his food. In fact, Srila Prabhupada
was simply giving a practical definition of the duties of
<i>grhastha-asrama</i> which are given in the <i>sastra</i>. We
find many instructions in this regard; the instruction cited above
is found in the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, <i>Madhya</i> 3.41:
'According to Vedic principles the householder, before taking
lunch, should go outside and shout very loudly to see if there is
anyone without food. In this way he invited people to take
<i>prasadam</i>.' Further in this purport, Prabhupada also
interestingly states, 'Thus (because of the above) the
householder's life is called <i>grhastha-asrama</i>.' As we know,
the essence of the religious duties for householders is charity,
and this takes practical shape in the form of <i>prasadam</i>
distribution. As quoted above (SB 4.9.24), Prabhupada states that
distribution of <i>prasadam</i> replaces the distribution of money
in this age, and also has greater value. In the purport to SB
4.12.10 Srila Prabhupada talks about <i>sankirtana-yajna</i> for
householders, stating that they should, 'distribute <i>prasadam</i>
to the people in general . somehow or other everyone can manage
this.' Regarding to whom p<i>rasadam</i> should be given, the
following are specifically mentioned: 'Dogs, fallen persons and
untouchables including <i>candalas</i> (dog eaters) should all be
maintained with their proper necessities which should be
contributed by the householders.' (SB 7.11.14).</p>

<p>Sometimes Food for Life' is criticised for 'targeting the bums
and destitutes on the street and this is not good because you're
just encouraging them to be bums', but the previous quote
specifically mentions that these people should be maintained by the
<i>grhasthas</i>. In the Seventh Canto there are several statements
regarding the importance of <i>prasadam</i> distribution by
householders. 'Factually, according to the instructions of
<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, every <i>grhastha</i> is a great
communist who provides the means of living for everyone. Whatever a
<i>grhastha</i> may possess, he should equally distribute to all
living entities, without discrimination. The best process is to
distribute <i>prasadam</i>. Whatever money a <i>grhastha</i>
accumulates by the grace of God, he should spend in five
activities. Namely worshipping the Supreme personality of Godhead,
receiving Vaishnavas and saintly persons, distributing
<i>prasadam</i> to the general public and all living entities,
offering <i>prasadam</i> to his own self.' (SB 7.14 introd.).
Perhaps a point worth considering in this regard is that Srila
Prabhupada specifically refers to five kinds of sacrifice. In
traditional <i>varnasrama</i><i>-dharma,</i> this is <i>karma
kanda</i>, not really appropriate for the Vaishnavas. However,
Srila Prabhupada has given us a purely transcendental process which
focuses on offering <i>prasadam</i> to different types of living
beings. In fact, there is no such emphasis on any other kind of
service for <i>grhasthas</i> anywhere in Srila Prabhupada's books.
Clearly he considered this to be very important.</p>

<h3>Prasadam for distribution must be nicely offered</h3>

<p>I wanted to emphasise this point as Srila Prabhupada has some
very specific things to say in this regard. Food for Life
<i>prasadam</i> is often not considered as needing to be such high
quality. After all, beggars can't be choosers, they should all be
grateful for anything at all. However, I feel this attitude is a
little mistaken. For a start, surely any contact a person has with
our movement should be memorable. Taking first-class
<i>prasadam</i> is certainly that, but there are also statements in
our books specifically dealing with this: 'To distribute to all
living entities, the process is that we must first offer
<i>prasadam</i> to the brahmans and the Vaishnavas, for the
demigods are represented by the brahmans'. (Note here how Srila
Prabhupada obviates the offering to the demigods by saying the
brahmans represent the demigods). 'In this way the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who is situated in everyone's heart will be
worshipped. This is the Vedic system of offering <i>prasadam</i>.
Whenever there is a ceremony for distribution of <i>prasadam</i>,
the <i>prasadam</i> is offered first to the brahmans, then to the
children, then to the old men, and then to women, and then to the
animals like dogs and other domestic animals.' So the point here is
that it should be done in a particular way. Certainly that would
fulfil these instructions and also facilitate the distribution of
first-class <i>prasadam</i> endued with great spiritual
potency.</p>

<p>This hopefully establishes something of the philosophical import
of <i>prasadam</i> distribution in our movement. Of course, we can
find many more statements from Srila Prabhupada; I have not quoted
any of his letters, conversations or lectures. However, it is still
obvious that the programme is of paramount importance to our
preaching.</p>

<h3>Stress the spiritual aspect</h3>

<p>We should be very confident about telling people about the
spiritual benefits of <i>prasadam</i>. After all, we are a
spiritual movement and they are obviously going to understand that
we have some kind of spiritual programme, even while giving out
food. As mentioned above, we should first of all make it clear that
<i>prasadam</i> distribution is itself preaching as far as we are
concerned. In other words, it is not just a front to enable us to
get some straight proselytising in as soon as the opportunity
arises; there are no obligations imposed by us on recipients of our
food. We should however, try to explain how <i>prasadam</i> has a
spiritually purifying effect, both on the individual and ultimately
on society itself. For example, we can point out that shortages and
scarcity in society are ultimately caused by man's greed, and how
through his exploitation of the earth he has created various
imbalances in nature.</p>

<h3>Government support</h3>

<p>As I have already mentioned, it is possible to government
support for this programme. Indeed, it is a particular instruction
of Srila Prabhupada that this programme should have such support.
In the Fourth Canto, verse 12.10, he states that the leaders should
support this programme of <i>prasadam</i> distribution. Such
support is also mentioned in <i>Madhya-lila</i>, when referring to
the <i>Annakuta</i> ceremony. In some areas they are already
receiving such support. For example, there are surplus schemes in
America and the European Community. They have mountains of food,
especially butter which is given by the ton. Last year we obtained
nine tons of this butter; we went out on to the street with a van
and handed out blocks of it to people (after it had first been
offered, of course), which was greatly appreciated by the public.
Your local council or MEP will be able to tell you how to obtain
such surpluses.</p>

<h3>Targeting</h3>

<p>The question is: to whom are we going to give food? Everyone
needs <i>prasadam</i>, so where do we start? In most places we go
to the homeless and the destitute to begin with because they are
usually the most accessible. They are certainly the most receptive
to <i>prasadam</i>. Your first step therefore, therefore, is to
identify where the primary need exists. Usually in the so-called
developed countries, a certain class of people will be found on the
streets. These people are usually easy to find as they tend to
congregate in certain areas. In large cities such as London, where
there are large numbers of homeless, there is no shortage of
customers for free food. It is also very good public relations
because it is such a problem . It has gone beyond to capacity of
the Social Services to cope with and they're looking to the charity
sector to help them out. In doing this, we can also gain support
from the government. It is therefore intelligent to go for the
homeless to begin with, because everyone recognises that there's a
need there. In many programmes <i>prasadam</i> is given out from a
van or a truck. Homeless people in cities will generally congregate
in one particular place. If not, you may give them the impetus to
do this by going regularly to the same place with the
<i>prasadam</i>. Do not be too impatient: you may find there are
only three people there on the first day. However, if you tell
those three people, 'We'll be back tomorrow', the next day here
will be six people, the following day several more. Therefore,
don't give after only one or two days if there are not many people.
Keep going and you will probably find that they eventually start
coming if you have identified that there is a particular need in
the area of your own town.</p>

<h3>Distributing within the community</h3>

<p>Even if there is not a homeless problem in your area, there will
almost certainly be needy groups living in the community,
particularly the elderly. These people are often neglected by their
families and are in a very impoverished condition. As this is also
a recognised area of need, it will again attract a lot of sympathy
and support. The best way to begin helping in this area is to
approach other charities who are directly involved in looking after
the aged and work with them. In England, for example, there are
charities called Help the Aged and Age Concern. You will have to
work in conjunction with such organisations for a period of time.
It's no good thinking that they are immediately going to trust you;
due to our religious convictions they will suspect ulterior motives
at first. However, if you demonstrate sincerity and a desire to
give out <i>prasadam</i> with no strings attached, they will
gradually come to accept you. They usually won't give you addresses
of individuals within the community because they have to protect
them. However, they may take the food and distribute it themselves,
and as you win their confidence they may eventually allow you to go
directly into the community and distribute.</p>

<p>There are also many families who, for one reason or another,
have had to leave their home; they couldn't afford the mortgage
repayments, the wife is kicked out by the husband who was beating
her, etc. In these case, you can also approach the Social Services
and ask them for information on this section of the community. Some
may co-operate, others may refuse to admit there's a problem that
they're not dealing with. Again, other charities will usually help;
charities network and co-operate with each other, so we must also
learn how to do this. We can gain support in this way as there are
certain agencies specifically set up to give financial support to
charities. You can obtain information on from sources such as
directories of grant-giving bodies or local government
representatives.</p>

<p>Students are another target area as they nearly always short of
money You can either distribute to individual student hostels or
from a fixed location, for example, somewhere on campus that the
student union allows you to use on a regular basis. It doesn't
necessarily have to be daily; it could be weekly to start with -
even this will have a good effect on the public's perception of
ISKCON. For instance, in Newcastle recently there was a problem
with the anti-cult people and we had certain persons in the
community come forward and support us. They made very positive
statements about us because of the Food for Life programme, even
though distribution only takes place a couple of times a week.
However, this small effort won important support when it really
mattered.</p>

<p>Prasadam distribution can also be undertaken at events such as
music festivals. There are thousands of people there and you can
give out vast amounts of <i>prasadam</i>, in addition to selling
books and chanting the holy name. However, Food for Life means
free, or heavily subsidised, food. In my opinion, food sold for
profit should not be advertised as 'Hare Krsna Food for Life'.</p>

<h3>Fixed location</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best way to distribute <i>prasadam</i> on a regular
basis is from a fixed site such as a restaurant or caf&eacute;. In
addition, there is far less stigma attached to going to a
caf&eacute; than to getting food from a truck on the street. A
donation box can be made available and people can retain their self
esteem by giving something towards their meal if they desire.
Alternatively, a small charge can be made for all they can eat. An
example of this can be found in Australia, where several 'budget
restaurants' have been opened offering unlimited <i>prasadam</i>
for fifty cents or a dollar; this has resulted in trenendously good
public relations. In England, whenever we meet an Australian on the
street, they are immediately favourable, often saying 'Oh Hare
Krsna, I ate some of your food and it was delicious.' They will
know us as being strongly committed to free or subsidised food
distribution. <i>Prasadam's</i> a big thing in Australia and has
certainly won a lot of the public and government support. We have
recently adopted this idea in Manchester and it has been very
successful. We have a shop with two rooms; one containing tables
and chairs in which free <i>prasadam</i> is served. the other
selling devotional items. We are hoping that this idea could be
tied into the <i>grhastha</i><i>-dharma</i>. A pertinent problem
our movement faces now is engaging and maintaining
<i>grhasthas</i>. Having a small preaching centre where free
<i>prasadam</i> is given out together with an outlet selling
prasadam, books, incense, etc. is something which I believe
<i>grhastha</i> couples could do quite easily.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>As I have demonstrated, there are many ways to get a Food for
Life programme started. Even if all of the above is beyond your
capabilities, you can still invite guests to eat your own
<i>prasadam</i>. Srila Prabhupada would often refer to his own
father who would always have 'two or three or even more guests for
dinner'. So where there's a will there's a way: you can always find
some way to distribute <i>prasadam</i>. However, I should emphasise
that it must be done in a compassionate mood. It is real preaching
to give a person <i>prasadam</i>, a great mercy of the Lord, and
should not be considered as just a public relations exercise. Most
importantly, try to make the <i>prasadam</i> as first-class as
possible. It really makes a difference when the food is very tasty,
hot, nicely offered, nicely served and, if possible, in vast
quantities.</p>
