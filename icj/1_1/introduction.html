    <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The idea to publish a Communications Journal came from feedback 
              we received from many devotees who have attended our Communications 
              Seminars.  Most thought it would be a good idea to transcribe lectures 
              given at the  European Communications Seminars and many also thought 
              it would be a useful forum for preachers to share their techniques, 
              experiences and realisations.  Although the seminars also fulfil 
              this latter goal, and are becoming more and more a 'marketplace' 
              for Europe's preachers, the written word certainly has its particular 
              influence and enduring effect.</p>
<p>Communications does not only mean our 'external' outreach or missionary activities but must also include an 'internal' aspect. How do we co-ordinate and co-operate?  In what ways can we perform our missionary work according to time, place and circumstance? How can we optimise our preaching potential by internal development?  We hope to deal with all aspects of communications in this publication, bringing you the considerations of devotees who are recognised experts in their fields and the results of research and study into subjects where we presently have no experts. We also very much welcome your comments and letters.</p>
            <p>In his article <a href="kdharma.html">'Food for Life'</a>, <b>Krishna Dharma 
              Dasa</b> presents us with the scriptural basis of the Hare Krishna 
              Food for Life programme. He debates whether Food for Life is, 'simply 
              an attempt to win public favour,' or, 'a programme deserving as 
              much credibility as both <i>hari-nama</i> and book distribution.'</p>
            <p><b>HH Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami</b>, in <a href="sdg.html">'The Inner Life of 
              a Preacher'</a> (part 1), tells us, 'Prabhupada says that the preacher 
              should practise what he preaches.'  To explore how a preacher in 
              today's ISKCON can begin to examine and improve his practice Satsvarupa 
              Maharaja uses the steps of the four 'Rs': Recognition, Remorse, 
              Rectification and Reunion.</p>
            <p>In <a href="rasa.html">'Developing the Schools Programme'</a>, the first in 
              a series of articles on the subject, <b>Rasamandala Dasa</b> outlines 
              the success of the schools programme within the UK.  He hopes that 
              other devotees may be encouraged to begin similar endeavours throughout 
              Europe. Future articles will discuss the benefits of such a programme 
              and will explore keys to success, both in management and presentation.</p>
            <p>Our <a href="kkd_conversation.html">interview between <b>Krishna-ksetra Dasa</b> 
              and <b>Mr Vineet Narain</b></a>, the editor of an investigative 
              video news magazine in New Delhi, offers encouragement and advice 
              to devotees in dealing with media affairs . especially the visual 
              media. Mr Narain shows us that this is a grand facility, given by 
              the Lord, by which we can reach vast audiences and advance our mission.</p>
            <p>'I have some observations to share about our ISKCON family which I've learned 
              from being a mother. I dare speak at all, not because of being a 
              learned spiritualist or having a position in ISKCON, but simply 
              because I have some practical experience being a mother .'  Thus 
              <b>Pranada Devi Dasi </b>introduces her subject <a href="pranada.html">'Building 
              an All Attractive ISKCON'</a>. Srila Prabhupada said that we should 
              display the courage of a British officer and the heart of a Bengali 
              mother. Pranada Devi Dasi displays such generous heart and indeed 
              courage, as she expresses her concern and offers her counsel for 
              ISKCON's mature and healthy development.</p>
            <p>By studying and imbibing <b>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa's</b> <a href="rsd.html">'Religion 
              and Religions'</a>, we can learn to be philosophically confident 
              relating with members of any religious tradition. Ravindra Svarupa 
              has articulated the <i>karma-jnana-bhakti</i> paradigm in such a 
              way that it can be easily applied to examine any philosophical or 
              religious system.</p>
            <p><b> <a href="knott.html">Dr Kim Knott's</a></b><a href="knott.html"> 
              review of a series of lectures by Ravindra Svarupa Dasa</a>, given 
              at the Second European Communications Seminar on the German Farm, 
              shows us how our philosophical and theological perspectives are 
              appreciated by academics, if only they get to hear them. This review 
              appeared in <i>Discus</i>, an international journal of religious 
              studies, Spring 1993 issue.</p>
            <p>In January of this year the Hungarian devotees hosted a public 
              conference in Budapest with the aim of helping the different communities 
              in Hungarian society understand ISKCON.  <b>Prof. Larry Shinn</b> 
              delivered his address <a href="shinn.html">'Religious Freedom and 
              the Psychology of Fear'</a> at that conference. Prof. Shinn concludes, 
              ' . I argue that anti-cult views are fundamentally anti-religious.  
              They are suspicious of or opposed to ANY faith that requires complete 
              religious commitment or surrender and that appeals to youthful idealism.  
              Such standards would have deprived the world of Mother Teresa and 
              Mahatma Gandhi.'</p>
            <p>Our <a href="anuttama.html">'Case Study'</a> is advice given to 
              the devotees of ISKCON Slovenia, by <b>Anuttama Dasa</b>.  Excellent 
              advice for any media emergency.</p>
            <p>And in our <a href="comments.html">'COM-ments'</a> feature we print 
              items of interest and inspiration from the ICE (ISKCON Communications 
              Europe) Conference, on our North European Bhaktivedanta Book Trust 
              electronic mail bulletin board. In this issue we print a letter 
              from <b>Mukunda Maharaja</b> and <b>Anuttama Dasa</b> on the 'Waco' 
              affair, its implications for ISKCON and how we need to respond. 
              They tell us that, 'many media relations and communications techniques 
              are systematic and have been tested for years. YOU CAN LEARN THEM. 
              So why try to reinvent the wheel?'</p>
<p>This is our first attempt and you may find many mistakes in our first issue.  We hope that any errors in publication or printing will not interfere with your enjoyment of the <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i> or our intention of faithfully serving Srila Prabhupada's mission.  We invite you to please help us by giving us your feedback and advice so that we may improve our service to you.</p>
