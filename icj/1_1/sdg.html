<h1>The Inner Life of a Preacher:<br />
 Part One</h1>

<h2><a href="contributors.html#sdg">Satsvarupa Dasa
Goswami</a></h2>

<p>Srila Prabhupada once told a priest in England that although the
boys and girls in ISKCON seemed to have a variety of engagements,
this did not mean they did not practise inner life. Srila
Prabhupada replied that inner and outer activities are all 'inner'
in Krsna consciousness because they are within the realm of
<i>daivi-prakrti</i>. If an iron rod is kept in the fire, it
eventually becomes fire. Similarly, constant engagement in Krsna
consciousness constitutes inner life. That said, I would still like
to draw a distinction between inner life and more outgoing
preaching and management. Specifically, I would like to discuss the
importance of <i>sadhana</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 5.16.3, Srila Prabhupada presents the
difference between the 'external' duties in Krsna consciousness and
strength-giving, 'internal' duties:</p>

<blockquote>In our preaching work, we deal with so much property
and money, so many books, bought and sold, but because these
dealings all pertain to the Krsna consciousness movement, they
should never be considered material. That one is absorbed in
thoughts of such management does not mean that he is outside of
Krsna consciousness. If one rigidly observes the regulative
principles of chanting sixteen rounds of the
<i>maha</i><i>-mantra</i> every day, his dealings with the material
world, for the sake of spreading the Krsna consciousness movement,
are non-different from the spiritual cultivation of Krsna
consciousness.</blockquote>

<p>There are many ways to talk about inner life, both in terms of
<i>sadhana</i> and in terms of self-development. But it is true
that everything rests on <i>sadhana</i>. Properly performing our
<i>sadhana</i> leads us to self-improvement, better relationships
with other devotees, more understanding of our relationship with
Krsna, and so on. <i>Sadhana</i> is a devotee's personal spiritual
practice - chanting and hearing.</p>

<p>Sanatana Gosvami praises Haridasa Thakura because he is
exemplary both in his behaviour (<i>sadhana</i>) and his
preaching:</p>

<blockquote>My dear sir, you are chanting the holy name three
hundred thousand times daily and informing everyone of the
importance of such chanting. Some behave very well but do not
preach Krsna consciousness, whereas others preach but do not behave
properly. You simultaneously perform both duties in relation to the
holy name, by your personal behaviour and by your preaching.
Therefore, you are the spiritual master of the entire world for you
are the most advanced devotee in the world.' And Srila Prabhupada
comments: 'Similarly, members of the Krsna consciousness movement
chant a minimum of sixteen rounds a day, at the same time they must
preach the cult of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. One who does so is quite
fit to become a spiritual master for the entire world. (CC Antya
4.101-3).</blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> ('Teachings to Sanatana
Gosvami'), there is a very clear description of inner and outer
life as it develops from the spontaneous stage of devotional
service. This implies that in the beginning, inner life is not so
developed. According to Bhaktivinoda Thakura,
<i>vaidhi</i><i>-bhakti</i> means going through the motions of
spiritual life because <i>sadhana</i> is performed out of duty
devoid of spontaneous love. Inner life, therefore, develops
according to the spontaneous stage. At that point, outer and inner
life continue symbiotically. Lord Caitanya said to Sanatana
Gosvami:</p>

<blockquote>There are two processes by which one may execute this
<i>raganuga</i><i>-bhakti</i>, external and internal. When
self-realised, the advanced devotee externally remains like a
neophyte and executes all the <i>sastric</i> injunctions,
especially hearing and chanting. However, in his mind, in his
original, purified, self-realised position, he serves Krsna in
Vrindavan in his particular way. He serves Krsna twenty-four hours
a day, day and night. (CC Madhya 22.156-7).</blockquote>

<p>It is therefore important for devotees to take time to perform
<i>sadhana</i>.</p>

<p>Most devotees feel the need to practise good <i>sadhana</i>, but
often, practising good <i>sadhana</i> seems to conflict with other
duties. How should a devotee respond? How can a devotee find the
balance? Just to realise that there is such a thing as an
individual's way is to face responsibility. ISKCON cannot define or
legislate what each of us should become or how to fulfill our
deepest spiritual needs. There is an individual level of spiritual
life, just as there is an institutional one for members of ISKCON.
I remember reading St. Francis of Assisi's last words as they were
recorded in his biography. He was surrounded by followers and
disciples and had developed a movement of thousands. He said, 'I
have done what I had to do in serving Christ. Now you find your
way.' It is not possible for everyone to imitate a charismatic
leader. We have to follow him. By seeing his enthusiasm, we can
became more enthusiastic in our services. It is not that we think
we have to take up the details of the leader's service; we have to
develop the inner meaning of that service within ourselves.
Although everyone in ISKCON practises <i>sadhana</i>, we all have
to find our own ways to develop it and make advancement.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, I would like to quote from my book,
<i>Chota's</i> <i>Way</i>. Although it is not scripture, it is
relevant to this discussion. <i>Chota's</i> <i>Way</i> is a
fictional account of a devotee finding his own way to serve guru
and Krsna. Chota, the main character, experiences both internal and
external obstacles as he tries to both increase and refine his
<i>sadhana</i> while serving in the Krsna consciousness movement.
Chota is one of the first devotees to preach in Guyana. He is a
pioneer, and because he has been steady over the years, he has
become a spiritual leader for the younger devotees. The book opens
with Chota being honoured as a spiritual master. The other
character (Yamala) is his foil, although they are godbrothers and
friends. Yamala was also a pioneer in the Guyanese preaching, and
he is also respected by the younger devotees. But Yamala has
developed his service more as a manager. A third character, Arjuna,
is mentioned briefly. Arjuna is Chota's brother. He has become
embittered and is making propaganda against both the movement and
Chota. Arjuna says that Chota is not a bona fide spiritual leader
because he has faults, and he says that the movement is not bona
fide because it is based on concocted principles. In this way, he
is stirring up trouble among the devotees at the various centres in
Guyana.</p>

<p>The first glimpse we get of Chota is when he is sitting on the
<i>vyasasana</i> listening to the praises of his followers. Chota
is dissatisfied. As soon as he gets the chance, he tries to convey
to the audience that although they are praising him as a great
devotee, he lacks taste for the basic practices of chanting and
hearing. He ask them to help him, to bless him or to somehow
facilitate him:</p>

<p>I have a personal request. If I am actually to serve you and
other living beings, then I have to be a fit devotee, but at
present, I am not fit. I do not have a taste for the most basic
practices of chanting and hearing, so I humbly request you to
please allow me to pursue the basic <i>sadhana</i> of Vaishavism,
of which I have so far not realised even a drop. Without this
higher taste, all my activities are actually trivial and farcical.
Please give me your mercy in this very tangible and practical way
so that one day, I can actually become a genuine chanter and reader
of Prabhupada's books. Only then can I convince others to do the
same.'</p>

<p>The assembled devotees thought that Chota's speech was very
nice. They held a big <i>kirtan</i> when he was finished speaking,
then a feast. They were happy that Chota was so humble.</p>

<p>After the feast, Chota goes to his room. Yamala is waiting for
him, pacing back and forth and filled with the news of the success
Arjuna's propaganda is having. He pushes Chota to do something in
response. Chota agrees to 'do the needful'. He adds:</p>

<p>'Yamala, listen. Here's what I think. Our response to these
criticisms should be to improve our spiritual lives. I want to take
more time for chanting and reading. This is the leadership which is
required, not just to spread counter-propaganda. I would like to
work full-time on my chanting and my study of Praphupada's
books.'</p>

<p>'What?!' Yamala's mouth fell open in disbelief, 'This is not
time for weakness, Prabhu.'</p>

<p>'You call a desire to hear and chant a weakness?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Yamala said. 'Remember in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i><i>,</i>
how when Arjuna wanted to retire from the battle, what did Krsna
do? He chastised him .Chanting and reading is <i>babaji</i> stuff.
We are preachers and you're the leader. You can't retire. We've got
to confront this menace. Call meetings, make a tour, go to Arjuna
and tell him he has to stop or else. Don't allow him even to visit
the temples. He has to leave Guyana. Many devotees are already
bewildered by him and you've got to tell them to do their regular
work.'</p>

<p>'I agree,' said Chota in a subdued voice, 'but there has to be a
time . '</p>

<p>'This isn't a time for chanting and hearing,' said Yamala.
'Listen, I'd like to take time for that myself. I'm about a hundred
rounds behind in my quota and I haven't read a page in weeks. I'm
not proud of that, but I know I have to fight so that our spiritual
movement can be protected . As far as I'm concerned, chanting and
introspection are luxuries, although I know they're the goal of
life. There is no time for them now. We have to get out and fight.
We're declaring war on <i>maya</i>.'</p>

<p>Chota resigns himself, and he paces the floor to finish his last
few rounds before going to sleep. 'This is a mess,' he thinks as he
grinds out the last round, 'but tomorrow I am going to get up
early, and before anything happens, I am going to read Krsna book.'
When he does read Krsna book early the next morning, Chota
experiences the taste he is hankering for and he immediately
becomes convinced that <i>sadhana</i> is important to him.</p>

<p>Chota paused and looked up thoughtfully from the page. Unless
one regularly heard these narrations, how would it be possible to
remember the form and activities of the Supreme Lord? And without
remembering Krsna, how is it possible to be a devotee? It was not
enough just to belong to a movement or to wear a team jacket.</p>

<p>Chota allowed his greed to read Prabhupada's books fill him
without guilt. He felt a conviction that Prabhupada was pleased
with him and that he should not squelch his growing desires. Chota
thought, 'Hearing about Krsna is the most important thing.
Unfortunately, although the devotees are enthusiastic, they do not
know yet of the importance of reading. They praise me for reading,
yet they don't seek to do it for themselves.'</p>

<p>This was the predicament: Chota was being praised as a great
leader among the devotees, but he knew he did not deeply appreciate
reading or chanting. And if the leader has no taste, what can he
expect from his followers? It is a subtle form of hypocrisy if a
leader tries to enthuse others to practise <i>sadhana</i> without
practising it wholeheartedly himself. That hypocrisy should pinch
us as it pinched Chota. And we should recognise that subtle
hypocrisy can often lead to gross hypocrisy. 'Even if no one else
encourages me,' Chota thought, 'I must find a means to concentrate
on hearing and chanting.'</p>

<p>So Chota goes on tour. Halfway through the tour, he decides to
take a three-day retreat to work on <i>sadhana</i>. The devotees in
the temple he is visiting provide him with a secluded house and a
<i>brahmacari</i> assistant, and Chota begins to chant. He chants
through a whole day, although he experiences dryness. He dedicates
the second day to reading. His assistant becomes bored and leaves,
and eventually Chota, feeling alone, ends his retreat early and
returns to the temple. As soon as he arrives, Yamala is on the
phone with the latest crisis: a scandal in the south. Chota is sent
to sort it out. In the course of these events, Chota is diagnosed
with an ulcer. In a sudden move, he decides to take a sabbatical,
mailing a note to Yamala:</p>

<p>'I'm going to take a sabbatical for increasing chanting and
hearing. I will do it for a year. I will keep in touch. Please
don't be angry with me. I'm trying to improve myself to be a better
servant. I'm sure you'll be able to handle things in my
absence.'</p>

<p>I'm not offering Chota's behaviour as ideal. He was under stress
and this is how he responded. Even though he found a solitary beach
to live on, he quickly realised that even this apparently remote
place was still filled with distractions and interruptions to his
chanting. But he also noticed that he was starting to break through
the mechanical practice of chanting and hearing. He began to feel
that his <i>sadhana</i> was developing substance. At that point,
Yamala and another devotee, Pandita Dasa arrive:</p>

<p>'The jig is up, Chota,' said Yamala in a loud voice. 'I've come
to bring you back to your duties.' Yamala was wearing his team
jacket and sweating. He carried a heavy-looking suitcase. 'You
really picked an outpost. I had to walk the last mile. Got anything
to drink?'</p>

<p>'Please sit down,' said Chota.</p>

<p>'No thanks,' said Yamala. 'Maybe you'd better sit down.' Yamala
looked around, displeased. 'I can see,' he said, 'that you have
deviated from Prabhupada.'</p>

<p>'Don't talk like that,' said Chota, 'or I'll ask you to leave.
Why can't you accept that I'm different from you and not be so
judgmental? Accept me as I am.'</p>

<p>'Why should I accept you as you are?' asked Yamala. 'That's
bogus. There is such a thing as right and wrong, you know. It's not
that everything is one.'</p>

<p>Pandita Dasa has been brought along to provide scriptural
statements against what Chota is doing, and they argue back and
forth. Pandita reads: 'This is from Prabhupada's purport in the
<i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>: "At the present moment, we see that
some of the members of ISKCON are intending to leave their
preaching activities in order to sit in a solitary place. This is
not a very good sign. It's a fact that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakura has condemned this practice for neophytes." He
then says that only after one is very mature could he sit in a
solitary place.'</p>

<p>When Chota tries to present another side of the issue from
Prabhupada's books, Yamala cuts him off. Then Chota explains that
he isn't giving up his duties permanently, but just taking a year's
absence to do remedial work on his <i>sadhana</i>.</p>

<p>Although Chota and Yamala are expressing different extremes on
these issues, there is also a synthesis which each of us has to
find for ourselves: what is preaching? The six Goswamis were great
preachers. They distributed Krsna consciousness all over India. How
did they do it? They practised <i>bhajana</i> and wrote books.
Chota says:</p>

<p>'I think that our whole movement needs more examples of devotees
who go back to the basics. We're too much caught up in solving
problems and worrying about money and public relations. At least I
was too caught up. If you had given me time to practise my
<i>sadhana</i>, I wouldn't have had to act in this extreme way to
get what you should have given me gladly.'</p>

<p>Still, Yamala and Pandita Dasa gradually erode Chota's
conviction and he agrees to return with them the next day. Later,
Yamala approaches Chota in a different mood and confesses that he
has had trouble following the principles and has even seen a
prostitute a few times. Yamala says:</p>

<p>'Another reason I have become so weak is that I've been working
too hard. I think it was good for me to come here and see how
you're living with so much attention to your spiritual needs. I
couldn't do it myself. I see your point, but I have to do the
needful for the movement. I'll die fighting on the battlefield of
<i>sankirtan</i> rather than become a <i>babaji</i>. What if we all
left like you did? Won't you please come back?'</p>

<p>Devotees often quote this statement that they would rather die
on the battlefield than retire. It reminds me of the time Jagadisa
Maharaja asked, 'What shall we do to stop this person?' Prabhupada
answered in a philosophical way. He said that in a war, some
soldiers will fall. There will be casualties. But we should try not
to become casualties. If devotees are fixed up by reading my books,
then even if this person tries to convince them, they will not give
it up.' Jagadisa Maharaja uses that incident to advocate the
importance of reading Prabhupada's books. The spirit of wanting to
die on the battlefield is nice, but why unnecessarily become a
casualty? Discretion is the better part of valour.</p>

<p>Yamala doesn't really seem to have understood what he can do to
help himself. He finally says to Chota:</p>

<p>'I think your spiritual advancement is a luxury at this
stage.'</p>

<p>Although Chota decides not to go back to Guyana after all, he
wonders whether what he is doing is actually pleasing to his
spiritual master. Eventually, he decides to go and find his
spiritual master and ends up in New York, preaching at 26 Second
Avenue about the subject closest to his heart: 'Let's talk about
this problem,' said Chota, 'of not having taste and of neglecting
<i>sadhana</i>.' The devotees knew that this was Chota's specialty
and when he spoke about it, it aroused their own desires for
<i>sadhana</i>. Some devotees admitted their lackings. Other's
became defensive. A few weren't sure whether Chota himself knew how
to keep the balance between work and <i>sadhana</i>. But all
devotees respected him for his dedication to hearing and chanting.
This leaves Chota in the same dilemma again, that since coming to
New York, although he was preaching about improved <i>sadhana</i>,
his own attempts to improve were a fond memory. He felt he was
talking about a yearning he used to have.</p>

<p>Finally, his spiritual master arrives in New York and Chota is
able to confide in him. In the final scene of the book, Chota's
guru advises him: 'Don't be afraid to be yourself. If you are
feeling strong desires to intensify your <i>sadhana</i>, don't
suppress them, they are good desires. One may have to wait many,
many lifetimes to have such desires. So don't let your Godbrothers
intimidate you by calling you <i>a babaji</i> or whatever. You may
not be exactly like them. I was trying to make this point last
night in the lecture. Each individual, even in the liberated stage,
has a very particular <i>rasa</i> with Krsna. So even now, your
<i>rasa</i> should be respected. But you have to start by
respecting it yourself. Don't be guilty or wishy-washy.'</p>

<p>Chota's guru assures Chota that his way is very individual and
personal and that he shouldn't doubt himself. Then he explains the
principle of <i>prabhu-datta-desa</i>. Chota has such a nice
preaching field in Guyana. He shouldn't give it up. But in
returning there, he doesn't have to stop being himself: 'You can
chant and hear in your <i>prabhu-datta-desa</i>. The other devotees
will learn to accept you. They will see, even if they don't follow
your example, 'That's Chota's way. That's how he is serving
Krsna."'</p>

<p>And Chota was encouraged to help others find their ways. 'Do
both. Be well-behaved and preach.'</p>

<p>So that's the lesson from our story. When the synthesis is
realised between outer responsibilities and inner life, then we
discover the depth and excitement of Krsna consciousness. Lord
Caitanya is the best example. 'To deliver all fallen souls, the
Lord travelled from country to country and personally tasted the
transcendental pleasure of devotional service and He simultaneously
spread the cult of devotion everywhere'. (<i>CC Madhya</i> 25.64).
Purport: 'By His personal behaviour, He has given an example for
devotees to follow.' Prabhupada also said that if only one person
becomes a pure devotee of the Lord by reading his
<i>Bhagavad-gita</i><i>,</i>, he would consider his attempt a
success.</p>

<p>Devotees sometimes ask how we can verify our 'way' with Srila
Prabhupada after his disappearance. But this need to implore
Prabhupada has been arranged for us by Krsna. We now have to learn
to serve Prabhupada according to our heart's desire. In the
beginning stages, the father tells the child what to do. When the
child becomes bewildered, he can always go to his father for
instruction. But now we have to find Prabhupada in his books and in
our hearts. We have to pray to him; we have to make more of an
endeavour, even though it's difficult. Prabhupada can also speak
through his followers. We have to take counsel from all those
sources - Prabhupada's books, other devotees, and our own hearts -
and serve in whatever way enhances our surrender to Prabhupada.
Prabhupada sometimes spoke like this. When a devotee in Bombay
asked Prabhupada how he should serve, Prabhupada responded by
saying, 'No, I want to know what you want to do.' We are supposed
to offer our whole lives to Prabhupada; therefore, we have to work
from a platform where we can naturally give our love.
Soul-searching is not easy but we have to do it anyway. There are
even some advantages to doing it now, challenged by Prabhupada's
disappearance. He is there, he is guiding us, but now we have to be
more mature and show him how we want to serve him.</p>

<p>Another question that arises is how householders can find the
balance. They may want to practise serious <i>sadhana</i>, but they
may be entangled in so many family matters and business. A devotee
should be living every day as if it is his last, and yet he cannot
neglect his day-to-day responsibilities. But <i>sadhana</i> will
yield everything we can desire from spiritual life. Prabhupada gave
us a framework to practise hearing and chanting regardless of our
<i>asramas</i>. In describing how Narada Muni travelled as
<i>parivrajikacarya</i>, Prabhupada said, 'It is not that we have
to be like Narada Muni, but one can stay in any place and by
chanting the holy names, even in family life, very easily one can
do it.' Our problem is that we neglect what we can do.
<i>Sadhana</i> is available even within a life of stress. We don't
have to wait until all the children are grown or until we develop
more spontaneous taste. We may not live that long. We have to begin
now.</p>

<p>On the practical side, whether for <i>grhasthas</i> or busy
temple managers, preachers or mothers, we have to examine our
schedules and cut out those things that are not urgent. We don't
need to be driven to extreme behaviour like Chota. Whatever we can
do, we should do it immediately. There is nothing more important in
this life than attending to <i>sadhana</i>. We have to find the
means. Srila Prabhupada was exemplary in this way. Even in his day
as a householder businessman, Prabhupada always meditated on how to
serve his spiritual master's mission. Krsna is known as
<i>bhava-grahi-janardana</i>. He knows the essence of a devotee's
desires. Our eligibility to choose our own way is attained in a
very personal way. It comes with age and some advancement and some
time spent 'doing the needful'. When a devotee continually
sacrifices his personal interest in the name of the greater
interest, he or she may find that they keep coming up with a sense
of rightness about how they should be engaging in service. It can
actually be a form of taking responsibility for one's own spiritual
life to recognise that 'rightness'. Prabhupada built a house for
everyone. But by training ourselves in surrender first, when it is
time to find our own way in spiritual life, we will be less tempted
by whimsy.</p>

<p>But what if our <i>sadhana</i> is actually distracted? There
should be no question of putting <i>sadhana</i> aside even for a
few years. Lost time is lost time in this life of measured breaths.
If our <i>sadhana</i> is distracted, we can take that distraction
and turn it into spiritual anxiety. Those so-called distracted
rounds can actually become very dear to us and be the key to our
learning how to call to Krsna.</p>

<p>It is not just by working hard in this movement that we will go
back to Goloka Vrindavan. We have to develop a specific attraction,
a personal relationship with Krsna. That relationship will be
manifest to us through <i>sadhana</i> as we move from 'going
through the motions' to spontaneous love.</p>

<p>One last purport from Prabhupada: 'It is therefore requested
that all our devotees in the ISKCON community become pure
Vaishnavas so that by their mercy, all the people of the world will
be transferred to Vaikunthaloka even without their knowledge'. (CC
Antya-lila 1.32). Therefore, when devotees become pure, real
preaching can take place and we can convince others. Then we will
have achieved the synthesis between 'outer' and 'inner'.</p>
