            <p>It was with great satisfaction that I read the introduction and 

              texts of presentations to the GBC from respected Vaisnavis. It is 

              due, in great part, to their dedication that there is now a greater 

              mood of including women as full ISKCON members. For instance, to 

              my amazement, H. H. Gopal Krsna Maharaja invited me to deliver a 

              <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> lecture in Delhi in April although he was 

              scheduled to do it. In Mayapur, I was happy to have a place to see 

              Radha-Madhava for <i>mangala</i> <i>arati</i> without fear of the 

              men bumping into me. I could even chant <i>japa </i>in the temple 

              room! </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>However, when I was invited to deliver a scriptural lecture in 

              Mayapur, during the usual morning class, it was in a facility outside 

              of that normally given for the English ­<i>Bhagavatam </i>class. 

              There is no objection to a woman speaking on the scriptures to devotees 

              and guests on temple property during the official class time, as 

              long as the class is in a separate place. Clearly the Mayapur administration 

              knows that the spirit of its restrictions is incorrect, but it still 

              enforces them to the letter. In Mumbai I encountered the same situation 

              - an invitation to speak on <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> during the morning 

              class, but not in the temple room. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Besides the simple fact of inertia - these rules and procedures 

              have existed for a while and we may find it hard to change course 

              - I read in all the presentations the pull between our external 

              and spiritual duties. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The many times that Prabhupada speaks and writes about women's 

              position in society, or the psychological differences between men 

              and women, he is dealing with our external duties. I do not agree 

              with some of the authors that the societal/economic model of <i>varna</i><i>s</i><i>rama</i> 

              is antiquated or irrelevant. Perhaps it cannot be fully established 

              in the present age, however, its establishment to any degree will 

              help all of us achieve the spiritual platform. A sane and stable 

              society makes spiritual progress easier, whereas a disrupted society 

              makes it more difficult. The lack of engaging everyone, not only 

              women, in their external duties according to their propensities, 

              and the lack of solid, functioning families with a pious economic 

              base, has led to many ISKCON members being without a foundation 

              for their spiritual practices. Prabhupada writes that the purpose 

              of marriage is to make the mind peaceful for spiritual life. A peaceful 

              marriage is much more likely when both the man and woman work with 

              their natural differences. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>To promote a revival of ancient mores of female behaviour is laudable. 

              However, as the presentations indicate it has been very difficult 

              to practically apply these within ISKCON. I would suggest that there 

              are three reasons for this. First, we do not understand ancient 

              <i>varna</i><i>s</i><i>rama</i>. Second, we often practise our already 

              distorted understanding hypocritically. Third, we do not distinguish 

              between external and spiritual duties. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Our modern understanding of <i>varna</i><i>s</i><i>rama</i>, especially 

              as it relates to a woman's place in it, is often grossly inaccurate. 

              For many years ISKCON leaders described women as a fifth class. 

              However, the scriptures clearly describe women in all four <i>varnas</i> 

              as having distinct psychological natures befitting their class. 

              We think women made little economic contribution in ancient times, 

              whereas in reality they had duties in both their <i>varna</i> and 

              <i>a</i><i>s</i><i>rama</i>. In terms of women's interactions with 

              their male protectors, there are many stories of chaste women, glorified 

              as socially ideal, who do not fit our modern conception of 'submissive'. 

              Sometimes ISKCON members equate the culture of a part of modern 

              India with <i>varna</i><i>s</i><i>rama</i>, although it is well 

              known that there are many practices there which are a result of 

              British and Muslim influence or just degradation over time. We have 

              to carefully sort out what is and is not Vedic culture. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>We have also applied our misunderstood ideas about women's social 

              place in a hypocritical manner. For example, many temples have forbidden 

              women from various services yet send the same women away from their 

              husbands and young children in order to earn money for the temple. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The fundamental problem of using Prabhupada's good, clear and applicable 

              instructions on the cultural place of women in order to deny women 

              spiritual facility, is not misunderstanding or hypocrisy, but the 

              confusion between external and spiritual duties. Most of the women 

              who made presentations stated how Prabhupada distinguished between 

              the two, both in theory and in his own example. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Prabhupada writes in the purport to <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 9.30, 

              'In the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the 

              conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. 

              But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one 

              another.' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Our spiritual duties of hearing, chanting, remembering, offering 

              prayers, and so on, are fully on the transcendental platform and, 

              while usually in harmony with our external duties, may sometimes 

              appear to conflict with them. For example, culturally, the women 

              serve the men in the family and eat when they are done, but spiritually 

              the men and women equally view the Deity of the Lord. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I can only echo, therefore, the requests of the women who spoke 

              so eloquently - let us live our philosophy. Let us live the traditional 

              cultural aspects Prabhupada taught us as much as we can in our present 

              time, as ISKCON shares with the rest of the world a desperate need 

              for societal stability. And let us also live, simultaneously, the 

              principles of equality of spiritual service that he taught us. </p>
