            <p>Books about spiritual paths, God, yoga, the mysteries, always leave 

              me a bit apprehensive. Are they a waste of time? Wouldn't it be 

              better to just go and do it, and then talk? But wait, perhaps this 

              writer knows what he is talking about and it will remind me of similar 

              experiences and then, maybe I am not alone. So we continue to read. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Steven J. Rosen has written <i>Gita on the Green - The Mystical 

              Tradition Behind Bagger Vance</i> with something similar in mind. 

              Perhaps you are against war, he ventures, perhaps you don't care 

              about spiritual matters, perhaps, as I have done,<i> </i>you are 

              looking for a life that has more meaning following the teachings 

              of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, as I have done. But if this text is 

              too esoteric for you, what about golf? Let me tell you how the game 

              of golf is precisely what the <i>Gita</i> is teaching about life's 

              mysteries. As Rosen says: 'It [<i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>] 

              places the spirit of the <i>Gita </i>on a new playing field'. (p. 

              21) </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Golf equals <i>Gita</i>? The greens on a golf course equal the 

              rough soil of life? Not everybody wins? There is only one victor, 

              Krsna? And what about the others on the course, what about those 

              who do not make the cut? And those who always finish second, or 

              in the top ten - are they equal to Krsna? Is the 'sport' of golf 

              equal to the '<i>lila</i>' of Krsna? One would think that the writer 

              has found himself the perfect slogan: 'Have metaphor will travel'. 

              One can easily hear the old mystical motorcycle of <i>Zen and the 

              Art of Motorcycle Maintenance </i>riding down the road once again. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Rosen bases his metaphorical approach on Steven Pressfield's 1995 

              novel<i>, The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>, which was recently made 

              into a major motion picture. Pressfield was so taken with Rosen's 

              book that he has written a glowing foreword for <i>Gita on the Green</i>. 

              Both Pressfield and Krsna loom large in this book, and centuries 

              of <i>Gita</i> commentaries influence every page. Interestingly, 

              Rosen's approach to the <i>Gita</i> is far from metaphorical - it 

              comes smack in the literal tradition of the Vaisnava sages. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Metaphors can only go so far. For instance, the author of <i>Gita 

              on the Green</i> doesn't play golf - at least it seems this way 

              to me - so he has no experience of that 'zoning' phenomenon so close 

              to and also so distant from the 'oceanic experience' of religious 

              ecstasy. In the 'zoning' of golf, the most the player gets is a 

              release of endorphin, giving him/her a momentary high. In sport 

              - as much as in hallucinogenic-induced experiences - all the bodily 

              mutations of the participant are simply biochemical. In the truly 

              religious experience, on the other hand - the experience that is 

              a product of religious practice, yoga or the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              - the change is electromagnetic, a whole new human emerges. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>So you see, the game is more serious than it might appear by the 

              use of golf as a metaphor. This is <i>lila</i>, no longer merely 

              a sport. A detached movement from one self to the other and back 

              with more than what one started with at the beginning of the trip. 

              For this description alone the book <i>Gita on the Green</i> is 

              worth reading. In the chapter entitled 'Tee for Two' (pp. 31-8), 

              Steven Rosen describes with candid fervour the relationship of Krsna 

              and Radha and how Krsna, to be Krsna, also has to be Radha, and 

              in this <i>lila</i> exchange He becomes the complete Krsna - the 

              one who without Radha He would not have been able to become. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>'The "One Reality,"' the author writes, quoting a sage named Krsnadasa, 

              'is simply an inferior, impersonal manifestation of Radha and Krsna. 

              If you study our Indian scriptures closely, you'll see that the 

              One is not really One but it is Two.' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>'His words,' the author continues, 'struck me like a ton of bricks 

              ... Here I was in India, halfway around the world, looking for the 

              ultimate One Reality - and now they tell me that the One is ultimately 

              Two!' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It is obvious that the author has raised the bar when playing the 

              <i>Gita</i>. His search is unrelenting. Much later on, as he starts 

              to glimpse the complexities of spiritual life, Steven Rosen asks 

              his teacher, 'Do the Two ever become One again?' 'Yes!' 'Yes' is 

              the answer, and thus he is introduced to Caitanya and the Vaisnava 

              tradition. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The rest of the book, which presents Rosen's interpretation of 

              the <i>Gita,</i> is bathed in the loving ink of medieval Hindu mystics, 

              like Madhva and Caitanya, and the modern holy man Prabhupada. The 

              main thrust of the book is <i>bhakti</i>, consecrated devotion to 

              the ideals of the <i>Gita</i> as passed to him by this tradition. 

              And the work is sound and personal and contemporary. For this reason, 

              <i>Gita on the Green</i> will be of use to those teaching <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              in academia. Rosen shows that the <i>Gita</i> can be explained in 

              a contemporary context, using golf and a novel about golf to illuminate 

              the <i>Gita's</i> teachings and philosophy. This will allow today's 

              students an entrance into an otherwise difficult text. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Rosen divides the <i>Gita</i> into three parts: The first six chapters 

              discuss karma, or action. The second six focus on <i>bhakti,</i> 

              or loving devotion, and the final six are on <i>jnana,</i> or knowledge. 

              This is a convenient way to understand the <i>Gita,</i> making the 

              text readable and accessible for a modern audience. He goes through 

              each chapter with care, all the while keeping in mind the golf metaphor 

              and the story of Bagger Vance. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The first chapters on the <i>Gita</i> are dedicated to the crisis 

              of Arjuna, the warrior in turmoil. As the battle of Kuruksetra is 

              about to begin, Arjuna starts to tremble and shake, his hair stands 

              on end, his bow falls from his hands - he is in a deep crisis. Rosen 

              correctly focuses on the fact that this refers not just to war but 

              to every action a human performs, as Krsna explains and the author 

              echoes: 'We are all spiritual warriors ... there is war raging within.' 

              (pp. 53-4) Throughout the second and third chapters Krsna's philosophical 

              counselling helps Arjuna to gain distance, and Arjuna begins to 

              talk, act - to find his swing. He goes through first one yoga, then 

              another, memories of the past that are embedded deep within, all 

              leading to the one spot he has avoided - his heart. The author summarises 

              this quest for love - <i>bhakti - </i>in what he considers the essence 

              of all the teachings of the <i>Gita</i>, which is found in chapter 

              ten. Rosen calls these the 'nutshell' verses and describes what 

              they say in seven broad strokes: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>These verses from 8 through 11 affirm that (1) Krsna is the origin 

                of everything. (2) Those who are wise engage in his loving service. 

                (3) They always think of him. (4) Discuss his attributes - and 

                this (5) brings them great pleasure. (6) Krsna grants (them) full 

                enlightenment, and concomitantly (7) destroys their ignorance. 

              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>The rest of Rosen's <i>Gita on the Green</i> focuses on knowledge 

              and how knowledge, properly guided, can lead to love. He shows the 

              cosmic form of Krsna, with exciting parallels from <i>The Legend 

              of Bagger Vance,</i> and explains how a man of knowledge might be 

              recognised. The teaching of this section, aptly understood by Rosen, 

              may be summarised with the following slogan: 'Act always with detachment 

              from the accompanying sensations that come with the fruits of every 

              action'. In Sanskrit this is called <i>phalabhogaviragah. </i>People 

              usually translate this as detachment from action. This is false. 

              Detachment can only be from the <i>bhoga,</i> the enjoying spirit, 

              or the accidents that accompany action, joy, depression, highs, 

              lows. Action is inevitable. Wise action is only possible with open 

              frontal lobes as a result of an open heart. The rest is history, 

              and this is what most interpreters of the <i>Gita</i> have given 

              us - merely history. Fortunately, Steven Rosen gives us more, and 

              for this reason his book should be read by those trained in the 

              art of spiritual love. And by those who would like to be so trained. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>There is one final point that, unless explained, might baffle the 

              reader. The author tells a fictitious story, as the book comes to 

              a close, of the man who loved golf and at the end of his life went 

              to Hell and found out that in Hell they had beautiful greens, top-of-the-line 

              irons - but no balls. This, for the golf-lover, was hell. Unfortunately, 

              this story does not really work in the case of the <i>Gita</i>. 

              Or, shall we say, there is a deeper way to view the truths expressed 

              herein. This becomes clear if we consider the following: What we 

              have in the <i>Gita</i> is a passage from crisis to action with 

              freedom and detachment. All this is achieved through the process 

              of yoga, and what is yoga if not a game of golf without a ball; 

              a whole imaginative technology that guides the body imaginatively 

              to be other bodies, other embodiments and other liberating and liberated 

              forms of action. In other words, the example of golf without a ball 

              would rather refer to life on this earth with a body and the skills 

              of yoga rather than to Hell. Hell with green, irons, caddies and 

              no balls would be heaven for a golfer of the spirit, or as the author 

              seems to suggest, the life of the spirit is real hell for a golfer 

              without a ball. </p>
