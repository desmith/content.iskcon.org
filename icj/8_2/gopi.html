            <p class="maintext"><i>Gopiparanadhana Dasa, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust 

              (BBT) Sanskrit editor and translator for more than 25 years, addresses 

              the difference between Western and Eastern approaches to textual 

              authority. By examining texts from Srila Prabhupada's commentaries 

              he highlights the difference between Western ideas of plagiarism, 

              and the primacy of originality, and ­Eastern notions of ensuring 

              the safe passage of traditional thought. He also looks at how in 

              Indian traditions the qualification for authorship is based on the 

              ability to faithfully transmit the message of previous teachers, 

              but not necessarily with the same painstaking referencing demanded 

              in modern texts. </i></p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was 

              the founder and organiser of a large worldwide religious movement; 

              that he developed it in just twelve years, all after his seventieth 

              birthday, shows that he was not only practical, innovative and determined 

              but also spiritually empowered. Although these are valid reasons 

              to think highly of Srila Prabhupada, he always de-emphasised his 

              own abilities, preferring to be judged on the more objective grounds 

              of his bona fide<i> </i>allegiance to the teachings of the Vaisnava 

              tradition he represented. He did not credit his preaching success 

              to any special abilities of his own. As he once said, 'I don't claim 

              that I am a pure devotee or perfect, but my only qualification is 

              that I am trying to follow the instruction of the perfect.'<a name="1"></a>[<a href="#1F" class="maintext">1</a>] 

              In any case, spiritual realisation is essentially a private matter, 

              not open to objective evaluation. There are too many false saints 

              who allow their disciples to fanatically advertise them as much 

              greater than they really are. In the opinion of orthodox Vaisnavas, 

              the saintliness of a person can be known only by someone just as 

              saintly. To publicly establish spiritual authority, then, a teacher, 

              rather than making an open spectacle of his intimate ecstasies, 

              should simply speak philosophically on the basis of what previous 

              authorities have said in scripture and on reputable commentaries 

              of scripture. Srila Prabhupada wanted his own authority to be accepted 

              according to how faithfully he lived up to that standard. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">The Gaudiya school of Vaisnavism to which Srila 

              Prabhupada belongs was founded by Caitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal 

              five centuries ago. This Gaudiya <i>sampradaya</i> is officially 

              connected with the Vaisnava school established by Madhva in the 

              thirteenth century and also has strong philosophical and cultural 

              bonds with the even older Srivaisnava school of Ramanuja. Although 

              the founding teachers of other Vaisnava schools<i> </i>each wrote 

              major commentaries on Badarayana Vyasa's <i>Vedanta-sutra</i> and 

              their followers carried on debate with Advaita impersonalists and 

              others on the basis of their theistic interpretation of <i>Vedanta,</i> 

              ­Caitanya Mahaprabhu chose not to busy His own followers in the 

              same way. He proposed that the ancient <i>Bhagavata Purana </i>(known 

              also as <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>) served perfectly well as a natural 

              commentary on the <i>Vedanta-sutra</i>, having been written by the 

              same ­Veda-vyasa. Lord Caitanya advised His associates that since 

              the <i>Bhagavatam</i> was already available and easily understandable, 

              there was no need for them to compose new commentaries and sub-­commentaries 

              on <i>Vedanta</i>.<i> </i>Another <i>Purana, </i>the <i>Garuda Purana, 

              </i>corroborates Lord Caitanya's reliance on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam:</i>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Srila Prabhupada considered <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, 

              along with <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, the<i> </i>substantial foundation 

              of his International Society for Krishna Consciousness. He created 

              ISKCON primarily for making the theology of the <i>Gita </i>and 

              <i>Bhagavatam</i> universally accessible, and he directed his disciples 

              to give first priority to the work of publishing and distributing 

              these two scriptures, in English and many other languages. Srila 

              Prabhupada's <i>opus magnum,</i> a multi-volume English translation 

              of and commentary on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i> was unfortunately 

              left incomplete when he passed away in 1977; it was finished, however, 

              ten years later by the collaborative effort of a few of his disciples. 

              Having served as an editor of this entire series of the <i>Bhagavatam</i> 

              and participated in its posthumous completion, I have gathered some 

              insights into Srila Prabhupada's hermeneutic methodology. In this 

              essay, I will examine Srila Prabhupada's translation and commentary 

              on one verse from <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i> with the aim of showing 

              how he based his own presentation largely on the commentaries of 

              previous authorities. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext"><i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> is presented as literal, 

              albeit very ancient, history. A few narrations in this <i>Purana, 

              </i>however, are intended to be understood as fiction - most of 

              them allegories devised by one of the most frequent speakers in 

              the <i>Bhagavatam,</i> the itinerant preacher Narada. The text we 

              are going to look at belongs to one of these allegorical passages, 

              the story of King Puranjana told by Narada to Maharaja Pracinabarhi 

              in Chapters 25-9 of the Fourth Canto. In brief, the imaginary Puranjana 

              is equivalent to the Everyman figure in medieval European morality 

              plays. He represents the illusioned soul suffering from misidentification 

              with his temporary embodiment in material life. Puranjana tries 

              for years to enjoy with his consort, the female personification 

              of his material intelligence; he finally succumbs to old age, disease 

              and death, and then, because of too much attachment to his wife, 

              takes his next birth as a woman. This female reincarnation of Puranjana 

              marries a pious king who dies young, leaving his wife bewildered 

              in lamentation. Our text occurs at this point in the narration, 

              as the fifty-first verse of Chapter 28. It describes an unexpected 

              visit by an old, forgotten friend. Here are the original Sanskrit 

              text and Srila Prabhupada's translation: </p>

            <p></p>

            <p align="center" class="maintext"><i>tatra purvatarah kascit <br>

              sakha brahmana atmavan <br>

              santvayan valguna samna <br>

              tam aha rudatim prabho </i></p>

            <p align="center"></p>

            <p class="maintext">'My dear King, one <i>brahmana,</i> who was an 

              old friend of King Puranjana, came to that place and began to pacify 

              the Queen with sweet words.' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Srila Prabhupada's explanation of this verse, 

              his 'purport', fills two pages. It is based on the short commentaries, 

              each only a few lines long, by two standard Vaisnava teachers, Sridhara 

              Svami and Visvanatha Cakravarti. We will first describe these commentaries 

              and then analyse how Srila Prabhupada used them. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">The oldest extant commentary on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 

              </i>was written by Sridhara Svami;<i> </i>older commentaries are 

              known only by name or by isolated fragments. No solid evidence supports 

              his exact lifespan; Karl Potter has tentatively assigned his birth 

              to the beginning of the fifteenth century,[<a href="#2F" class="maintext">2</a>]<a name="2"></a> 

              though Sridhara Svami may have lived earlier than that, since less 

              than a century later Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu described Sridhara 

              as being a venerable authority. In India, more than one century 

              is usually needed for a commentator on traditional literature to 

              become established as an authority. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">As far as is known, Sridhara Svami did not belong 

              to any of the major Vaisnava schools, but was probably an initiated 

              member of Sankara's Advaita [<a href="#3F" class="maintext">3</a>]<a name="3"></a> 

              <i>sampradaya</i>. Nonetheless, the opinions he expressed in his 

              commentaries on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> and the <i>Visnu Purana</i> 

              were staunchly Vaisnava. Caitanya Mahaprabhu's cutting comments 

              to ­Vallabha-acarya, a prominent Vaisnava, testify to the great 

              respect Caitanya had for Sridhara's opinions, as Lord Caitanya's 

              biographer Krsnadasa Kaviraja recounts: </p>

            <blockquote class="maintext"> Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu smilingly replied, 

              'One who does not accept the <i>svami</i> [husband] as an authority 

              I consider a prostitute. ... You have dared criticise Sridhara Svami, 

              and you have begun your own commentary on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i> 

              not accepting his authority. That is your false pride. Sridhara 

              Svami is the spiritual master of the entire world because by his 

              mercy we can understand <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>. I therefore accept 

              him as a spiritual master. Whatever you might write due to false 

              pride, trying to surpass Sridhara Svami, would carry a contrary 

              purport. Therefore no one would pay attention to it. One who comments 

              on <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> following in the footsteps of Sridhara 

              Svami will be honored and accepted by everyone.'[<a href="#4F" class="maintext">4</a>]<a name="4"></a> 

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">The two-sentence commentary of Sridhara Svami 

              on the verse we are considering reads: 'The friend who is "very 

              old" in the sense of being eternal without origin is the Supreme 

              Lord, in accordance with the statement of revealed scripture beginning 

              "Two birds ... " He addressed her with sweet words of consolation.'[<a href="#5F" class="maintext">5</a>]<a name="5"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">In the first sentence, Sridhara Svami identifies 

              old friend of the the queen as every soul's original friend, the 

              supreme controller (<i>isvara</i>). He supports this opinion by 

              proposing that this verse of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> alludes to 

              one of the oldest Vedic hymns. Although it is well known that the 

              verse beginning <i>dva suparna</i> occurs in both the <i>Mundaka 

              </i>and <i>Svetasvatara Upanisads,</i>[<a href="#6F" class="maintext">6</a>]<a name="6"></a>

              in his purport to <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 4.28.51 is the one written 

              by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura in the second half of the seventeenth 

              century. Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti was the most prominent spiritual 

              master of sixth-generation Vaisnavas in Caitanya Mahaprabhu's <i>sampradaya.</i> 

              Srila Visvanatha led the Gaudiya Vaisnava community in Vrndavana 

              during the time of the Mogul Emperor Aurangzeb, who persecuted the 

              Vaisnavas. Visvanatha's own predecessor was the celebrated devotional 

              poet Narottama Dasa, and among his disciples was Baladeva Vidyabhusana, 

              author of the <i>Govinda-bhasya</i> commentary on <i>Vedanta-sutra</i>. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Visvanatha Cakravarti's commentary on this verse 

              is four sentences long. The first sentence suggests a deep meaning 

              to the allegory of Queen Puranjani's lamentation: </p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">[This verse] implies that in such a mood of 

                distress as is suffered when one's spiritual master has departed 

                from this world, a disciple can experience the direct presence 

                of God.[<a href="#8F" class="maintext">8</a>] <a name="8"></a> 

              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">In this realisation of Visvanatha Cakravarti, 

              Everyman has been replaced with a rare, special soul - the surrendered 

              disciple of a pure Vaisnava. Without any other qualifications of 

              his own, a sincere disciple earns the right to see God simply by 

              his attachment to his spiritual master. After the guru has passed 

              away, the serious disciple does not lose his spiritual strength 

              but continues to advance by remembering and executing the guru's 

              instructions. The intense devotional mood of separation can develop 

              into direct vision of the Supreme Person. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Visvanatha Cakravarti's second sentence is an 

              almost exact repeat of Sridhara Svami's first sentence: </p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">In this context, the friend who is 'very old' 

                in the sense of being eternal without origin is the Supreme Lord, 

                in accordance with such statements of revealed scripture as the 

                one beginning 'Two birds....'[<a href="#9F" class="maintext">9</a>]<a name="9"></a>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">In the Sanskrit commentary tradition, this sort 

              of 'plagiarism' is considered ethical. It is appropriate to simply 

              repeat the statements of one's predecessors when further explanation 

              for one's own generation was not required. To pretend to be original, 

              furthermore, is frowned upon. Most of Visvanatha Cakravarti's contemporaries 

              who could read Sanskrit were probably acquainted with Sridhara Svami's 

              commentary and would have recognised this citation; for those who 

              were unfamiliar with Sridhara, Visvanatha was being considerate 

              by passing on the past master's words. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">The third sentence explains why the old friend 

              in the allegory appears as a <i>brahmana:</i> </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">He [the Supreme Lord in the heart] is a <i>brahmana</i>,<i> 

                </i>or in other words, he is in the guise of a <i>brahmana;</i> 

                by this [the present verse] means to inform us that without pure 

                love of God one can never have direct realization of God's true, 

                original form.[<a href="#10F" class="maintext">10</a>]<a name="10"></a>

            <p class="maintext">The sincere disciple represented by Queen Puranjani 

              is not prepared to fully realise God's personality, but even in 

              His disguised form the Lord kindly gives the soul instructions that 

              enable him to gradually achieve perfection. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Visvanatha Cakravarti's fourth sentence explains 

              another word in the verse, the adjective <i>atma-van</i> (literally, 

              'self-possessed' or 'self-realised'), which further characterises 

              the <i>brahmana:</i> 'Self-possessed' here means also having His 

              original form, which He kept hidden within Himself.[<a href="#11F" class="maintext">11</a>]<a name="11"></a></p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Ordinarily, God, who sits silently within every 

              person's heart, limits His functions to being a witness, sanctioner 

              and facilitator of the living being's endeavours. In the case of 

              the rare soul who has become purified from material desires, God 

              advises the soul directly from within the heart how to progress 

              toward liberation. Besides being the Supersoul, however, He is simultaneously 

              nondifferent from God in His full personal form. Those who progress 

              beyond liberation to pure devotion thus realise their own personal 

              relationship with God. </p>

            <p class="maintext">Now we can look at Srila Prabhupada's purport. 

              He begins by retelling Visvanatha Cakravarti's second sentence, 

              which, as we have seen, is Sridhara Svami's first sentence and refers 

              back to the <i>Upanisads </i>and the <i>Rg Veda</i>. Visvanatha 

              Cakravarti had said:<b> </b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">The appearance of an old friend in the form 

                of a <i>brahmana</i> is very significant. In His ­Paramatma feature, 

                Krsna is the old friend of everyone. According to Vedic injunction, 

                Krsna is sitting with the living entity side by side. According 

                to the <i>sruti-mantra</i> (<i>dva suparna sayuja sakhayah</i>), 

                the Lord is sitting within the heart of every living entity as 

                <i>suhrt,</i> the best friend. The Lord is always eager to have 

                the living entity come home, back to Godhead. Sitting with the 

                living entity as witness, the Lord gives him all chances to enjoy 

                himself materially, but whenever there is an opportunity, the 

                Lord gives good counsel and advises the living entity to abandon 

                trying to become happy through material adjustment and instead 

                turn his face toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender 

                unto Him. </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Srila Prabhupada next presents the idea of Visvanatha 

              Cakravarti's first sentence, which reads: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">[This verse] implies that in such a mood of

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">From this, Srila Prabhupada's derives the following: 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p class="maintext">When one becomes serious to follow the mission 

                of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing 

                the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained before, this 

                means meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the instruction 

                of the spiritual master. This is technically called <i>vani-seva.</i> 

              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">In Sanskrit the word <i>vani </i>means 'the faculty 

              of speech', 'words', and 'instructions'. <i>Seva</i> means 'service'. 

              A disciple can serve his spiritual master's body (<i>vapuh</i>) 

              whenever opportunities arise, but more important is serving his 

              <i>vani</i>. <i>Vani-seva</i> is not limited by the absence of the 

              person being served.<i> </i>Srila Prabhupada continues in his purport:

                  serve the words of the spiritual master. The disciple must stick

              any number of disciples and scholars. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Srila Prabhupada was firmly convinced of the relevance 

              of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>. In his view, the <i>Bhagavatam's</i> 

              teachings were timeless, the perennial science of God consciousness. 

              His own responsibility was simply to translate them without distortion. 

              If the instructions of his authoritative predecessors were properly 

              served, the whole world would surely benefit. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p class="maintext">Admittedly, the ideas and images Srila Prabhupada 

              strove to convey in his purports are sometimes difficult for modern 

              readers to comprehend, what to speak of assimilate. The original 

              texts he translated are messages from a different world, ancient 

              and foreign. But ­Prabhupada felt the urgent need to deliver these 

              messages as best he could. He was thus always concerned with how 

              to make the <i>Bhagavatam's </i>enlightening instructions comprehensible 

              to the average, contemporary public. Certainly not everyone would 

              understand, but even if only a few readers received benefit from 

              this transcendental knowledge, the endeavour could be counted as 

              a great success. Before Srila Prabhupada came to America in 1965 

              with his first English volumes of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i> a well-intentioned 

              person could have questioned him, 'Why present this work, which 

              has a very small audience? Why not something else, easier and more 

              popular?' Prabhupada, however, did not think in such a way. To him 

              it did not matter that there were no readers for <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam; 

              </i>he created his own readership. In a few years, thousands of 

              disciples became serious students of the ­<i>Bhagavatam,</i> and 

              millions of other people around the world brought the book into 

              their homes. This is the sign of a great author - that he creates 

              an audience where there was none. </p>

              Sri Jiva Goswami (<i>Tattva-sandarbha</i> 27) writes about Sridhara 

              Svami's association with the Advaita school:<i> samprati madhya-desadau 

              vyaptan advaita-vadino nunam bhagavan-mahimanam avagahayitum tad-vadena

              cet tarhi yathavad eva vilikhyate.</i> 'Srila Sridhara Svami is 

              a perfect Vaisnava. But to entice the Advaita-vadis - nowadays prominent 

              all over Madhya-desa and other parts of the country - to become 

              absorbed in the glories of the Supreme Lord, he mixed some traces 

              of their theories into his writings.' </p>
