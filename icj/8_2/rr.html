            <span class="maintextsubhead"> Author: Klaus K. Klostermaier <br>

            Publisher: Oneworld, Oxford, 2000 <br>

            ISBN: 1-85168-213-9 (paperback) </span> 

            <p><span class="maintextsubhead"><i></i></span><i>Hinduism: A Short 

              History</i> is the second in a series of introductory texts on Hinduism 

              published by Oneworld. The other books in the series - <i>Hinduism: 

              A Short Introduction, Hindu Writings: A Short Introduction to the 

              Major Sources, </i>and <i>A Concise Encyclopaedia of ­Hinduism</i> 

              - were also written by Klaus K. Klostermaier, University Distinguished 

              Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University 

              of Manitoba in Canada. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Klostermaier's straightforward writing style and ability to make 

              specialised topics accessible to a general audience have made him 

              a favourite author in the field of Hindu studies. His full-length 

              study of Hinduism, <i>A Survey of Hinduism</i> (SUNY Press), has 

              been praised in academic and popular circles alike. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><i>Hinduism: A Short History</i> continues in the same vein, using 

              a similar format to the author's other introductory texts. Instead 

              of dividing Hindu history into periods, Klostermaier arranges it 

              thematically, tracing the parallel histories of the major sub-traditions. 

              He devotes individual chapters to the histories of early Vedic religion, 

              Vaisnavism, Saivism, Saktism, Hindu philosophy, and modern Hinduism. 

              This approach has several advantages. First, by focusing on one 

              tradition at a time, he reduces the confusion that often arises 

              from the ­complex, intertwining nature of Hinduism, allowing the 

              reader to grasp the most immediate influences on a particular tradition. 

              Second, because the histories of all these traditions are interrelated, 

              the chapters often overlap in their coverage. This repetition puts 

              the material in a new light by applying it in different contexts. 

              For example, in describing the four Vedas in each chapter, the author 

              shows how the same texts have been used for different purposes by 

              the various traditions. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>But perhaps the most important reason for a thematic presentation 

              of Hindu history is that a convincing periodisation has been extremely 

              difficult to achieve, especially for ancient Hinduism. Klostermaier 

              begins his book by discussing the problems associated with any history 

              of Hinduism, and then devotes an entire chapter to the Aryan beginnings 

              of Hinduism. This earliest period of Hindu history is currently 

              the subject of heated debate, with one side supporting the Aryan 

              invasion theory and the other arguing for the native origins of 

              Vedic civilisation. Both sides have often been motivated by interests 

              other than purely academic ones; nevertheless, the controversy lies 

              at the heart of a serious historical problem. Klostermaier wishes 

              to provide 'the arguments pro and con', leaving it to us to 'judge 

              the merits of the case', but he makes no attempt to hide his opinion 

              on the matter. He opens the chapter by saying that 'the so-called 

              Aryan invasion theory is based on pure speculation, and that there 

              is absolutely no archaeological or literary evidence for it' (p. 

              34) and ends the chapter by asserting that 'there is no doubt that 

              the "old chronology" has been discredited ... ' (p. 45). <i>Hinduism: 

              A Short History</i> is notable in that it is one of few textbooks 

              by Western scholars that argue against the invasion theory. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>For readers of this journal, the author's coverage of Vaisnavism 

              will be of special interest. Besides the one chapter devoted exclusively 

              to Vaisnavism, Vaisnava topics appear throughout the text. Overall, 

              the presentation is sympathetic, accurate, and appealing. The section 

              on Vaisnava worship and devotion, which includes a description of 

              the different kinds of Visnu <i>murtis </i>found in temples, is 

              especially useful. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Gaudiya Vaisnavism, and ISKCON in particular, command a strong 

              presence in the book, with ISKCON being discussed perhaps more than 

              any other modern Hindu organisation. Numerous references to the 

              Hare Krsna movement are made throughout the text, and the Gaudiya 

              perspective is offered on many issues of concern to Vaisnavas. In 

              the chapter on Vaisnavism, an entire subsection is devoted to the 

              philosophy and practice of the Gaudiya <i>sampradaya</i>. The author 

              describes Sri Caitanya as 'one of the most influential figures in 

              modern Vaisnavism' (p. 114), and Gaudiya Vaisnavism as 'a vigorous 

              movement and a major presence in the Hindu religious scene' (p. 

              118). In the chapter on modern Hinduism, ISKCON and its founder, 

              Srila Prabhupada, receive relatively substantial coverage. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Klostermaier describes the Hare Krsna movement as 'the most genuinely 

              Hindu of all the many Indian movements in the West' - a significant 

              statement considering the public perception of the movement in the 

              past. In the chapter on the history of two holy cities, Mathura 

              and Varanasi, Klostermaier mentions 'the large and beautiful Krishna-Balaram 

              Mandir' as one of the major attractions of Vrndavana (p. 25). </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Why does Gaudiya Vaisnavism receive this kind of attention? The 

              author gives us hints in a couple of places. For one, the Caitanya 

              movement 'has become known and influential in the West as the "Hare 

              Krsna Movement" and so some more detailed information on this branch 

              of Vaisnavism might be welcomed by Western readers' (p. 114). The 

              second, perhaps more subtle reason, is that Western scholarship 

              is increasingly turning toward Vaisnavism, after having for a long 

              time focused on Sankara and his school. Part of this scholarship 

              is generated by the members of ISKCON who are systematically exploring 

              the rich scholarly heritage of Gaudiya Vaisnavism. In numerous references 

              in this chapter recent Western scholarship has been indicated: in 

              the past few decades many translations of Vaisnava texts have appeared, 

              as well as numerous monographs on Vaisnava history and theology, 

              and several conferences were held dealing with <i>bhakti </i>movements. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The most obvious, often annoying, drawback of the work is the lack 

              of meticulous proofreading. Typographical errors and minor factual 

              mistakes abound. For example, in the chapter on modern Hinduism, 

              Srila Prabhupada is introduced as 'Swami Bhaktivedanta ­Sarasvati', 

              and his dates are given as 1896-1973. The Six Goswamis of Vrndavana 

              are introduced as 'Rupa Goswami, Jiva Goswami and the younger Sanatana 

              Goswami'. The book is especially prone to errors with regard to 

              Sanskrit diacritic marks, even in the glossary. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Minor errors aside, <i>Hinduism: A Short History</i> is an excellent 

              introduction to a vast subject and should be immensely useful to 

              students and teachers of Hinduism. More experienced readers will 

              find the endnotes, bibliography, and numerous references to scholarly 

              literature helpful for further study. The work is another example 

              of the author's skill in distilling large amounts of material to 

              obtain what is most relevant and interesting to his audience. &nbsp;
