            </a><i>Do different interpretations of a common scripture necessitate 

            schism within a tradition? To what extent do these differences of 

            interpretation really matter to the practitioner? Can the pursuit 

            of philosophical detail obscure the message of the wider philosophy? 

            In this article Prof. Narasimhachary examines the division of the 

            Srivaisnava tradition into different schools according to their interpretation 

            of scripture. He considers to what extent such division can be avoided 

            by allowing that each side of a philosophical argument has its merits. 

            Are there lessons for ISKCON in this topic?</i> 

            <p></p>

            Interpretation (<i>vyakhyana</i>) based on proper methodology and 

            backed by analytical skills is undoubtedly a means of arriving at 

            truth. All religious and philosophical systems, theological or otherwise, 

            invariably depend upon interpretation for their own stability and 

            credibility. Sri Sankara, the celebrated exponent of Advaita, states 

            that logic is welcome in understanding scripture so long as it does 

            not transgress its own limits.[<a href="#1f">1</a>]<a name="1"></a> 

            In other words, logical and interpretational skills, however useful 

            they may otherwise be, cannot and should not be allowed to function 

            independently. Logic has its own soundness and its own position in 

            the scheme of epistemology, but beyond a reasonable state it tends 

            to become cumbersome and unacceptable. That is precisely why the Vedantins 

            do not accept the claim of the Tarkikas that the syllogistic method 

            of logic can establish the existence of God. For them, it is only 

            the Scripture (<i>sruti</i>) that can prove this beyond any speck 

            of doubt. Badarayana, the celebrated author of the <i>Brahma-sutra</i>, 

            has stated the same truth in the aphorism '<i>tarkapratisthanadapi 

            ...&nbsp;</i>'(<i>Brahma-sutra </i>2.1.2). 

            <p></p>

            We find in the <i>Rg Veda</i> polytheism, monotheism, monism and a 

            host of other concepts existing side by side. Western scholars, wishing 

            to find a developmental pattern in the profusion of concepts, consider 

            that hymns showing monotheistic tendencies occur later than hymns 

            showing polytheistic tendencies because this accords with their own 

            theory of the development of ideas from many to one, monotheism being 

            higher than polytheism. (Bowes, p. 201) But Hindus do not believe 

            in this, for in their tradition, these two are not opposites - they 

            are not mutually exclusive, nor is monotheism necessarily better than 

            polytheism, as each represents a different attitude toward the same 

            reality. They can occur together at the same time and can continue 

            to exist together. Yajnavalkya in the <i>Brhadaranyaka Upanisad</i> 

            was asked how many gods there were. He gave at the same time the following 

            numbers: 3003, 303, 33, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1½ and 1. The question could therefore 

            be answered in all these ways at the same time, not over a time sequence 

            during which man's ideas about God developed from 3003 to 1. (Bowes, 

            p. 201) 

            <p></p>

            Hindus, being inclined toward the universal, are predisposed to see 

            what is common among things, while the Western intellectual, inclined 

            toward the particular, is predisposed to see what is different; when 

            different things are said to be the same, the Western intellectual 

            takes this as a sign of total lack of critical ability.<b> </b>To 

            the Hindu mind, the ultimate in its timeless dimension is beyond characterisation, 

            and so far as its temporal manifestation is concerned, it is not confined 

            to any particular personage or happening. (Bowes, p. 101) 

            <p></p>

            The value of interpretation cannot be underestimated in understanding 

            the subtleties of a given system of thought. For example, the <i>Brahma-sutra</i>, 

            which comprises about five hundred and forty-five aphorisms, has been 

            interpreted by almost all the philosopher-­preceptors of India in 

            totally different ways. Thus we have the commentaries of Sankara (Advaita), 

            Bhaskara (Bhedabheda), Yadavaprakasa (another kind of Bhedabheda), 

            ­Nimbarka ­(Dvaitadvaita), Ramanuja (Visistadvaita), Madhva (Dvaita), 

            Vallabha (Suddhadvaita) and Sri Krsna Caitanya (Acintya Bhedabheda 

            as interpreted by Baladeva Vidyabhusana) and so on. This list, of 

            course, does not include many earlier writers such as Guhadeva, Kapardin, 

            Bharuci, Bhartrmitra, Bhartrprapanca and others. How could so many 

            interpretations be given to a single text as the <i>Brahma-sutra</i>? 

            Yamuna asks: '<i>kim asya sutrasya</i> <i>hrdayam</i>?'[<a href="#2f">2</a>] 

            <a name="2"></a>(What exactly is the 'heart' or import of this aphorism?) 

            Badarayana himself records the views of philosophers like ssmarathya, 

            Audulomin and Kasakrtsna regarding the nature of God and man in his 

            <i>Brahma-sutra</i> (1.4.20-2). What of a simple text like the <i>Gita</i>? 

            How many <i>acaryas</i> have not interpreted it in the light of their 

            own philosophical tradition. What can a layman who has no expertise 

            in interpreting the scriptures do? He has to follow one particular 

            preceptor, stick to one particular tradition and try to understand 

            the truth. There is no other way. There is, of course, the danger 

            of the wrong people giving the wrong interpretations to texts to make 

            gullible people believe their own doctrine to be right and all others 

            wrong. 

            <p></p>

            With this background, let me now demonstrate how textual interpretation 

            has led to endless debates and dialogues, claims and counterclaims, 

            in a single tradition, viz., the Srisampradaya of Sri Ramanuja (1017-1137 

            AD). There are two important and powerful post-Ramanuja Srivaisnava 

            sects in Tamil Nadu (South India) called the 'Tenkalai' (Southern) 

            and the 'Vadakalai' (Northern) which govern almost all the activities 

            of a Srivaisnava living there. The heads of these two sects are known 

            as Pillai Lokacarya and Venkatanatha (popularly known as Vedanta Desika), 

            respectively. They were contemporaries who lived in the thirteenth 

            century. Although they were on friendly terms during their lifetime, 

            their followers in succeeding centuries became bitter critics of each 

            other's tradition. Through study and research, scholars have identified 

            eighteen doctrinal differences in the writings of these two stalwarts.[<a href="#3f">3</a>] 

            <a name="3"></a>Separate works were written highlighting these differences. 

            (Gupta, p. 93) For an impartial observer, however, the acrimonious 

            debates and criticisms that are extending even now are out of place 

            and unwarranted since, after all, they both represent the same <i>sampradaya</i> 

            of Ramanuja. What we now have is the small Srivaisnava community raising 

            narrow domestic walls that are, in fact, doing great injustice to 

            the spirit of Ramanuja, who strove all his life to bring harmony (<i>samanvaya</i>) 

            among several sections of society. 

            <p></p>

            Let us now take up a few of these eighteen doctrinal differences many 

            of which are of pure academic interest and which, for some, make no 

            sense at all. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Doctrinal differences in Srivaisnavism </b> 

            <p></p>

            <i>(1) The nature of God's grace </i> 

            <p></p>

            According to the Southern sect, God's grace is voluntary and unstrained. 

            It comes to a person without being sought. It comes to a person even 

            if he or she is unwilling to welcome it. But one has to remain 'passive'. 

            The analogy is that of a mother cat and her kitten, called the <i>marjarakisora-nyaya</i>. 

            The kitten does not do anything to be taken by its mother from place 

            to place. The mother grabs the kitten by its neck and takes it to 

            different places. Likewise, a devotee will also be taken care of by 

            God even if there is no conscious effort on the part of the former. 

            <p></p>

            According to the Northern sect, God will not help a person unless 

            he does his little bit to deserve or earn His grace. The analogy is 

            that of a mother monkey and her young one, called the <i>markata-kisora-nyaya</i>. 

            The mother monkey hops from one tree to another while her baby clings 

            tightly to her. Unless the baby monkey does its own part, the mother 

            will not bother to protect it. 

            <p></p>

            Now let us see how interpretation plays its own role here. For an 

            impartial seeker after truth, both these viewpoints appear reasonably 

            sound. It is true that one has to do his bit of work to earn the grace 

            of God, otherwise the world becomes an asylum of lazy people. Once 

            a devotee went to a spiritual master who could perform miracles and 

            asked him: 'Svamin! I am very poor. I want to become a millionaire 

            through the lottery. Kindly bless me so that I will be the lucky winner.' 

            The Svami said: 'All right. Have you bought a lottery ticket?' 'No, 

            I have not bought one,' replied the devotee. The Svami said, smiling: 

            'See, you have not done the minimum expected of you. What can I do?' 

            <p></p>

            The message is clear. According to even the Southern sect, when the 

            mother cat takes the kitten in her mouth, a kind of co-operation on 

            the part of the kitten is required. If the kitten refuses to be taken 

            by its mother, what can the poor mother do? Or, to put it a different 

            way, if a devotee can remain as helpless, innocent and passive as 

            the kitten, then God will take personal care of that devotee. Remaining 

            in such an utter passive and helpless state, totally believing in 

            the saving grace of God, is indeed the most important characteristic 

            of a genuine <i>prapanna</i>. To be a <i>prapanna </i>means to have 

            unassailable faith (<i>mahavisvasa</i>) in the saviourship of God. 

            Having such a faith is in itself active involvement, however unconscious 

            it may be, on the part of the devotee. An act is an act, whether one 

            is aware of it or not. What is important is that the devotee has trust 

            in God, which serves the purpose. 

            <p></p>

            <i>(2) The position of Sri </i> 

            <p></p>

            Another issue on which debates have been continuing unabated among 

            the Srivaisnavas of South India is whether Sri (Laksmi), who is the 

            mother of the creation and the inseparable Consort of Lord Visnu, 

            forms part of the category of the living beings (<i>jivakoti</i>) 

            or is of the category of the Lord Himself (<i>isvarakoti</i>). For 

            the Southern sect, She belongs to the category of the individual souls, 

            although She is superior to them by virtue of the special status conferred 

            upon Her by the Lord by taking Her as His wife and thereby making 

            Her the Mistress of the Universe. She is 'anu' (atomic), like the 

            jivas themselves. By virtue of Her special status, She shares with 

            God all His glories, such as the eternal abode (Vaikuntha), where 

            She is attended by liberated souls like Ananta and Garuda. 

            <p></p>

            However, the Northern sect believes that Sri is not a jiva. She belongs 

            to the category of the Lord Himself (<i>isvarakoti</i>) and is coeval 

            with Him in all aspects. She is all-pervasive (<i>vibhu</i>) and all-powerful 

            like Him. If He can confer liberation, so too can She, although She 

            never uses that power. Like the Lord, She is also capable of punishing 

            the wicked and evil-minded. However, being the mother benign, She 

            does not take that extreme step. The expression <i>ivarim sarvabhutanam</i> 

            (<i>Srisukta</i>) is taken in the literal sense, by which She is stated 

            to be the ruler of the universe. Can there be two rulers for a single 

            universe? The interpretation is that, although Laksmi can rule over 

            the world Herself, on the analogy of the <i>laukikadampati </i>(a 

            couple living in this world), with a perfect understanding with the 

            Lord, Her Husband, She prefers to have Him rule over the world. By 

            mutual agreement and identity of thought, the couple exert helpful 

            influence and rule over the universe. 

            <p></p>

            Whatever the doctrinal differences are, both the Southern and Northern 

            sects accept Laksmi as the mother of all the creatures and that She 

            mediates between the Lord, who is the strict disciplinarian, on the 

            one hand and the erring human on the other. In this role she is technically 

            called the <i>Purusakara</i>. For a layperson, it matters little whether 

            Laksmi is as pervasive as the Lord Himself or is only an individual 

            soul raised to the level of Supremacy. 

            <p></p>

            <i>(3) God's pervasion of the souls, which are atomic in size (anuvyapti) 

            </i> 

            <p></p>

            According to the Southern sect, God has infinite powers and can therefore 

            literally enter into the atomic souls. Since He is all-pervasive (vibhu), 

            He can be present simultaneously in every particle of matter. Thus 

            His presence in the souls is a real and indwelling pervasion. 

            <p></p>

            However, according to the Northern sect, God, being infinite, cannot 

            pervade or penetrate into the atomic souls. His infinite magnitude 

            does not allow Him to dwell within the atomic soul. He pervades the 

            <i>jivatmans</i> from outside and not from inside. His presence in 

            souls is to be understood as co-existence, but not pervasion. (Srinivasachari, 

            p. 535) 

            <p></p>

            This point is also of academic interest. The Tengalai view is based 

            on the scriptural statement: <i>antar bahisca tat sarvan vyapya narayanah 

            sthitah</i> (<i>Narayananuvaka</i>) ('Narayana pervades everything 

            in the universe from within and without'.) However, the view held 

            by the Vadagalais is based purely on the question of possibility. 

            Once we have committed ourselves to the <i>vyapitva</i> (all pervasiveness) 

            of the Lord, it must be taken in its fullest sense of possibility. 

            We should not compromise with any kind of diminution on the part of 

            the Lord's <i>svarupa</i>. Further, if the <i>svarupa</i> of the individual 

            soul is really atomic (<i>anu</i>), then it cannot and should not 

            have any room for the presence of any entity there, including that 

            of the Lord. However, one should not jump to the conclusion that the 

            Northern sect does not accept the immanence of the Lord; it does. 

            The Southern sect postulates an indwelling immanence, the Northern 

            sect a co-dwelling immanence. The former states that God dwells <i>in 

            </i>matter and souls; the latter, that He dwells <i>on </i>matter 

            and souls. 

            <p></p>

            <i>(4) Nature of God's parental love (vatsalya) </i> 

            <p></p>

            Differences arise between the two sects as to the nature of God's 

            <i>vatsalya</i> (the love that a parent has for a child). The Southern 

            school believes that God's love for His children is so wonderful that 

            He not only winks at their faults but also actually enjoys them. The 

            dirtier the child is, the dearer he becomes to the doting mother. 

            It is to the sinners and erring beings that God can pour out His love 

            and grace in full and render real help. A highly meritorious person 

            will automatically become acceptable to the Lord. But what glory is 

            there in such acceptability? Just as a poor man alone is in real need 

            of money and a sick person alone requires medicine, only one who is 

            utterly worthless and defective requires God's love and help. Yamuna 

            in his <i>Stotraratna</i> (v. 51) says: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center">

            <blockquote> 

              <div align="left">O Lord! Therefore it all means this: Without you 

                I am utterly without a master. Without me, you will not have a

                about by Fate. Kindly honour it. Don't break it. </div>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            This particular taste that the erring human invokes or generates in 

            the Lord is called <i>dosabhogyatva</i>. 

            <p></p>

            The Northern school, however, argues that this is a horrible doctrine 

            because it encourages one who is already a sinner to become a horrendous 

            criminal since he would then become more acceptable to God. But God, 

            being a strict disciplinarian, will not ignore the sins and faults 

            of the living beings. He is the <i>dharmadhyaksa </i>(the one who 

            supervises and ensures the proper function of the Law of Justice without 

            any fear or favour). Does He not declare in the <i>Gita</i> that He 

            is equanimous towards all the living beings and that there is none 

            who is either detestable or dear to Him?[<a href="#4f">4</a>] <a name="4"></a>The 

            <i>Brahma-sutra</i> (2.1.34) also states the same truth: <i>vaisamya-nairghrnye 

            na sapeksatvat</i> (The Lord is neither partial to some nor cruel 

            to others. The suffering of the living beings is dependent [on their 

            past acts].) Ignoring the faults and sins of living beings means ignoring 

            moral values and sacrificing justice and truth. According to this 

            school, the Lord may be said to wink at the faults of the devotee 

            (<i>dosadarsitva</i>). He may be said to pardon the sins of the devotee. 

            This implies that the Lord takes note of the sins but will not punish 

            them as a consequence. The concept of non-observance of the sins exalts 

            the uniqueness of God's love more than the doctrine of pardon without 

            at the same time discounting moral values or making sin respectful 

            and acceptable. 

            <p></p>

            So is there any controversy in this matter? Seemingly yes, but really 

            no. The defects of the devotee will be enjoyable to the Lord provided 

            the devotee is genuine, believing in none but the Lord as his saviour, 

            father and mother. In his childlike innocence, even if a mistake or 

            two is committed, the Lord would not mind. He feels happy that the 

            mistakes really speak about the absolute abandon of the devotee. The 

            devotee is in such a state of total absorption that he is unaware 

            of the mistakes committed, and with that free and innocent state of 

            mind, he approaches God. But the real position is that such a devotee 

            will not normally go wrong. If a mistake or two should creep in, he 

            will atone for them in the prescribed way. So even on this issue there 

            need be no controversy. In fact, the following verse from Vedanta 

            Desika's <i>Dayasataka </i>(v. 97) seems to come closer to the view 

            of the Southern school: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>autsukhyapurvamupahrtya mahaparadhan<br>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> Mother Daya! My mind, with great enthusiasm, wishes to

              licked clean all of them without any leftovers, You are not satiated 

              at all. What a wonder! </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <i>(5) Nature of God's mercy (daya) </i> 

            <p></p>

            According to the Southern school, God, out of His unbounded compassion, 

            actually suffers whenever His devotees suffer (<i>paraduhkha-duhkhitvam</i>). 

            This should not, however, be construed as a defect or imperfection. 

            He shares in their sufferings even as He participates in their happiness. 

            This only indicates His infinite compassion. Rama, as Valmiki depicts, 

            used to suffer greatly when his subjects were in difficulties. When 

            they had occasion to be happy, he would join them and celebrate the 

            event like their father. 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>vyasanesu manusyanam bhrsam bhavati duhkhitah 

              <br>

              utsavesu ca sarvesu piteva paritusyati </i> </div>

            <p align="center"></p>

            So suffering on the part of God when His children suffer is not a 

            blot on the nature of God. Rather, it enhances His quality of compassion. 

            However, the Northern school contends that although God will show 

            His compassion to living beings when they suffer, He Himself will 

            not suffer. He is perfect in all respects and is an abode of innumerable 

            auspicious qualities. Suffering is a defect, and it cannot be presumed 

            to be present in Him. How then should one explain the <i>Ramayana</i> 

            verse quoted above? It can only mean that Rama did all in his power 

            to alleviate the suffering of His people. Further, since Rama was 

            behaving as an ordinary mortal, he may have enacted suffering along 

            with His subjects. Being the Supreme Being, He is really above all 

            misery and suffering. 

            <p></p>

            Again, this is a point of academic interest that can be interpreted 

            and understood in ways acceptable to both schools of thought. God 

            in his human form may appear to have suffered, but in His supreme 

            state He is always blissful, detached from everyone. The following 

            verse from the <i>Brahmanda Purana</i> reveals the true nature of 

            the Lord: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>jnanam apratigham tasya vairagyam ca jajatpateh</i><i><br>

              aisvaryam caiva dharmasca sahasiddham catustayam </i> </div>

            <p align="center"></p>

            <blockquote>Unimpeded knowledge, detachment, absolute suzerainty and 

              righteousness are the four natural traits of the Lord of the Universe. 

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <i>(6) Nature of the means of liberation </i> 

            <p></p>

            According to the followers of Vedanta Desika, all three yogas mentioned 

            in the <i>Gita -</i> <i>karma </i>(work), <i>jnana </i>(knowledge), 

            and <i>bhakti </i>(devotion) have their own role in effecting salvation. 

            Of these, <i>bhakti</i> is the direct means of liberation; the others 

            are indirect. <i>Karma </i>leads to <i>jnana</i>, <i>jnana</i> to 

            <i>bhakti</i> and <i>bhakti</i> to <i>prapatti </i>(surrender). Salvation 

            is mainly the result of self-effort. 

            <p></p>

            The followers of Pillai Lokacarya hold that <i>karma</i>, <i>jnana</i> 

            and <i>bhakti </i>have no value compared to <i>prapatti</i> yoga, 

            since the Lord Himself declared so in the <i>caramasloka </i>(­<i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

            18.66) 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>sarva-dharman parityajya</i><i><br>

              mam ekam saranam vraja <br>

              aham tvam sarva-papebhyo<br>

              moksayisyami ma sucah </i> </div>

            <p align="center"></p>

            Renounce all <i>dharmas</i> and seek refuge in me alone. I shall set 

            you free from all sins; grieve not. 

            <p></p>

            Once more, this is a point of interpretation. The word <i>sarva-dharman 

            </i>is taken literally by the Southern sect. According to this view, 

            all other yogas should be completely abandoned. Further, this school 

            contends that the path of <i>bhakti</i> is very difficult to follow. 

            One in thousands may be successful in <i>bhakti</i> yoga, which has 

            to be performed repeatedly. In contrast, ­<i>prapatti </i>need only 

            be done once, and is considered to be the easiest of all the yoga 

            disciplines, including <i>bhakti</i>. Therefore, whatever is the easiest 

            is also the best and only way open to ordinary people. It is, more 

            or less, the only way for salvation, the essence of <i>prapatti</i> 

            being the abandonment of self-effort. 

            <p></p>

            Although the Northern school admits that <i>prapatti</i> looks comparatively 

            easier than <i>bhakti</i>, they hold that it is even more difficult 

            than <i>bhakti</i> to practice. The main auxiliary of <i>prapatti</i> 

            is <i>mahavisvasa </i>(unassailable faith in the saviourship of God). 

            If this particular <i>anga </i>is wanting, then <i>prapatti</i> becomes 

            diluted and will not attain the desired end. The illustration cited 

            is that of the <i>brahmastra </i>used by Ravana's son Indrajit to 

            arrest Hanuman as he was destroying the prestigious Asoka garden and 

            the city of Lanka. Hanuman was actually arrested by that powerful 

            weapon. However, Indrajit had a lurking doubt in his mind as to whether 

            the weapon really had any power against the formidable monkey. The 

            moment this doubt arose, the <i>brahmastra</i> lost its control over 

            Hanuman. Added to this, Indrajit had brought other materials such 

            as ropes and chains to bind Hanuman, which made the ­<i>brahmastra</i> 

            virtually powerless. Such will be the case if <i>mahavisvasa </i>is 

            lacking in a person who is undertaking <i>prapatti</i>. 

            <p></p>

            When we examine both these views, we see that both are right in their 

            own way. It is true that <i>bhakti</i> is more difficult than <i>prapatti</i> 

            because of the problems involved; <i>bhakti</i> needs repeated practice. 

            The <i>Brahma-sutra</i> says that one-pointed meditation, which is 

            <i>bhakti</i> according to Ramanuja, has to be practised as long as 

            a person lives in this world (Cf. 4.1.12: <i>a prayanat tatrapi hi 

            drstam</i>). The aphorism <i>avrttir</i> <i>asakrdupadesat</i> (<i>Brahma-sutra</i> 

            4.1.1) also stresses the same point. However, <i>prapatti</i> is equally 

            difficult. In the absence of <i>mahavisvasa, </i>it becomes a wasted 

            exercise. Likewise, the seeker of <i>prapatti</i> must employ some 

            self-effort, however small, in order to attain <i>prapatti</i>. However, 

            if the seeker is aware that he or she is making this effort, then 

            it will entail egotism and a sense of independence, which are against 

            the nature of the individual soul. Therefore, the satisfactory solution 

            to this problem is that one should eschew even the idea of self-effort, 

            while at the same time effort should be maintained. 

            <p></p>

            <i>(8) The cause of prapatti</i> 

            <p></p>

            Another point of difference between the Northern and Southern schools 

            is the factor that forms the cause of <i>prapatti</i>. According to 

            the Northern sect, acts of merit performed by living beings in the 

            previous birth are the cause of <i>prapatti</i>, not the mere performance 

            of <i>prapatti</i> in this life. However, the Southern school believes 

            that God's free and spontaneous grace alone is the cause of <i>prapatti</i>. 

            <p></p>

            Here again, the difference of opinion between these two sects is not 

            so serious. The Lord's grace alone is the cause of <i>prapatti</i>, 

            but the present life of a person is an extension and continuation 

            of his or her previous births. Ramanuja, while explaining the scripture 

            <i>yamevaisa vrnute tena labhyah</i> (<i>Mundaka</i> <i>Upanisad</i> 

            3.2.3), states that God loves a man because the man loves Him. It 

            is mutual and reciprocal. This means that the good done by a man in 

            his previous birth makes him virtuous and a devotee in his next life. 

            This naturally earns the grace of the Lord. Thus the arguments of 

            both sects find a common ground. 

            <p></p>

            <i>(9) Abandonment of dharma </i> 

            <p></p>

            The <i>caramasloka </i>(<i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 18.66), beginning with 

            <i>sarva-dharman partityajya</i>, has been interpreted differently 

            by these two schools. According to the Northern school, abandonment 

            of the <i>dharmas</i> does not mean giving up all the duties ordained 

            in the <i>karma-kanda</i> portion of the <i>Vedas</i>. It means abandoning 

            the desire for the fruits of those actions and abandoning the idea 

            that those deeds can yield fruits independent of the grace of God. 

            Even one who surrenders to the Lord (<i>prapanna</i>) cannot therefore 

            abandon the duties enjoined by the scriptures, since they are the 

            commandments of God. So says the Lord Himself: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>srutismrti mamaivajne yastamullanghya vartate</i><i><br>

              ajnacchedi mama drohi madbhakto 'pi na vaisnavah </i> </div>

            <p align="center"></p>

            The <i>srutis </i>and the <i>smrtis </i>constitute My own command. 

            He who violates them will be going against My commandment. I consider 

            him as a traitor against Me. Although he may call Himself My devotee, 

            he is not a Vaisnava. (<i>Visnudharma</i> 76.31) 

            <p></p>

            The Southern school contends that since the Lord Himself asked Arjuna 

            to give up all <i>dharmas</i> and surrender to Him, it is imperative 

            that a <i>prapanna</i> be exempt from doing any kind of <i>dharma</i>. 

            The word <i>sarva-dharman</i> as it appears in the <i>caramasloka 

            </i>must therefore be taken in its full force and significance. They 

            cite the example of Draupadi in support of this conclusion. As long 

            as Draupadi tried to defend herself while being disrobed by Duhsasana 

            in the open court, Lord Krsna did not interfere. But as soon as she 

            threw up her hands in despair, gave up all effort (<i>dharma</i>) 

            and made the following appeal, He sprang into action: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>sankhacaragadapane! dvarakanilayacyuta!</i><i><br>

              govinda pundarikaksa! raksa mam saranagatam </i> </div>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>O wielder of the conch, discus and club! O denizen of Dvaraka! 

                O unfailing One! Govinda! Lotus-eyed One! Save me as I have surrendered 

                to you![<a href="#5f">5</a>] <a name="5"></a> </p>

            </blockquote>

            Likewise, the story of the Elephant King (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>,<i> 

            </i>Eighth Canto) is a saga of the efficacy of wholehearted surrender. 

            As long as the elephant was fighting with the crocodile for survival, 

            he did not succeed. The moment he gave up all effort (<i>sarva-dharma</i>) 

            and surrendered to the Lord wholeheartedly, He appeared on the scene. 

            Therefore, <i>sarvadharma-parityaga</i> is the essence of <i>prapatti</i>. 

            <p></p>

            <p>Both these views can be justified. The Northern sect's belief that 

              one has to perform one's ordained duties is quite sustainable. For 

              example, the <i>nitya</i> and <i>naimittika-karmas</i>, such as 

              performing the <i>sandhya </i>and rituals for the departed manes 

              (<i>sraddha</i>), should never be given up even by a <i>prapanna</i>. 

              Cf, <i>deva-pitr-karyabhyam na pramaditavya</i> (<i>Siksavalli</i>). 

              It is said that Sri Ramanuja, who lived to the ripe old age of one 

              hundred and twenty, used to stand up with great difficulty and offer 

              <i>sandhyavandhana</i> every day. The view of the Southern school 

              that a <i>prapanna</i> should not do any other ritual can also be 

              conceded from a different standpoint. It would be more logical to 

              think that a <i>prapanna</i> cannot do any other ritual because 

              he is fully saturated with thoughts of God. Such a person would 

              not be able to do anything at all on his own. He would have to depend 

              upon others even for his day-to-day physical requirements such as 

              bathing, dressing and eating. Such a <i>prapanna</i> would become 

              an introvert and would be totally unaware of what is going on outside. 

              Would such a person really be expected to perform the normal <i>dharmas 

              </i>meant for others? The following verse of Lilasuka (<i>Srikrsnakarnamrta 

              </i>2.106) may be noted in this connection: </p>

            <p align="center"><i>sandhyavandana! bhadramastu bhavate, bho snana! 

              tubhyam namah </i> <i><br>

              bho devah! pitarasca! tarpanavidhau naham ksamah ksamyatam<br>

              yatra kvapi nisidya yadavakulottamsasya kamsadvisah<br>

              smaram smaram agham harami tadalam manye kimanyena me? </i> </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> Sandhyvandana, may you keep well! O ablutions, salutations 

              to you! O Gods and Manes, forgive me since I am incapable of propitiating 

              and pleasing you. I will sit somewhere and remove my sins by repeatedly 

              recollecting the Enemy of Kamsa [Krsna] who is the Jewel of the 

              Yadava clan. I think that is enough for me. Of what avail are other 

              things? </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            Another point concerns the actual interpretation of the sentence, 

            <i>sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam</i> <i>saranam vraja</i> (<i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

            18.66). Has one to give up all <i>dharmas</i> to become a <i>prapanna</i>, 

            or does one become a <i>prapanna</i> and then give up all <i>dharmas</i>? 

            The words of the text seem to suggest that giving up all <i>dharmas</i> 

            is a preparatory stage to becoming a ­<i>prapanna</i>. In actual fact, 

            however, all duties are given up only when one becomes a ­<i>prapanna</i>. 

            The solution to the puzzle lies in the sentence's interpretation. 

            This same problem can be found in Sanksrit grammar - which act precedes 

            which in sentences such as <i>mukham vyadaya svapiti</i> (He opens 

            his mouth and sleeps)? Does one open the mouth first and then sleep, 

            or does one fall asleep and then open the mouth? The latter is the 

            correct answer, but the former is used in everyday speech. 

            <p></p>

            There need also be no doubt as to whether Arjuna was a <i>prapanna</i> 

            because in the second canto of the <i>Gita</i> itself we have evidence 

            to the effect that Arjuna did surrender to the Lord: <i>sisyate 'ham 

            sadhi</i> <i>mam tvam prapannan</i> (I am your disciple and have surrendered 

            to you. Kindly instruct me). It is thus clear that both sects are 

            right, in their own way, in understanding the need or otherwise to 

            perform <i>dharmas</i> in the case of <i>prapannas</i>. There is therefore 

            no controversy. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Conclusion </b> 

            <p></p>

            Thus far we have examined nine of the eighteen doctrinal differences 

            between the two prominent Srivaisnava sects of South India in an effort 

            to demonstrate that these so-called differences are merely the result 

            of variations in the interpretation of the authoritative texts such 

            as the <i>srutis </i>and <i>smrtis</i>. It must be borne in mind that 

            as far as the philosophy is concerned, it is known as Sri Ramanuja 

            Darsana or Sri-sampradaya only, both sects owing their allegiance 

            to it. The vast and wonderful literature that has been generated by 

            the advocates of their two sects is quite valuable, scholarly, amazing 

            and inspiring. However, their real merit lies in strengthening the 

            Sri-sampradaya from all external criticism and attack. Even today, 

            enormous harm is being done to the tradition by the petty skirmishes 

            indulged in by the advocates of these schools over issues which are 

            relatively minor and trivial and which, for the most part, are more 

            of an academic nature than of any substantial value to the ordinary 

            practitioner. 

            <p></p>

            To conclude, I would like to briefly consider a different issue, which 

            has also become very important in the post-Ramanuja period: that is 

            the position of Sri Krsna. 'Is He one of the <i>avataras</i> of Lord 

            Visnu or is He the (<i>avatarin</i>) Supreme Being Himself?' is the 

            question we might ask. The <i>Bhagavata-Purana</i> has glorified Sri 

            Krsna as the Supreme Being, declaring: <i>ete camsakalah pumsah</i> 

            <i>krsnastu bhagavan svayam</i> (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i> 1.3.28). 

            'All others [i.e. other incarnations] are only fractions of partial 

            manifestations of the Supreme Being. Krsna is the Supreme Being Himself.' 

            <p></p>

            The Srivaisnava system, perpetuated by the mystic saints, slvars and 

            <i>acaryas</i> accepts Sri Krsna as the most affable and perfect incarnation 

            of Visnu. He is the <i>purnavatara</i>. However, it does not accord 

            to Krsna the status of being the source of all other incarnations. 

            Sri Krsna is therefore considered to be an <i>avatara </i>of Visnu, 

            not the <i>avatarin</i> Himself. However, theological schools such 

            as the Suddhadvaita of Sri Vallabhacarya and the Acintyabhedabheda 

            of Sri Krsna Caitanya declare that even Visnu is an <i>amsa</i> of 

            Lord Sri Krsna. The <i>Gitagovinda[<a href="#6f">6</a>]<a name="6"></a> 

            </i>of Jayadeva is perhaps the most eloquent literary poem that proclaims 

            in lilting songs the supremacy of Lord Krsna. The <i>Bhagavata-Purana</i>, 

            to which all these songs attach the greatest importance, declares 

            this fact, they argue. <i>Brahma-Samhita</i> is another scripture 

            revered by the followers of Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According 

            to this tradition, He acquired the fifth chapter of this important 

            text from the sdikesava temple in Tamil Nadu, South India, during 

            His visit there. The opening verse of this text declares Sri Krsna 

            as the Supreme Godhead, the prime cause of all causes: 

            <p></p>

            <div align="center"><i>isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah</i><i><br>

              anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam </i> </div>

            <p align="center"></p>

            Why should there be this difference in the standpoints of Ramanuja 

            and those of other <i>acaryas</i>, although they are all Vaisnavas? 

            The cause can be traced to the importance given to the <i>Bhagavata 

            </i>and <i>Brahma-samhita</i> in ancient times and the interpretation 

            of the crucial verses mentioned above. While the followers of Ramanuja 

            see the <i>Astaksari-mantra,</i> centering around Sriman-Narayana, 

            as the <i>mulamantra</i> (being the <i>vyapaka mantra</i>),[<a href="#7f">7</a>] 

            <a name="7"></a>the other Vaisnava schools have formed their own <i>mulamantras</i>,<i> 

            </i>which centre around Lord Krsna,[<a href="#8f">8</a>]<a name="8"></a> 

            for sacred chanting and meditation. 

            <p></p>

            However, this does not, and need not, bring in any controversy between 

            the various theology schools that have developed after Ramanuja. Interpretation 

            of the texts and the traditional beliefs and practices over the centuries 

            have paved the way for the various sects and schools. The strength 

            of the Vedanta system lies in its mosaic and the capacity to accommodate 

            different points of view which, of course, do not lead to any serious 

            area of dissent and discord among the votaries. <i>Samanvaya</i>, 

            or synthesis, is the genius of the Indian mind. The <i>Rg Veda </i>declares 

            with a trumpet voice that 'what exists is one, although wise men call 

            it by different names'.<a name="9"></a>[<a href="#9f">9</a>] While 

            variety is the art of nature, unity is the heart of God.
