              In this article Krsna-lila Dasi examines methods of scriptural interpretation. 

              She looks at the validity of modern literary theory in relation 

              to literatures that are held as items of faith and describes the 

              strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Krsna-lila finds that 

              in the Vaisnava tradition a student of scripture can retain scholarly 

              integrity without appearing to diminish the spiritual value of such 

              works. </i> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>According to Jewish theology, men are of two kinds: the man of 

              questions and the man of answers. The man of questions is the scientist 

              who is constantly questioning the world, seeking to know its secrets, 

              while the man of answers is the believer who is inclined to think 

              that God has already given the answers to everything. Therefore, 

              the latter does not ask questions; instead, he becomes absorbed 

              in the answer - i.e. the revealed scriptures. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The keyword of the scientist is 'reason'; that of the believer 

              is 'faith'. According to Descartes, science examines the way the 

              world is, while religion tries to define how it should be. In days 

              of yore these two aspects of cognition were inseparable. In their 

              'lovers' quarrel', religion and science sometimes turned their backs 

              on each other; indeed they often threw harsh words at each other 

              - but they were still aware of the fact that they could not do without 

              each other.<a name="1"></a>[<a href="#1f" class="maintext">1</a>] 

              The greatest split between the two took place with the advent of 

              the Enlightenment, when science categorically declared independence 

              from its partner in matters of knowing the world. With the Enlightenment, 

              nature itself came to be regarded as the subject of examination 

              and interpretation; there was no longer a need to ask the ultimate 

              questions of human existence. Men of learning rejected all knowledge-acquiring 

              methods that could not be backed by empirical evidence, and human 

              reason was regarded as having a power akin to God's omnipotence.<b> 

              </b>Thus science had embarked on its own career: industry and technology 

              had begun to develop at a furious pace in order to make people forget 

              the absence of the dismissed 'lover'. The triumphal progress of 

              Reason reached its climax in the mid-nineteenth century with the 

              advent of positivism. Positivism, as the intellectual successor 

              of the Enlightenment, sought to find its solid basis solely in facts 

              and observation. It entirely neglected religious or metaphysical 

              explanations of the world. Thanks to the ­Darwinian theory of evolution, 

              God was no longer regarded as the rightful Creator, and later - 

              on the basis of Nietzsche's analysis<b> </b>- God was declared to 

              be dead.[<a href="#2f" class="maintext">2</a>] <a name="2"></a></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>According to many, however, science has today given up much of 

              its aspiration to the role of the redeemer. As the philosophy of 

              science has developed, it has become more and more accepted that 

              information coming from sense perception may be imperfect. One cannot 

              claim that the information provided by the senses is objective; 

              the interpretation of sensory information and the extra-perceptional 

              activity of the mind by which it assigns meaning to these pieces 

              of information, also greatly depend on the mentality and paradigm 

              of the interpreter.[<a href="#3f" class="maintext">3</a>]<a name="3"></a> 

              As a consequence, facts in themselves do not exist; they can only 

              exist in relation to theories.[<a href="#4f" class="maintext">4</a>] 

              <a name="4"></a>Michel Foucault assumes that modern scientific thinking, 

              which was thought to be objective and neutral, most often approaches 

              its subject by means of a well definable world view: methodological 

              atheism. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Methodological foundations</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The aforementioned view is especially valid in modern literary 

              criticism. One of the most important notions of the aesthetics of 

              reception is that literature is a discipline of dialogue: there 

              are no true or false readings. From within a certain paradigm everything 

              is true, while from without, everything seems to be false. Literary 

              theory is essentially based on understanding; therefore, the capturing 

              of the meaning is only possible from a subjective position. Literary 

              theory does not have a methodology which would form its reliable 

              core; as the Hungarian literary critic Bókay Antal has put it, 'there 

              is no such thing - and cannot be such a thing - as a universal theory 

              of literature. We can only speak of a loose field of pluralistic 

              readings.' (Bokay p. 22). Paul Ricoeur and the already mentioned 

              Foucault have written that different ages and different cultures 

              have their own types of speech, their own discourses, which are 

              but determining worldviews - paradigms - in which the applied texts 

              gain meaning in a specific way. According to Foucault, the reason 

              why we can never be objective is that we do not merely know the 

              discourse, but we live it, and this determines our judgments and 

              actions without our being conscious of it. (And this is true for 

              the simple reception of literature and its scientific research alike.) 

              Taking this into consideration, and also taking into consideration 

              the essentially pluralistic nature of literary theory, presenting 

              the Gaudiya<i> </i>Vaisnava literature through the believer's paradigm 

              is on an equal footing with, for example, presenting Indian literature 

              through the paradigm of the non-believing Indologist-researcher. 

              In the realm of social science, to apply the 'participant's' - the 

              inner observer's - standpoint is a method that has become increasingly 

              common and accepted during the past decade. This method takes for 

              its basis the standpoint of the 'social player', i.e. the standpoint 

              of the participant of the medium examined. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Using this as a starting point, I have assumed the role of mediator 

              in the relationship of the two capricious 'lovers' - faith and reason 

              - while presenting the Gaudiya literature from a specific viewpoint: 

              that of the literary critic who has grown up with Western scientific 

              thinking and at the same time that of the participant of the Caitanyaite 

              religious tradition. I hope this twofold approach of reason and 

              faith will result in an authentic and fruitful discourse both from 

              the point of view of literary science and that of the Caitanyaite 

              tradition. It is also my hope that the scientific doubts involved 

              will induce the practising believer to deeper reflections, and at 

              the same time those mysteries of the literature of the tradition 

              that would not be revealed before the questioning of mere intellectual 

              analysis may be revealed to the practising scientist. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Bearing in mind the suggestion of Earl Miner - a literary critic 

              dealing with comparative studies of Far-Eastern cultures - I thought 

              it more fruitful to carry out theoretical examinations rather than 

              practical analyses of different works when presenting the Gaudiya 

              Vaisnava literature outside India. My main interest lies in what 

              the given tradition thinks of literature itself. (Miner p. 5) My 

              research thus centres around the nature of Bengali Vaisnava literature 

              and the examination of literature's basic component factors: the 

              author, the work of art, the recipient, and their interaction. My 

              conclusions are primarily drawn from studying works that serve as 

              the basis for the tradition. These works constitute an important 

              part of the Gaudiya literary canon, works that the Caitanyaite community 

              has most often read and reread in the past five hundred years. From 

              this point of view, besides the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and the <i>Bhagavata 

              Purana </i>(also known as <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>), which contain 

              the philosophical foundations of a worldview that gave birth to 

              Caitanyaite art and literature, three other sources and their documented 

              history of reception were especially important. These were works 

              representing three different genres by three different authors who 

              are probably the authors most accepted and appreciated in the Bengali 

              Vaisnava tradition. These are Rupa Goswami's drama <i>Lalita-madhava 

              </i>(sixteenth century), Bhaktivinoda's songbook <i>Saranagati</i> 

              (nineteenth century) and Krsnadasa Kaviraja's biography known as 

              <i>Caitanya Caritamrta </i>(seventeenth century).[<a href="#5F" class="maintext">5</a>]

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Notion, character and role of literature in Gaudiya Vaisnava 

              culture</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Literature is not something that can be defined once and for all. 

              It means something different depending on the age, community and 

              the person who approaches it. The works included in our literary 

              canons are also of many kinds. For example, there is a considerable 

              difference between the literary fictions of works produced in Western 

              and Eastern cultures. Using the logic of Aristotle's <i>Poetics 

              </i>as a basis<i>,</i> the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye 

              makes a very interesting analysis. (Frye, pp. 33-5) The ancient 

              theoretician classified the literary hero into three categories: 

              the hero can be (a) better (stronger, more powerful) than us, (b) 

              on the same level with us, or (c) worse (inferior, weaker) than 

              us. Frye examines the type of heroes that characterise the literature 

              and the modes of literary fiction of different ages. The central 

              figures of epics, tragedies, legends and certain romantic works 

              are in high mimetic mode. Here the hero is either qualitatively 

              superior to others and to his environment - a kind of divine being 

              whose story is a myth - or he rises in degree above others but not 

              above his environment, and he is the leader. The lower mimetic mode 

              is the mode of the realist novel and of most comedies. Here the 

              hero is not superior to others or his environment. He is one of 

              us, and we expect the author to apply the same rules of verisimilitude 

              that we know from our own experience. An example of the ironic fictional 

              mode is the absurd drama in which the 'hero' is inferior to, more 

              schematic, more defenceless than us. After reviewing these categories, 

              Frye concludes that in European culture during the past fifteen 

              hundred years the centre of gravity of literary fiction has been 

              constantly tending downwards. He adds that in his view Asian fiction 

              was unable to move very far away from mythic and romantic formulae. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>If Frye is correct in his assessment of Asian fiction, one is tempted 

              to think about the possible reasons. From among Eastern cultures, 

              it is Indian literature I have some perspective on. Although there 

              are a number of modern literary works in India, the people of India 

              still very much revere the ancient, unbroken tradition, which even 

              today permeates everyday life to a great extent. The vision of time 

              of this tradition is not linear but cyclic. Its essence is steadiness, 

              the eternal repetition and experience of Transcendence, the preservation 

              and transmission of spiritual knowledge. In its essentially traditional 

              art, what is 'new' is not necessarily valuable; 'progress' is not 

              a very relevant notion. Using Northrop Frye's categories, the Gaudiya 

              Vaisnava literary tradition - the field of my research - nourishes 

              itself from the art of high mimetic mode. This mode was also characteristic 

              of the ages preceding modernity that started with the Renaissance 

              and became consummate in the age of the Enlightenment. For Gaudiya 

              literature, the ancient Hindu epics as well as the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              and the <i>Bhagavata-purana</i> (of this latter, mainly the Tenth 

              Canto, which presents Krsna's acts, or <i>lilas</i>) are highly 

              important sources of inspiration. The 'centre of gravity' of literary 

              fiction has not sunk at all during the centuries since the renaissance 

              and the re-evaluation of Vaisnava tradition and the impregnation 

              of its art brought about by the presence of Caitanya. The central 

              figures of even present day Bengali Vaisnava literary works are 

              primarily God - Krsna Himself or His incarnation Caitanya - and 

              His close associates, or purified sages and saints who rise above 

              the masses of ordinary people. The literature of Gaudiya Vaisnavism 

              could best be compared to the literature of medieval Christian mysticism 

              in Europe, in which the author - of whom it is held that 'God conceals 

              nothing from his eyes' - would like to share the experience of his 

              meeting with Transcendence with the open-hearted, receptive audience. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>When participants of the still living Gaudiya tradition experience 

              and express the world, they sense the secret of a spiritual and 

              mystic essence behind everything. This consciousness, which sees 

              everything in relation to God, makes every seemingly profane act 

              sacred. Their way of deciphering the world is essentially transcendental: 

              in the background of worldly chaos they presume there to be a coherent 

              system of correspondence of the ­Absolute. For them, phenomena have 

              a significance beyond themselves: the events of their lives, the 

              occurrences, their destinies have a cosmic meaning. The real space 

              is the mystic space, the real time is the divine time. 'History' 

              in the Western sense does not really have significance. It is the 

              eternal and recurring events that convey the real importance, which 

              become enacted again and again during festivals and similar celebratory 

              occasions, thus demonstrating the stability of Transcendence. For 

              Gaudiya Vaisnavas who take their tradition seriously, things are 

              meaningful only if they are in connection with or can be connected 

              to Transcendence. Everything else falls outside of their sphere 

              of interest. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In such a context, art cannot exist for art's sake. As with archaic 

              cultures, the concept of art and religion in Bengali Vaisnavism 

              is that of unity. There are no distinct boundaries between the two. 

              Here the goal of art, just like the goal of all human activity, 

              is to establish the present-ness of Transcendence, to awaken the 

              inherently female (<i>prak</i><i>r</i><i>ti</i>) soul's loving desire 

              for God (the man, the <i>puru</i><i>s</i><i>a</i>), and finally, 

              to promote their meeting again after so many births and deaths. 

              The most important function of literature is to build a bridge between 

              the immanent and the metaphysical worlds, so that the soul, which 

              has fallen into this phenomenal world, may overcome the pains of 

              material existence. Besides these, from the author's point of view 

              the need to become spiritually purified by the process of writing 

              is also important. Thus the informative and aesthetic values are 

              both present in works of art. They are important sources of knowledge, 

              education and entertainment. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>According to the principal spiritual work of Caitanyaism - the 

              <i>Bhagavatam </i>- the primary goal of artistic creation and writing 

              is to bring pleasure to the Lord and to glorify Him, which simultaneously 

              satisfies the soul.[<a href="#6f" class="maintext">6</a>]<a name="6"></a> 

              In a broader sense, the Vaisnava tradition considers as canonised 

              literature every written (or orally transmitted) work that directly 

              or indirectly presents Transcendence and involves some <i>siddhanta</i> 

              (metaphysical understanding) and is authorised as such by the authorities 

              of the tradition. In a stricter sense, however, the Vaisnava tradition 

              specifies the basic requirement for any literary work as the unity 

              of <i>rasa </i>(aesthetic presentation) and <i>siddhanta</i>. A 

              literary work of art can be beautiful only if it integrates <i>rasa</i> 

              and <i>siddhanta </i>in a harmonious way. If the artistic form becomes 

              more prominent, the work loses its authenticity in the eyes of the 

              Vaisnava community; and if the balance is lost in favour of the 

              <i>siddhanta</i>, then we cannot speak of a literary work in the 

              strict or modern sense (but of a philosophical treatise bearing 

              some literary elements). </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Bengali Vaisnavism usually applies the notion of literature in 

              the broader sense. In this approach, <i>siddhanta</i>, or the purity 

              of the philosophical thought, is more important than <i>rasa</i>, 

              the aesthetic function. Works which are imperfect in their composition 

              or poetic form but are related to the Lord are included in its canon, 

              while those works which, no matter how perfect in poetic composition, 

              do not glorify the Lord but were written from some other personal 

              motive are rejected as 'pilgrimage places of crows'.[<a href="#7f" class="maintext">7</a>] 

              <a name="7"></a>This means the primary role of literature is not 

              to provide some aesthetic experience or to 'inform', but to 'transform'. 

              Those works that were not conceived in a God-centred spirit are 

              rejected and remain unread by the Vaisnava community, because in 

              its view they would only increase the illusion and bodily consciousness 

              of the readers and thus keep them entangled in material existence.[<a href="#8f" class="maintext">8</a>] 

              <a name="8"></a>The primary canon-making factors and authorities 

              of the tradition are therefore the saints and the perfectly purified 

              teachers. Tradition ranks among them the contemporary Vaisnava teacher 

              Bhaktivedanta Swami who, referring to Vedic scriptures, states in 

              a commentary to a <i>Bhagavatam</i> text that all literary works 

              involving some authorised <i>siddhanta</i> which directly or indirectly 

              deal with the glories of the Lord have to be considered <i>sruti-mantra,</i> 

              or scripture. Therefore the same criteria apply to these literary 

              works as to other revelations.[<a href="#9f" class="maintext">9</a>]<a name="9"></a> 

              Bhaktivedanta Swami states that the literature of Caitanyaism is 

              non-different from ancient scriptures. Outstanding authors like 

              Rupa Goswami, Krsnadasa Kaviraja and Bhaktivinoda Thakura were purified 

              souls, and all of them had a perfect vision of the Absolute. Their 

              writings can therefore be considered as transcendental works - revelations.

            <p></p>

            <p><b>The author</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In the Gaudiya Vaisnava culture that author is considered a <i>s</i><i>ik</i><i>s</i><i>a-guru</i>, 

              or a bona fide teacher, who stands before the audience not only 

              with his or her thoughts (<i>pracar</i>) but also with his or her 

              personal example (<i>acar</i>). It is required that the author be 

              a Vaisnava of spotless character, and also deeply religious, or 

              at least sincerely aspiring to be so. He or she has to be a member 

              of a bona fide disciplic succession and has to have the blessings 

              of other Vaisnavas to engage in the process of writing. Therefore 

              the poet and the writer has to be a transparent medium because according 

              to Vaisnavas, the light of God can only shine through a humble and 

              sincere heart. It cannot arise from personal motivations, the desire 

              for fame and recognition, or material desires of other kinds.[<a href="#10f" class="maintext">10</a>] 

              <a name="10"></a>The Vaisnava author has a mission similar to that 

              of Hermes: to mediate between the transcendent and the immanent 

              worlds. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In regard to the process of creation, we have to distinguish between 

              two methods. The first is when the author mainly relies on the commentaries, 

              works and experiences of preceding Vaisnava teachers in his creative 

              work. His or her intention is not to invent anything new but to 

              shed new light on things already presented, to present them in more 

              detail, or maybe to elaborate upon them in a more artistic way. 

              Krsnadasa compares this to 'fluffing out the compressed cotton'.[<a href="#11f" class="maintext">11</a>]<a name="11"></a> 

              This creative method can also be used by those Vaisnavas who have 

              not yet attained the perfection of spiritual life. In the second 

              method, which is applicable only by purified saints, the basis of 

              creation and the source of inspiration is the mystical experience. 

              These works communicate things the reader could not have read in 

              earlier authentic writings. According to the tradition, the transcendental 

              world is unlimited. For example, Krsna's acts, or <i>lilas,</i> 

              are related in great detail in the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>, but 

              since these are continuously taking place and are recurring in unlimited 

              time and space, it is impossible to fully describe them. Tradition 

              says they can be seen and experienced by the pure devotee, who then 

              can impart them to others. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The process of literary creation takes place in the following way: 

              the transcendental world is revealed to the purified author in his 

              or her meditation. By his or her spiritual realisation the author 

              is able to see the Lord and His associates, and the Lord's so far 

              unmanifested <i>lilas</i> manifest before him or her also. This 

              is the process of <i>lila-smarana</i> (the process of visualisation 

              and meditation). This creative method is quite widespread in Gaudiya<i> 

              </i>Vaisnava literature. Literary works written in this way and 

              authorised by the authorities are not held to be the products of 

              mere imagination but are accepted as completely true. According 

              to the tradition, until there are pure devotees of the Lord the 

              gates of the transcendental world remain closed to earthly mortals. 

              Through the medium of pure souls the Lord imparts ever-new truths 

              and pieces of information to mankind. In this respect dramas, poems 

              and other works are not merely products of the poetic imagination 

              but revelations - unless the author explicitly states otherwise.[<a href="#12f" class="maintext">12</a>] 

              <a name="12"></a> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The aesthetics of the literary work of art as revelation had been 

              worked out by Rupa in his <i>rasa</i> theory.[<a href="#13f" class="maintext">13</a>] 

              <a name="13"></a>Niel Delmonico notes that by synthesising classical 

              Sanskrit aesthetics, Rupa reverts to the transcendental understanding 

              of <i>rasa</i> mentioned in earlier Hindu texts.[<a href="#14f" class="maintext">14</a>]<a name="14"></a> 

              In the <i>rasa </i>theory, religious and aesthetic experiences are 

              interwoven. The reason for this is that in Gaudiya<i> </i>theology 

              art is a basic substance of Transcendence. The supreme object of 

              religious devotion - God - is at the same time the source and supreme 

              master of all art. The scripture most often quoted by Caitanya, 

              <i>Brahma-samhita,</i> states that in God's realm everything is 

              art: 'every word is a song, every step is a dance.'[<a href="#15f" class="maintext">15</a>] 

              <a name="15"></a>Therefore, if anyone wants to describe this in 

              a truly expressive way, then, according to Caitanya, besides one's 

              pure devotion, excellent poetic words are also required.[<a href="#16f" class="maintext">16</a>] 

              <a name="16"></a>Followers of the tradition opine that Rupa restores 

              poetics' sacred nature, which had become profaned during the millennia. 

              By doing so, he reinstates literature to its original, transcendental 

              status. The Gaudiya tradition holds that Krsna's<i> lilas</i> are 

              ever recurring in the course of past, present and future as a wonderful, 

              endless drama in which God, together with His associates and the 

              other souls, play their respective roles while experiencing unfathomable 

              bliss. In Rupa's aesthetics, which are based on this concept, the 

              goal of literature and religious practice is the same: to recognise, 

              relearn and assume one's long forgotten role in this great drama, 

              and to again - this time irrevocably - take part in this 'divine 

              comedy' which ensures one perfect happiness. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>The literary work</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>If we accept Frye's analysis as our starting point, as well as 

              the fact that Bengali Vaisnava texts mainly draw upon the <i>Bhagavata 

              Purana</i>, an interesting question arises: how do Gaudiya literary 

              works relate to earlier sacred texts? What is the relationship between 

              the literary and the sacred? Since a work of art as <i>artefactum</i> 

              automatically means that it is some kind of artificial 'product', 

              can a literary work be a revelation at all? Are the models referring 

              to the interaction of the sacred text and the literary text valid 

              as we know them in Western culture? </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The Hungarian literary critic Tibor Fabiny differentiates three 

              types of relationship between the sacred text and literature or 

              the sacred text and its literary adaptations.[<a href="#17f" class="maintext">17</a>] 

              <a name="17"></a>He calls the texts that the given tradition considers 

              sacred 'architext', and the individual literary works (the adaptations 

              of sacred texts) 'supertext'. The three types of relationship between 

              the architext and the supertext, i.e. between the sacred text and 

              literature, are the following: </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The first model applies to mundane authors who 'use' the sacred 

              text. For them only literature is 'reality'; the sacred text is 

              merely a 'pretext' to provide a <i>topos</i> for their literary 

              work. According to Fabiny, in this case the integrity of the sacred 

              text is damaged. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The second model applies to members of a religious community who 

              deal with literature: for them it is the sacred text (the architext) 

              alone that has real value, and literature (the supertext) becomes 

              only a 'pretext'. Fabiny states this is an essentially reductive 

              and deterministic view, similar to Marxism, which only 'uses' literature 

              to propagate some ­conviction or dogma. In this case it is the integrity 

              of literature which suffers damage: it loses its autonomy because 

              the value of the literary work is determined not by aestheticism 

              but by external, ideological considerations which are alien to its 

              nature. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It is the third model that Fabiny considers the ideal type. This 

              treats both the architext and the supertext as real and valid. In 

              this model the supertext is a re-creation of the architext. For 

              the first model only literature has integrity; for the second, only 

              the sacred text has integrity; and for the third, both the sacred 

              text and literature have their own integrity. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I agree with Fabiny that it is not proper to judge a sacred text 

              by literary standards or a literary text by theological ones. There 

              is also no doubt that the approach adopted by Fabiny in his second 

              model is to be found in the Gaudiya tradition. In this case the 

              integrity of the philosophical message of the works (in their own 

              terminology, the <i>siddhanta</i>) has a priority over the aesthetic 

              form (<i>rasa</i>). The reason for this, as mentioned earlier, lies 

              primarily in the fact that the notion of literature is used in a 

              broader sense than in the modern understanding. In my view most 

              of the works I refer to (e.g. <i>Lalita-madhava, Saranagati</i>) 

              are characterised by the harmonious unity of <i>rasa</i> and <i>siddhanta.</i> 

              This means they can be considered as authentic from the standpoint 

              of the Gaudiya tradition and at the same time<i> </i>they can be 

              interpreted as literary works. Now, the exciting question arises 

              as to whether it is possible to consider a revelation a literary 

              work and a literary work a revelation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I will cite three examples in this respect. The first is Jayadeva's 

              <i>Gita-govinda.</i> Although this work was written well before 

              the appearance of Caitanyaism, it can be completely connected to 

              its spirituality. The second is Rupa Goswami's drama <i>Lalita-madhava</i>, 

              and the third Bhaktivinoda's songbook entitled <i>Saranagati</i>. 

              If we wish to apply Tibor Fabiny's terminology, we could say the 

              architext of these works is the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> - the Vaisnava 

              scripture presenting Krsna's life and acts<i>.</i> However, the 

              three supertexts contain elements that cannot be found in the architext. 

              For example, it is Jayadeva who in the Vaisnava tradition states 

              for the first time what the <i>Bhagavata </i>only alludes to, namely 

              that those who love Krsna have a power over Him. From among these 

              persons the foremost is Radha, who later in the Gaudiya tradition 

              will become one of the supreme objects of religious devotion. (Huberman, 

              p. 76) The importance of our second example, <i>Lalita-madhava</i>,<i> 

              </i>is seen by Jiva Goswami, the main theoretician of the Gaudiya<i> 

              </i>tradition, in that here Rupa reveals the mystery of the difference 

              between God's acts performed in the transcendental world (<i>aprakata-lila</i>) 

              and those performed during his earthly descent (<i>prakata-lila</i>). 

              In the third example, the author of <i>Saranagati</i> reveals his 

              own position in the transcendental world, the personal relationship 

              he has with God, whom he calls Krsna. According to the Gaudiya<i> 

              </i>tradition - since the authors in question are saints - these 

              pieces of 'additional' information are not simply the products of 

              poetic imagination but are new manifestations of ­Transcendence. 

              Therefore, as with the <i>Bhagavata Purana,</i> tradition relates 

              to these three works - the supertexts - also as sacred texts, or 

              architexts. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Even if we agree to approach these texts as if they are sacred, 

              it is proper to ask if these works can be considered as literature 

              at all. Would it not be more appropriate to call them sacred works 

              containing literary elements? I have not found any clear-cut analogues 

              in Western literature for the interrelationship of architext and 

              supertext that characterises Vaisnava texts. One possibility might 

              be to compare the relationship between the Bible (as architext) 

              and Dante's <i>Divine Comedy </i>(as supertext) to the relationship 

              between the Vaisnava scripture <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> and the Vaisnava 

              drama <i>Lalita-madhava</i>. I believe this analogy fails because 

              the <i>Divine Comedy </i>is not a canonised work and is not regarded 

              as a revelation within the Christian tradition. In the first case, 

              a sacred text is in relationship with a literary work (even if the 

              latter was no doubt inspired by the <i>Bible</i>), while in the 

              second, according to the tradition two sacred texts (architexts) 

              are juxtaposed. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Another analogy may be found by comparing the aforementioned Vaisnava 

              texts with the Old Testament as architext and its 'adaptation', 

              or supertext, the New Testament (or rather certain parts of it). 

              This analogy cannot be wholly applicable with regard to the relationship 

              of <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> and <i>Lalita-madhava</i> because the 

              New Testament<i> </i>is more similar to the Vaisnava architext in 

              character and style than to its supertext (which, as we have seen, 

              also became architext). The <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>, the Old Testament<i> 

              </i>and the New Testament can only be considered as literary works 

              in a very broad sense. Although they contain literary elements in 

              great number, aesthetic considerations did not play a major role 

              in their composition. On the other hand, <i>Lalita-madhava </i>was 

              written in accordance with the aesthetic rules of classical Sanskrit 

              drama, as becomes obvious from Rupa's work on drama theory,<i> Nataka-candrika</i>. 

              As regards its poetic language and composition, <i>Lalita-madhava 

              </i>is no doubt a literary work in which revelation and metaphysical 

              reality are present in such a way that these do not decrease the 

              aesthetic value of the drama (unlike, for example, Reformation dramas, 

              which are full of religious polemics but do not carry much aesthetic 

              value). </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>On the basis of this analysis it is perhaps not too rash to state 

              that these Vaisnava texts do not, or only partly, fit the tertiary 

              model of the architext - supertext relationship - which to me seems 

              somewhat Western-specific. Studying the mode of existence of these 

              Vaisnava texts led me to think that it is necessary to create a 

              fourth model, in which the supertext can be held a holy scripture 

              and a literary work at the same time. In this case the sacred and 

              the literary do not exist on an either-or basis but simultaneously, 

              within the same text, in inseparable symbiosis. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>The recipient</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I am convinced that the mode of existence of these Vaisnava works 

              is characterised by a complete intertwining of mysticism and aesthetics. 

              Consequently, the dialogue of the literary work and the recipient 

              can become most complete if in his or her approach the exegete applies 

              the respective criteria valid for the sacred and the literary simultaneously. 

              In my view it is when the recipient disregards this, considering 

              these works carriers of only metaphysical ideas or only literary 

              works, that their autonomy is damaged and they get placed out of 

              their own context. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>There are many examples for both types of reductive approach. I 

              consider the former type the internal affair of the Vaisnava community; 

              therefore, it is not appropriate to be dealt with in this forum. 

              It is the second type of reductive approach that may be more interesting 

              for the academic public, which, in my opinion, largely dominates 

              Western literary criticism. I will mention a few typical examples 

              in this connection. The work of the twelfth-century poet Jayadeva 

              is a source of inspiration for a culture shared by hundreds of millions 

              and permeates its spiritual and artistic world, while from the perspective 

              of Western literary criticism, its plot is a banal series of events 

              fit for a commonplace French comedy.[<a href="#18f" class="maintext">18</a>] 

              <a name="18"></a>While on the one side Rupa's drama is esteemed 

              to be 'an endless flow of nectar', Western literary criticism condemns 

              it for lacking in 'novelty' - a requirement Rupa never aspired to.[<a href="#19f" class="maintext">19</a>]<a name="19"></a> 

              It is clear that if we want to analyse the values of a literature 

              which is of a mystical kind within the context of modernity's discourse, 

              we will have a different result than if we try to do the same from 

              within the tradition. Modern man is just as unable to penetrate 

              the work's mysteries as a medieval man would be stupefied before 

              the ideal of beauty presented in Baudelaire's<i> A ­Carcass</i>. 

              Even in this case there would be some kind of communication between 

              the work, the author and the recipient. Experience shows, however, 

              that this could not reach such depths as would be possible were 

              these factors in the same context, or as Foucault puts it, were 

              they to live the same discourse. Given the completely intertwined 

              nature of sacredness and aesthetics I think the most effective way 

              to understand these works is to apply the standards of approaches 

              relating to literary and sacred texts simultaneously. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In the course of any kind of research, the subject and the method 

              should be in accord. The Vaisnava tradition rejects the historico-critical 

              approach on the basis of the principle of methodological atheism. 

              According to the tradition, this method is not suitable for understanding 

              texts of religious subject matter because it tries to understand 

              revelation from a standpoint <i>outside the revelation</i>. In their 

              invocation (<i>mangalacaranam</i>), Gaudiya<i> </i>Vaisnava literary 

              works very specifically determine what kind of attitude is required 

              to understand them. If the exegete is willing to follow the methodological 

              process suggested by the work itself, then - as Gerhard Maier very 

              aptly puts it - we can speak of a 'hermeneutics of dependence'. 

              (Maier, p. 115) Vaisnava works by their nature require the recipient 

              to enter into the dialogue as a 'participant' of the tradition. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Naturally, each recipient has the right to decide what attitude 

              they want to assume when approaching a literary work. The Vaisnava 

              tradition also accepts the recipient-centred principle of plurality 

              of modern literary hermeneutics. But, taking into account considerations 

              of the work itself, it adds that besides the fact that each interpretation 

              is equally justified, there are different levels of interpretation, 

              which depend on who the recipient is and how he or she relates to 

              the sacred. That's all very well, but what should the reader or 

              the critic (the exegete) do if he or she does not want to become 

              a member of the <i>parampara</i>, the Vaisnava disciplic succession, 

              which would initiate one into the tradition? According to Vaisnava 

              aesthetics, it is possible for one to get a deeper understanding 

              of the work if one behaves <i>as if </i>one were a participant of 

              the tradition, if at least during the time of reception one places 

              oneself into the participant's paradigm by the help of a provisional, 

              anticipatory faith <i>(sraddha</i>).[<a href="#20f" class="maintext">20</a>] 

              <a name="20"></a>I am convinced this interpretative attitude - which 

              is based on the dialogue of reason and faith, and which I call methodological 

              theism, while others call it the 'willing suspension of disbelief' 

              - is capable of ensuring the ideal equilibrium necessary for a fruitful 

              dialogue. Thus the autonomy of the literary work behaving as revelation 

              (or the revelation behaving as literary work) and the inner integrity 

              of the interpreter are both preserved. </p>

              to June McDaniel Gaudiya<i> </i>theological treatises (like Rupa's 

              <i>Bhakti-rasam</i><i>r</i><i>ta-sindhu</i> and <i>Ujjvala-nilamani</i>) 

              describe emotional states of mystical experience in a uniquely detailed 

              and systematic way. The description is often so meticulous that 

              the reader can almost experience it for himself or herself, and, 

              indeed, according to McDaniel the goal of many of the descriptions 

              is to enable the reader to attain these states. In McDaniel's view 

              the Gaudiya tradition and literature construct a sort of 'ladder' 

              to God, and one is encouraged to go step-by-step, until one reaches 

              <i>siddhi</i>, or perfection in mystical experience. (McDaniel, 

              pp. 283-4.) </p>

              of his papers Niel Delmonico notes that the <i>rasa </i>theory of 

              Rupa allows one to have a unique insight into the world of not only 

              the Gaudiya tradition, but of the religious-mystic experience in 

              general. It does so by presenting in great detail how the religious 

              experience is projected unto the everyday experience of the world.
