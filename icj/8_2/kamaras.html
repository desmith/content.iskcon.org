              This is the second report by István Kamarás based on his unique 

              and thorough survey of ISKCON in Hungary. The first appeared in 

              ICJ Volume 7, No. 2, and looked into the reactions by the Hungarian 

              government, media and public to the burgeoning Hare Krsna movement 

              in their country. This new report delves deeper and deals with issues 

              involving the change in lifestyle and value-systems of Hungarian 

              devotees since they first joined the movement and how these have 

              evolved. There are also comparisons with other sectors of Hungarian 

              society, including Christian monastic orders. This report is a snapshot 

              of the Society in Hungary in the late 1990s.</i></p>

            <p align="left"><i>Purpose, design and methodology </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">In 1995, the Community of Hungarian Devotees of Krsna 

              Consciousness (MKTHK) requested that a research project be conducted 

              to provide firsthand knowledge of the lifestyle, customs and value 

              systems of members of the Hare Krsna movement in Hungary. MKTHK 

              felt that such a study would be useful, since very view Hungarians 

              were aware of the Hare Krsna movement, and what impressions did 

              exist derived mostly from biased publications or statements in the 

              press. The research project, which involved data collection, interviews, 

              observation and analysis, was conducted from 1995 to 1997. The study 

              was first published in Hungary in 1998<a name="1"></a>[<a href="#1f" class="maintext">1</a>] 

              and was subsequently reported in <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i>.[<a href="#2f" class="maintext">2</a>] 

              <a name="2"></a> </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The study consisted of a questionnaire, completed 

              by 126 ISKCON devotees, and in-depth interviews with 68 devotees. 

              The devotees who took part in the study mostly consisted of the 

              core membership, but also included a small number of secular devotees, 

              strong sympathisers, and people who had formerly been involved in 

              the movement but had since weakened their connection. Interviews 

              were undertaken with one-third of the leaders (members of the National 

              Council and Temple Boards). The study sample included approximately 

              40% of the ISKCON devotees in Hungary who had received second initiation 

              (<i>brahmana </i>initiation); 20% of the ISKCON devotees in Hungary 

              who had received first initiation (<i>harinama </i>initation); and15-20% 

              of devotees who were then living in temples, preaching centres and 

              <i>a</i><i>s</i><i>ramas</i>. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Acting as a participating observer, I became familiar 

              with the everyday life of devotees from ISKCON Hungary's major preaching 

              centres in Budapest, Pécs, Szolnok, Eger, Debrecen and Krsna Valley 

              (an organic farm and Vedic cultural centre situated near the village 

              of Somogyvámos. We also attended a number of devotional programmes.<a name="3"></a>[<a href="#3f" class="maintext">3</a>] 

              Within the framework of a social-psychological experiment we showed 

              <i>Stalker</i>, a film by Andrei Tarkovsky, to 50 people (in three 

              small groups), after which we asked the audience to complete a questionnaire 

              and participate in group discussions. A test sheet containing poems 

              graphically describing transcendental experiences was completed 

              by 33 individuals. A brief questionnaire was also completed by 168 

              non-devotees, representing seven social groups, which tested their 

              knowledge of Vedic culture, Hinduism, Vaisnavism and the Hare Krsna 

              movement in general. In addition, we looked at articles that had 

              been published about Krsna devotees between 1990 and 1997 as well 

              as devotional, apologetic and theological publications (in Hungarian) 

              that mentioned Hare Krsna devotees. Finally, nine experts (consisting 

              of theologians, philosophers and culturologists) were asked to comment 

              on, interpret and evaluate 100 pages of texts selected from Hare 

              Krsna publications available to newly initiated Hungarian devotees 

              in the period 1994-7. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Roads </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Various roads lead to Krsna consciousness: they can 

              be short or long, straight or twisting (with detours, sudden stops 

              and setbacks). Some individuals even try several ways simultaneously. 

              Whilst some people accept the philosophy of Krsna consciousness 

              immediately and unconditionally, others can only proceed step-by-step. 

              There are some who stay in a 'negotiating position' for a long time 

              (sometimes for their whole lives). There are some who use the philosophy 

              to build on their previous personas while others totally repudiate 

              or replace past identities. There are some who consider their previous 

              life a mere preparation, the beginning of a journey or a period 

              of accumulating values, while others think it was time wasted. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The interviews revealed that in most cases no particular 

              crisis preceded conversion, but that conversion usually resulted 

              from gradual realisation that something was lacking in their lives, 

              often resulting in a quest for that missing part. In such cases 

              a strong (often cathartic) emotional experience played a significant 

              role in conversion, as did the influence of a seemingly genuine 

              and charismatic person who provided rational and easy to understand 

              answers through both speech and literature. The people most likely 

              to adopt the values of Krsna consciousness step-by-step were those 

              engaged in alternative lifestyles, those undertaking higher consciousness 

              leisure activities such as yoga, and those interested in oriental 

              culture, the mystical or the occult. As with other paths to conversion, 

              heightened emotions, personality changes and answers that provided 

              a secure reference point all played an important role. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">For those who started their inner journey as a result 

              of a deep crisis, a life jacket was provided by the atmosphere, 

              emotions, experiences, personal connections and community found 

              in Krsna consciousness. However, a certain percentage of individuals 

              finally stopped chanting and attending the programmes, and returned 

              to their former lifestyles. This process was noted especially with 

              regard to former drug users, although this study did not support 

              the assumption that such persons escaped from one type of ecstasy 

              to enter another. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left"><i>Effects and Changes </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">To the question 'What did you initially find the most 

              attractive?' the responses were as follows: knowledge (49%), the 

              persons involved (40%), the effects on the senses, especially by 

              music (31%), the purity of devotees (23%), the community (14%), 

              the atmosphere (13%) and the spirituality (10%). It was found that 

              women in particular were most strongly affected by a combination 

              of these factors. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">When asked 'How has Krsna consciousness changed your 

              life?' 44% of respondents answered 'radically', 'totally', or 'very 

              much', while others identified the special way in which this change 

              occurred: lifestyle (17%), security and happiness (13%), the presence 

              of a life goal (13%) and the perceived change in personality (10%). 

              For the newly converted, Krsna consciousness primarily represented 

              security and a loving community, while for the initiated it represented 

              a well-practised way of life, changes in personality, and spirituality. 

              By organising a control group of 35 Christians similar in age and 

              gender, we had an opportunity to compare Krsna and Christian monks. 

              Among Krsna monks, the main directions of change were lifestyle 

              and personality, while for Christians these factors were spirituality, 

              the spiritual horizon and the community. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Of Krsna devotees, 96% thought their personalities 

              had changed in a positive way since conversion. Most of them felt 

              they had become more humble and tolerant (24%), more determined 

              (16%), more harmonious (12%) and more sincere (10%). Women felt 

              this change as increased feelings of love whilst men perceived it 

              as greater determination. Rather more serious differences were found 

              in this respect between Christian and Krsna monks: Krsna monks felt 

              this change first of all in their emotions, level of openness and 

              purity, while Christians felt it more in their level of spirituality. 

            </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">To the question: 'What is it that interests you much 

              less now than before?' the answers were as follows: material goods 

              and success (36%), the satisfaction of the senses (15%), entertaining 

              low-quality arts (13%), watching television (13%), high-level arts 

              (13%) and entertainment (8%). After conversion, interest had increased 

              in the following areas: religious topics (36%), spiritual meditation 

              (26%), philosophy (16%) and science (9%). The interest of women 

              was broader and more spiritual than men. Krsna monks generally appeared 

              to be much more spiritual and inward looking than Christian monks, 

              who seemed to be more responsive both to the immediate and broader 

              communities. The shaping of the interests of Krsna devotees was 

              characterised by a simultaneous deepening internally and narrowing 

              externally, as well as the opening up of perspectives and the reduction 

              in interests. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">A large majority (90%) of Krsna devotees felt that 

              their relationships had changed since their conversion, with most 

              feeling that their existing relationships had improved. However, 

              many also said that old relationships had either been cut off or 

              had become secondary, and that they had found new friends in their 

              fellow devotees. It is also interesting to note that although conversion 

              to the Krsna faith resulted in a few devotees breaking off communication 

              with their families, in the majority of cases where contact had 

              been lost, it was the families themselves who were responsible for 

              this break. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Spiritual growth </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">For the majority of Hungarian devotees, the authentic 

              line of spiritual succession is led by Prabhupada himself, then 

              Sivarama Swami (the Governing Body Commissioner for Hungary) and/or 

              the devotees' own spiritual masters. No justification for the bombastic, 

              biased and hostile image of the guru could be detected from these 

              interviews. The fact that some ISKCON gurus abandoned their vows 

              and fell away from ISKCON - a significant event in the history of 

              ISKCON and an event that is still causing a great deal of damage 

              - was largely unknown to Hungarian Krsna devotees. Since devout 

              respect, dedicated service and obedience towards the guru is a basic 

              requirement, the study did not uncover much criticism of the guru. 

              It is possible, however, that among certain devotees this unconditionally 

              accepting, uncritical attitude, which comes close to constituting 

              a personality cult, may become an obstacle to further personal development. 

              The majority of devotees saw no problem with the impersonality of 

              the disciple/guru relationship; indeed it is possible that a more 

              personal relationship would actually disturb them. Nonetheless, 

              a significant number still desired a more personal relationship. 

              We have to take into consideration, particularly among girls and 

              young women, a devotee's adoration, idolisation and even Platonic 

              love. It was observed several times that a less personal relationship 

              with the <i>dik</i><i>s</i><i>a</i> (initiating) guru is compensated 

              for by a more personal (warm, friendly, fraternal or fatherly) relationship 

              with the s<i>ik</i><i>s</i><i>a</i> (instructing) guru. It is not 

              known what effect correspondence or communication through an interpreter, 

              and the identity of the official and the spiritual masters, has 

              on the quality of Krsna consciousness. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Brainwashing? </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The study found no evidence of perceived 'brainwashing' 

              or psychological manipulation (taking advantage of others' distress); 

              instances of 'gentle force' were also rare. It seems that the term 

              'love bombing', which frequently appears in anti-cult literature, 

              is inappropriate to describe this group. In spectacular cases of 

              conversion, the most important factor seemed to be the authenticity 

              of the Krsna devotees themselves. It seems that in many cases, conversion 

              is not so much a paradigm shift but the continuation of the same 

              paradigm in an altered state.<a name="4"></a>[<a href="#4f" class="maintext">4</a>] 

              In many cases it is difficult to determine whether Krsna devotees 

              acted out well-rehearsed roles or if they embodied new identities, 

              which, rather than negating the old roles, actually serve to build 

              on them. This poses the question as to what it is that Krsna devotees 

              have found: a shelter, a dead-end street, themselves, fellow travellers 

              on the road to self-development, their destination or the path leading 

              there? </p>

            <p align="left"><i>The most attractive features </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Up to seven years after joining, devotees considered 

              the following the most attractive features in their lives: knowledge 

              (42%), spirituality (25%), sensuality (15%), lifestyle (15%), and 

              purity of the devotees (10%). Among the initiated, 'spiritual leader' 

              was mentioned as a factor. The effect of others appeared to be a 

              lesser factor and personal spirituality a greater factor. However, 

              there appeared no fundamental change in the relative importance 

              of these features over time, which could imply that the first impression 

              is quite strong and that the qualities that attract people to conversion 

              are stable characteristics of ISKCON in Hungary. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">To the question 'What does Krsna Consciousness mean 

              to you?' respondents chose from a list of options given by the researchers: 

              lifestyle (10%), knowledge (61%), belief (60%), security (38%), 

              community (36%), revelation (34%), certainty (32%), sentiments (29%), 

              vocation (17%) and beliefs and rituals (15%). The role of sentiments 

              and personal ties were more important to the pre-initiated. Revelation 

              and vocation were more important to the initiated. Men tended to 

              view the world of Krsna consciousness as being a more rational, 

              operative and practical world, while women found it more spiritual 

              and intimate. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The question 'What is in Krsna Consciousness that 

              is missing from Christianity?' ­eli­cited the following responses: 

              it is easier to understand (33%), more scientific (29%), more authentic 

              (28%), its spirituality is deeper (13%), it is more personal (9%), 

              more practical (8%), and is a better guide (8%). It is perhaps a 

              challenge to those who do not share these beliefs to understand 

              why both the newly converted and the initiated consider this philosophy, 

              which is difficult to translate into a European concept, easier 

              to understand and more scientific than the more familiar Western 

              theology. It may be that people who are searching for reference 

              points and answers anticipate the whole from the parts they understand. 

              Several respondents were attracted by the Vedic stories, which they 

              interpreted literally rather than metaphorically. It should also 

              be borne in mind that within the environment and context of conversion, 

              converts are embraced with love. It is also possible that the respondents 

              took the phrase 'easier to understand' to refer to practice rather 

              than theory; that is, respondents might have regarded this religion 

              as being easier to understand because it appeared more practical.

            <p align="left">Spiritual and mental values rank much higher than 

              material, sensual, emotional and social ones. The suppression of 

              the personality or, as Krsna devotees themselves put it more precisely, 

              'devotedness' is ranked above personality and freedom. If wisdom, 

              impartiality, friendship and happiness had not been highly accepted 

              values, and if interesting life, variety and enjoying one's work 

              had not been chosen by so many, it might be concluded on evidence 

              of the devotees' valuing discipline, obedience and reliability that 

              they are victims of some kind of 'brainwashing'. It is also thought 

              provoking that physical cleanliness is preferred over beauty in 

              nature and the arts, and that not only physical and psychological 

              intimacy but affection and gentleness are rejected. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">In general, men appear to represent a more rational 

              and ascetic version of Krsna consciousness, while women appeared 

              more worldly and less ascetic, despite the fact that obedience is 

              a leading value for them. Married devotees seem to be more independent 

              and freer of prejudices, ranking discipline and politeness lower 

              than freedom, independence and love. On the other hand, the monks 

              appear to be more spiritual, with a preference for impartiality, 

              forgiveness, trustworthiness, happiness and inner harmony. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">A strong similarity was found between Christian and 

              Krsna monks in their acceptance of peace, inner harmony, friendship, 

              responsibility, forgiveness, helping and trustworthiness, as well 

              as in the rejection of wealth and pleasurable life. However, two 

              rather different scales of values have also been identified between 

              the two groups, with the greatest differences seen in the dimensions 

              of independence/obedience and openness/closed-ness. Characteristic 

              values were intelligence and logic for Krsna monks, wisdom for Christians; 

              tidiness and politeness for Krsna monks, beauty for Christians; 

              happiness and contentment for Krsna monks, gentleness for Christians. 

              The values of Krsna monks are more ascetic, established, internal, 

              inflexible and rational. Those of Christian monks are more open, 

              spiritual, dynamic and creative. The values of Christian monks are, 

              in some respects, closer to those of ­Europeans and Hungarians in 

              general, although in the case of politeness, effort, intelligence 

              and logic, the Krsna values are closer. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">It was found that devotees in general were attracted 

              to nature, preferring to spend more time in the natural environment, 

              with many of them desiring to leave the cities. Others considered 

              that being close to nature was an integral part of Vedic culture. 

              For several of them conversion resulted in their changing their 

              view of nature, which they now consider to be a creation of Krsna. 

              However, unsettled and different views were still held regarding 

              body, health and physical culture. For example, on the devotees' 

              scale of values tidiness played an important role (promoting physical 

              culture), but so did asceticism (which pushes physical culture into 

              the background). Physical cleanliness and nourishment were both 

              very important, although the latter was not considered primary. 

              A significant proportion of devotees felt physically overburdened. 

              Before conversion, some of them were active in sports, but this 

              also changed, as Vedic culture considers some sports to be more 

              acceptable than others. </p>

            <p align="left">Apart from their beliefs, the greatest changes in 

              devotees' lives were reported to have occurred in the area of work. 

              After conversion, some devotees terminated their studies and started 

              working; for others, the reverse occurred. Some stopped earning 

              wages to do 'service' (voluntary work on behalf of ISKCON). A number 

              of devotees now undertake mental work instead of physical, whilst 

              others do the opposite. For example, a devotee who was a salesperson 

              before undergoing conversion is now a cook; a devotee who had been 

              a house-painter is now a cowhand; a devotee who had been a businessman 

              before joining ISKCON is now a nurse; a devotee who was a computer 

              specialist is now a business manager; a devotee who had been a university 

              student before undergoing conversion is now an animal farmer; a 

              devotee who was formerly a college student is now a cashier; a former 

              chemist is now a teacher. Seven per cent of respondents felt they 

              were doing their old work better since joining the movement. Several 

              others felt that being a Krsna devotee presented them with the attractive 

              possibility of entrepreneurship. A minority of devotees, especially 

              those who had families or those who would otherwise reject wealth 

              and a pleasurable life, could sense the importance of material goods 

              as tools. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left"><i>Friendship </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">For the devotees, the word 'association' is used as 

              a synonym of 'community', not a term denoting a relationship between 

              two people. Friendship was chosen as one of the most important values 

              by married men (62%) and women waiting for their initiation (54%), 

              but was least important to married women (25%), where possibly the 

              mother-child relationship pushes friendship into the background. 

              With this in mind, it appears rather odd that so few people (11%) 

              chose 'affection and gentility' as a primary value, with three times 

              as many considering it to be one of the least important values. 

              The same people who said 'yes' to friendship as an intimate relationship 

              often said 'no' to love, affection and gentleness. </p>

              There seemed to be a flexible and transitory situation among members

              It should also be borne in mind that in Hungary the number of Vedic 

              weddings has increased significantly recently, and as these couples 

              are at the beginning of their married lives, there is little experience 

              and very few examples to follow. What is certain, though, is that 

              a significant number of uninitiated devotees were uninformed about 

              the physical and affection-based relationships within marriage. 

            </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">It seemed that for Krsna devotees, married love was 

              on the one hand deprived of its mystical and transcendent features 

              and on the other was dealt with in a rather pragmatic way. The practices 

              of choosing a partner and preparing for married life also varied. 

              At one extreme, young people expected the guru to elaborate on and 

              dictate to them the scenario of matchmaking and marrying. At the 

              other, it was the couples themselves who decided to marry and who 

              merely requested the guru's approval. </p>

            <p align="left">The majority (70%) of devotees were not interested 

              in public activities and politics, with women and the pre-initiated 

              showing less interest than men and the initiated in general. Only 

              12% of Krsna monks showed interest in this topic, compared to 71% 

              of Christian monks. Significantly, few of the Hungarian devotee 

              leaders were interested in politics either. Of those devotees who 

              were politically minded, 7% were in sympathy with liberal parties, 

              2% in green parties and 2% in the Socialist Party. There was a marked 

              antipathy against 'nationalists', right-wingers and the so-called 

              Christian parties. (It should be noted that in 1992 and 1993 representatives 

              of those parties labelled the Hare Krsnas a 'destructive sect'.)

              sacred singing and dancing (32%), the company of devotees<i> </i>(29%),

              Hare Krsna festivals (9%), work and study (8%) and eating food offered 

              to Krsna (8%). Most activities mentioned in this category are considered 

              sacred or services to Krsna, particularly by initiated devotees. 

              In this area the difference between Krsna and Christian monks is 

              also significant.<a name="7"></a>[<a href="#7f" class="maintext">7</a>] 

              Christian entertainment is richer in varieties of activities, and 

              the arts and creativity play a much greater role. In answering the 

              question 'What gives pleasure?' most devotees mentioned meals, dancing

              entertainment' is explicitly pleasure. </p>

            <p align="left">While for most Hungarians today television is the 

              primary source of information, a little more than half of the devotees 

              surveyed do not watch it. Of those who did watch television, 50% 

              only watch the news, the other half preferring nature, religious 

              and science programmes and cartoons. Of Krsna monks, 65% did not 

              watch television compared to 30% of Christian monks. Only 15% of 

              Krsna monks watched programmes other than the news, compared to 

              75% of Christian monks. Twenty-four per cent of Hare Krsna respondents 

              did not read anything but school assignments and the sacred Vedic 

              literature. (Of the respondents, 32% were initiated devotees, 16% 

              were uninitiated devotees and 11% were married devotees.) The proportion 

              of those who read various periodicals was 40%, 32% of whom only 

              read daily newspapers. The proportion of those who read books other 

              than devotional literature was 44%. As the level of immersion into 

              Krsna consciousness increased, so the proportion of 'mundane' reading 

              gradually decreased, particularly amongst Krsna monks. The difference 

              between Christian and Krsna monks' reading habits was also quite 

              significant.<a name="8"></a>[<a href="#8f" class="maintext">8</a>] 

              All of the Christian monks surveyed had read literature other than 

              their devotional texts, compared to only 42% of their Krsna counterparts. 

              In addition, 68% of Christian monks had read fiction, whereas none 

              of the Krsna monks surveyed had done so. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">To the question 'What is your attitude towards non-Vedic 

              sciences?' 40% of the answers given were negative. The most frequent 

              comments were as follows: unnecessary or uninteresting (19%), mere 

              speculation (9%), Vedic sciences include everything (8%), these 

              sciences are atheistic (4%), or immoral (3%). A similar proportion 

              of comments showed some further deliberation: good science is what 

              serves Krsna consciousness (10%) or guides you in practical problems 

              (7%). Non-Vedic sciences are only useful when treated critically 

              (7%). Only 10% of the Hare Krsna respondents were positive about 

              science. Initiated devotees' judgment of non-Vedic sciences is more 

              negative. However, the married devotees, who are somewhat closer 

              to the outside world, tolerate non-Vedic sciences slightly more 

              than celibates. Among Krsna monks, the proportion of negative opinions 

              was 68%; 39% were undecided and 3% were positive. With Christian 

              monks, the situation was quite the opposite: 4.4% were negative 

              or undecided and 79% positive. </p>

            <p align="left">While the attitude of most Krsna devotees towards 

              (non-Vedic) sciences was negative, the proportion of negative and 

              positive opinions in relation to the European arts was much more 

              balanced and the scattering of opinions greater. However, the tendency 

              here is similar to 'Information Sources' above: as one progressed 

              in Krsna consciousness, the importance of European arts faded and 

              reservations about them become stronger. However, the arts had a 

              somewhat stronger position among married devotees. Additionally, 

              while the proportion of negative answers among Krsna monks was 90%, 

              none of the Christian monks surveyed expressed negativity towards 

              the arts. </p>

              with five control groups tested for comparison. None of the eleven 

              pieces were liked without reservation by Krsna devotees. The ranking 

              order of the groups in relation to their average approval rate of

            <p align="left">Although there are no great differences, this order 

              is still interesting. To all indications, the Hare Krsna devotees' 

              faith and values seemed to have played a significant role when evaluating 

              the poems. It is also interesting to note that none of the poems 

              were completely rejected, leading to the cautious assumption that 

              European literature has not yet been completely shut out from the 

              minds of Hungarian devotees. </p>

              Her name is Mrs Wolf. Note it well: Mrs Wolf. Mrs Wolf. Mrs Wolf. 

            </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The related question read: 'Why do you think Mrs Wolf's 

              name is to be noted?' Twenty-four per cent of respondents could 

              not or would not answer. According to 27%, Mrs Wolf's name is not 

              to be noted because she is a nobody, because she is a machine, because 

              she is materialistic, because she is unhappy, because only Krsna's 

              name is to be noted, because Mrs Wolf's life is purposeless. Only 

              26% said her name is to be noted - because her life is senseless, 

              because it is a warning example, because she is responsible for 

              shaping her life, because she represents the average Hungarian fate, 

              because her work is valuable, because she is pitiful, because she 

              is a non-person, because she is unique, because she represents the 

              materialistic world. Three per cent of respondents believe that 

              Mrs Wolf can only be rescued by Krsna consciousness. A few years 

              ago several hundred Hungarian citizens were asked the same question. 

              At that time the proportion of those who were unable to answer the 

              question was the highest among children and those with a low level 

              of education (15-25%). With Krsna devotees this proportion was also 

              rather high (24%). The answer 'not to be noted' was on the average 

              twice as high among Krsna devotees as it was with other groups. 

            </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Compared to other groups, devotees' negative judgment 

              of Mrs Wolf or her situation was quite frequent. Many considered 

              her life purposeless and held her responsible for her failure. Only 

              a minority were sorry for her, or considered her or her job valuable. 

              It is striking that unmarried initiated devotees were much more 

              strict and judgmental, with uninitiated and married devotees largely 

              acknowledging her positive features. Although a slightly higher 

              proportion of men considered her a warning example, it was the women 

              who considered her insignificant, her life senseless and who looked 

              upon her as a machine (although they also saw her unhappiness).

            <p align="left">There is a sharp contrast in the reaction of Krsna 

              and Christian monks. Only 8% of the Christian monks were unable 

              to answer, compared to 19% of Krsna monks. While 51% of the Krsna 

              monks felt that Mrs Wolf's name is not to be noted, only 4% of Christian 

              monks shared this opinion. Typical answers in the two groups were

            <p align="left">Rather different ways of thinking, different values 

              and dispositions manifest themselves here, but in this instance 

              it is a factor that Christian monks had a greater knowledge of the 

              specific language of <i>belles-lettres </i>than their Krsna counterparts.

            <p align="left">Ten years ago a survey was undertaken on methods of 

              evaluation and interpretation of the Tarkovksky film <i>Stalker</i> 

              (which presents the transcendent) for several groups consisting 

              of church-religious, independent religious, non-religious believers/God-seekers, 

              persons who were ideologically neutral, and atheists. It was found 

              that deep religiosity and church-religiosity increased the chances 

              of 'true' reception, and resulted in deeper, more adequate interpretations, 

              although such groups were unable to balance this with their lack 

              of experience with the language of film. Therefore religiousness 

              in itself is no guarantee of adequate evaluation and interpretation 

              of a piece of art representing the transcendent. This film was seen 

              by approximately forty Krsna devotees (in three sessions), twenty-eight 

              of whom subsequently completed an evaluation questionnaire. Two 

              separate discussion sessions were also held after the film. The 

              results obtained from the questionnaires and discussions were then 

              compared with the reactions of the church-religious group from the 

              previous study. Although in general the Christian group preferred 

              the film more, approximately three quarters of devotees also expressed 

              their approval, with initiated men liking it more than women and 

              uninitiated devotees. The majority of ISKCON devotees who either 

              rejected the film or had reservations about it thought it was too 

              slow and difficult to understand. There is a considerable similarity 

              between the reactions of the two religious groups, but substantial 

              differences too. It seems that Christians were more cathartically 

              affected by the film than the Krsna devotees; significant differences 

              were found in the categories 'I was moved by the film', 'it has 

              told me something', and 'it revealed new relationships'. However, 

              the film was received more warmly by Krsna devotees than were the 

              poems. Concepts such as pilgrimage, teacher, people disappointed 

              in materialistic life, or Western world, faith and its insufficiency 

              might have been reasonably familiar to ISKCON devotees who, for 

              this reason, may have felt fairly at home in this world. If this 

              is so, they may have been able to tune into a familiar story and 

              identify with the characters. Some Krsna conscious viewers may indeed 

              have switched off rational thinking, put reasoning aside and, voluntarily 

              or involuntarily, joined in the world of the film. On the basis 

              of this film, a discussion took place on the differences between 

              Vedic and European culture and universal arts. <i>Stalker</i> helped 

              the Krsna devotees become immersed in their own faith and while 

              talking about the film; they were able to put into words something 

              about themselves and their beliefs that had barely come to the surface 

              during previous interviews (which otherwise almost always appeared 

              sincere). It was thus demonstrated that bridges can be built between 

              these two cultures. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">It is difficult to predict what traces the inattention 

              to European arts and sciences will leave in the shaping of a Hare 

              Krsna devotee's identity. One or two years after conversion they 

              may not have either enough experience or enough knowledge of Vedic 

              arts and Vedic knowledge. The vast majority of Hungarian Krsna devotees 

              considered European culture more fragmented than Vedic culture; 

              some of them thought it could be ignored whereas others believed 

              it could be integrated into Vedic culture.[<a href="#10f" class="maintext">10</a>]<a name="10"></a>

            <p align="left">To the question 'What do you consider valuable and 

              respectable in the Christian religion?' only 10% of Hare Krsna respondents 

              answered negatively. The majority mentioned Jesus (32%), belief 

              in God (12%), the Bible (8%) and love (7%). Their image of Christianity 

              was by no means hostile, and was even positive, especially the views 

              expressed by initiated devotees. However, the answers also indicated 

              that devotees sympathise with fundamental Christian principles and 

              teachings rather than the Church and current Christian practices. 

              It was clear that in addition to their own negative experiences, 

              an unsophisticated interpretation of ­Prabhupada's ideas had strongly 

              influenced devotees' opinions about Christian faith and practices, 

              especially among recent converts. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>The Hungarian factor </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">One aspect of the interviews dealt with the relationship 

              between Vedic and Hungarian culture, or how it was possible for 

              someone to be both a Hungarian national and a devotee. One answer 

              was that the prevailing culture was not Hungarian at all but ­American. 

              Another approach was to consider that a devotee of Krsna was 'first 

              a soul and only then a ­Hungarian'. A third group considered 'Hungarian-ness' 

              insignificant. A fourth view acknowledged that there is a Hungarian 

              soul, or more specifically, Hungarian <i>karma</i>. In this view, 

              to be both Hungarian and a devotee is a special challenge, and such 

              individuals were not born in ­Hungary by chance. There was a fifth 

              opinion that maintained it was possible to combine or connect the 

              two features. It is difficult to say to what degree devotees are 

              'Vedic cosmopolitan', since many displayed a looser relationship 

              with their Hungarian identity before than after conversion. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>How ISKCON devotees see the future </i></p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Aside from the leadership, very few ISKCON devotees 

              have a precise prediction or elaborate image of the future, or even 

              an individual life-plan; what they may have is a non-articulated 

              optimistic idea of the future. Many of them believe that, as opposed 

              to countries east or west of Hungary, Krsna consciousness has a 

              particularly good chance to spread in their country. In most of 

              their visions of the future, Krsna Valley appears as 'the future 

              in the present.' There are some who think that a genuine, beautiful 

              future is only possible in the 'golden age', when the whole world 

              will become Krsna conscious. Others expect difficulties in the near 

              future, a rough path. However, they still cannot conceive of anything 

              better than Krsna consciousness. Several devotees think that in 

              today's Hungary there is a serious need for a spiritual change. 

              Some believe, as did the first initiated Hungarian devotee, that 

              'things begin to be corrected, start being realised, start operating 

              according to the place and the time. Although this system remains 

              Vedic, it will gradually lose the features brought from India, will 

              start being integrated into Hungarian realities'. There are some 

              who think that 'Krsna consciousness is made for Hungarians, this 

              is why it has a future here'. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Future developments</i> </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">When Max Weber made a distinction between asceticism 

              rejecting the world and asceticism adjusting to the world, he stated 

              that the salvation methodology of India is a typical example of 

              mystical contemplation running away from the world, while Calvinism 

              is an example of asceticism that is willing to stay and act in the 

              world. In the West, mystical religiousness turns into ascetic virtue, 

              and even contemplation cannot prevent the predominance of activity. 

              Oriental contemplative mysticism is not an instrument of God but 

              a receptacle of God, and thus avoids activity. The contemplative 

              mystic looks at the activity inside the world as a temptation, against 

              which the state of grace must be preserved, and so activity decreases 

              to a minimum. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Krsna consciousness is a form of asceticism that in 

              some way adjusts to the world but at the same time rejects it. It 

              is located somewhere on the borderline between Oriental contemplation 

              and Western asceticism (which works to change the world as God's 

              instrument), and can be characterised by the features of both. The 

              salvation methodology of Krsna devotees who act, distribute books 

              and preach closely resembles Western asceticism, which propagates 

              salvation. F. J. Daner saw as early as 1976 that Krsna consciousness 

              (which accepts and embraces marginal people) also helps their reintegration 

              (as a subculture) within society. Daner called the Hare Krsna movement 

              the counter-culture of counter-culture. It remains open to speculation 

              as to which direction the Society will move in the future. The march 

              out from major cities to Krsna Valley does not yet mean a shift 

              in its mystical-contemplative direction. It is a question of how 

              many devotees will become unaccustomed to adventure, creativity, 

              asking, risk-taking, trusting, and external and internal freedom 

              because of the shelter (which protects them from the chaos) and 

              the guru (who thinks and makes decisions for many of them and whose 

              leadership provides security). </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">A religion with a broader horizon and an intention 

              to adjust to the world does not mean a compromise with the world, 

              nor does it mean giving up fundamentalism and a black-and-white 

              judgment of the world. However, it may result - and this process 

              is visible in Hungary - in a broader understanding of the terms 

              'devotee' and 'member' that can lead to, on the one hand, a watering 

              down of original rules and, on the other, qualitative discrimination 

              of members in different life-situations and commitments. One might 

              perhaps gain the impression that, similar to Orwell's <i>Animal 

              Farm</i>, some devotees may be more equal than others (this privileged 

              group being the monks, while those who do not observe all the regulations 

              but are active in the temple community remain in the outside circle). 

              It is a key question as to whether or not it will be possible in 

              the future to be a fully-fledged Hare Krsna devotee while maintaining 

              looser ties with the movement. If it is possible perhaps many more 

              people would be encouraged to join, and former devotees might re-join, 

              the Society. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">In ISKCON Hungary there is obvious institutionalisation. 

              However, counter-processes have also begun with the creation of 

              small communities (cells) outside of the temples. It is not known 

              yet how much this institutionalisation will affect the attractive 

              intimate atmosphere and individual features of the temples and <i>a</i><i>s</i><i>ramas</i>, 

              and whether these cells will become bases of a family-oriented communal 

              life and of grass-roots initiatives or will simply turn into the 

              enforcement squads of the organisation. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Another important issue is how much weight Krsna Valley 

              will have in the shaping of Krsna consciousness in Hungary. One 

              can now meet three rather different models of devotees in Hungary: 

              the monk preaching at the busiest points of a city; the devotee 

              looked upon as some sort of tourist attraction; and the devotee 

              more or less adjusting to society, undertaking employment, praying 

              at home, going to the temple on Sundays and demonstrating some alternative 

              lifestyle. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The future of Krsna consciousness in Hungary will 

              to a large extent be determined by the embodiment of the guru, or 

              at least, what kind of guru image will live in devotees: the demigod; 

              the respected father; the older friend; the fellow-devotee with 

              whom one can have a discussion; the guru who approves desires and 

              initiatives; or the guru who dictates. On the basis of the present 

              scale of values it seems that the majority needs, or at least tolerates, 

              the latter. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The status of women in the movement could easily become 

              another major issue. The shaping of the Hungarian situation could 

              be further affected by the importance and justification of the intimate 

              sphere, personal life and individual characteristics. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The development of communication skills is another 

              significant factor. Communication between ISKCON devotees and the 

              man on the street and representatives of the sciences and other 

              religions is far from being problem-free. ISKCON devotees in Hungary 

              will have to give some thought to the fact that a dialogue with 

              the latter two may be just as constructive as, if not more than, 

              friendly smiles. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">Prevailing circumstances and the quality of ISKCON 

              intellectuals are also keys to the future. It is difficult to predict 

              whether the Society will be more reliant on serving specialists 

              or if they will need intellectuals who think autonomously (within 

              obvious limits), who are critical, willing to reinterpret even the 

              sacred scriptures and to take an anti-fundamentalist position. It 

              seems inevitable that the intelligentsia of Vedic culture in Hungary 

              and the rest of Europe, will become the intelligentsia of European 

              culture insofar as the Krsna consciousness movement desires to be 

              a scholarly mission (as it would appear). </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">What measure of compromise will develop between Vaisnavas 

              and the Western narrative? How much will devotees heed Gandhi's 

              warning that 'to swim in the waters of tradition is good, but to 

              drown in them is suicide'? Harvey Cox (Gelberg p. 276) may be correct 

              in his summation that the scriptures must be reinterpreted no matter 

              what dangers this might pose, since it is a greater danger not to 

              reinterpret and adapt them to different historical and cultural 

              contexts. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">In addition, Sharma (pp. 220-39) raises another critical 

              factor in asking what kind of relationship and attitude ISKCON will 

              maintain in relation to global problems. According to Gyula Molnar, 

              the Western world is in a serious modernisation crisis, along with 

              its cultural and church structures. Modernisation is nothing more 

              than removing the most serious dangers of development and turning 

              development into progress. The focus of the crisis is in the West, 

              which is why the Hare Krsna movement was able to take root there. 

              One has to face this crisis, and it is often said that if you cannot 

              prevent something then try to take the lead in it. However, it would 

              appear that devotees are presently unable to do this. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">The ultimate challenge for ISKCON is 'inculturation', 

              the ability to establish an 'intimate' relationship with European 

              and Hungarian culture. Referring to ancient Hungarian culture as 

              closely resembling that of Vedic culture seems as questionable and 

              risky as using the example of UFOs to support the validity of Vedic 

              culture. In comparison, a radical alienation from the dominant culture 

              is rather alien to the Christian way of thinking. Indeed, the history 

              of Christianity illustrates the conviction that the reason it became 

              dominant is because Jesus worked through the existing culture whereas, 

              according to Thomas Robbins (Robbins pp. 77-84), the Hare Krsna 

              movement today has a tendency to oppose Western culture. He adds 

              that this tendency may change in the future, since if a devotee 

              is allowed to drive a decorated carriage, why should he not also 

              be allowed to drive a truck and sing Country and Western songs? 

              On the basis of current attitudes, the Hare Krsna movement is not 

              a layperson's religion, and American culture is intolerant to intolerance, 

              as is that of Hungary. Robbins perceives ISKCON as an interesting 

              mix of relativism and absolutism, and believes one should not entertain 

              great hopes of a quick and successful cultural adaptation, since 

              Western moral principles are simply considered illusions by devotees 

              and eccentricity is permitted although it seals them off from the 

              surrounding culture. On the other hand, D. F. Gordon, after noting 

              the signs of an easing in the absoluteness and an increase in ISKCON's 

              cultural adaptation, asks, with a surprising turn, what would remain 

              of the movement if its intolerance to Western culture ceased, citing 

              Chesterton who considered tolerance the virtue of those who do not 

              believe in anything. </p>

            <p align="left"></p>

            <p align="left">At the end of his 1974 book about ISKCON, Gordon compares 

              the movement to a new-born phoenix which was not yet clear as to 

              which direction it would fly. Well, this Arabian bird did get to 

              a lot of places, including Hungary. And it is still flying. It is 

              frequently fired upon, but it was born in fire anyway. What is it 

              that keeps it up there? The answer is the belief of the Hare Krsna 

              community in all those places, including Hungary. Hopefully, this 

              survey will act as map and a useful reference point for the bird 

              to follow. </p>

              hard rock was replaced by Krsna music of similar style, <i>prasadam

              The pre-initiated male monks rejected it the most vehemently (68%), 

              while married men rejected it the least. In general, married devotees 

              rejected it less than celibates, but women did not reject it less 

              than men. </p>

              Some believe that the married devotees who observe the rules should 

              be considered <i>brahmacaris</i> and <i>brahmacarinis</i>, and sometimes 

              it is even said that living in a Krsna conscious family means a 

              similar sacrifice as <i>sannyasa</i>. Others believe that being 

              a monk is a higher level. </p>

              In 1997, the current President of the National Council said that

              on the harmonious relationship with European and Hungarian culture.
