            <span class="maintextsubhead">Author: Steven Pressfield <br>

            Publisher: Bantam Books, London, 2001 <br>

            ISBN: 0-553-81307-2 </span> 

            <p>Steven Pressfield's <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> is a novelised 

              retelling of <i>Bhagavad-gita. </i>The heroes of the novel are Rannulph 

              Junah (R. Junah, representing Arjuna) and Bagger Vance (representing 

              Bhagavan, Krsna). </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Having heard a little of this book before it landed on my desk, 

              I was fearing a slavish re-presentation of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              in which the gurus become golf coaches and the conch shells become 

              golf clubs. This isn't the case, <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance </i>has 

              its own story to tell, which in itself has various benefits and 

              pitfalls. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In short, the story is that of Rannulph Junah, veteran of the First 

              World War, who bears physical and psychic scars from his experiences. 

              Junah is steamrolled into representing his hometown in a championship 

              golf match and in the process becomes enlightened by the instructions 

              of his guide and friend, Bagger Vance, who has also agreed to be 

              his caddie. Readers of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> will already begin to 

              see the parallels and differences between the two texts. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>From my reading I could gather three levels of correspondence between 

              the two books. First of all there were the clear parallels: The 

              names of the central characters; the division of the philosophy 

              into discipline, wisdom and love (<i>karma</i>, <i>jnana</i> and 

              <i>bhakti</i>); Junah's acceptance of Bagger Vance as guru; Junah 

              ordering Bagger Vance to drive his car between the massed armies 

              (of golf fans), where he laments: 'What good will any of it do me, 

              or anyone attached to it?' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The second level was more suggestive. The general commotion before 

              the big match suggested the tumult before the battle of Kuruksetra; 

              Junah's stance of not wanting to carry the fight echoes that of 

              Arjuna but contains very different reasoning; and the narrator is 

              suggestive of <i>Bhagavad-gita's</i> narrator, Sanjaya, in that 

              he is fully witness to events that other spectators are not; however, 

              he plays a more active part in the story than does Sanjaya. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The third level is one of no correspondence. Our first encounter 

              with Junah is as a dead-drunk semi-recluse haunted by personal ghosts 

              - not really Arjuna at all. Vance's tale about the golf course being 

              the site of a battle on the Land of Mu, 21,000 years ago, didn't 

              ring any familiar bells either. These are not necessarily criticisms. 

              The author has his own stories to tell - as appropriate for a novel 

              - but it does raise questions about the philosophical content. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Generally in Indian traditions, texts such as <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 

              are understood through ­<i>parampara </i>(a succession of gurus 

              and disciples). This system attaches great importance to the idea 

              that knowledge is handed down from guru to disciple, who himself 

              becomes guru and hands down that knowledge unchanged but explained 

              according to contemporary conditions. Novelists, on the other hand, 

              attach great importance to the idea that whatever enhances the story 

              is fair game. Therefore we wouldn't expect philosophical rigour 

              to stand in the way of a good story. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>These waters are further muddied by the fact that there are many 

              different schools of interpretation of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> from 

              which Pressfield could draw. While traditional Indian methods may 

              lead to finding the one teacher who explains it best, Western minds 

              are more inclined to look at the many explanations and try and understand 

              selectively. This means in practice that one is never sure which 

              school, if any, Pressfield is representing on any particular point 

              or if he is importing philosophies from wherever it suits him (as 

              is his right as a fiction writer). This license seemed to be most 

              employed in his various expositions on the Authentic Swing. At times 

              it read like a beginner's <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>(discipline, wisdom 

              and love) while at others it contained a more homemade philosophy 

              (golf as a metaphor for the search for identity). </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The author does make some basic points very nicely: the idea of 

              stripping away external designations in an effort to discover the 

              self, for example. Bagger Vance instructs: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Are you your roles, Junah? Scion, soldier, Southerner? Husband, 

                father, lover? Slayer of the foe in battle, comforter of the friend 

                at home? Are you your virtues, Junah, or your sins? Your deeds, 

                your feats? Are you your dreams or your nightmares? Tell me, Junah. 

                Can you hit the ball with any of these? </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>More problematic, from a Vaisnava perspective, are the occasional 

              brushes with impersonalism. What happens when all these designations 

              are stripped away? According to Vance and Junah: 'There's nothing 

              left'. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I only played golf once and found it boring and frustrating, so 

              I was a little apprehensive about reading a 'golf' novel. However, 

              these sections were written with such enthusiasm and skill that 

              the latent sports fan was soon immersed in the world of mashies 

              and niblicks (whatever they might be) with a genuine interest in 

              what would happen at the next hole. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>This is a well-written novel, not <i>Bhagavad-gita for Beginners</i> 

              or <i>A ­Golfer's Companion to Bhagavad-gita</i>. I would not recommend 

              it to anyone wanting to learn about <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> but would 

              happily recommend it to anyone who likes a little thoughtfulness 

              in his or her novels. I would particularly recommend it to anyone 

              who needs a sugar-coated introduction to the idea that there is 

              more to life than matter. </p>
