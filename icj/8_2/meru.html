            <p><i>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are basic human 

              rights and form one of the main pillars of a democratic society. 

              But how free are Europe's citizens to choose and practice their 

              own beliefs? In this article Merudevi Dasi examines the history 

              and implications of policies towards new religious movements (NRMs) 

              in Europe, specifically France. Currently the French government 

              is considering controversial new legislation that many fear will 

              severely curtail the rights of religious minorities. Does this law 

              challenge the European Union's commitment to religious freedom? 

              Will other European countries follow the French model or will France 

              become isolated on this issue?</i> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 

              This is guaranteed in several legal documents, most importantly 

              in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) 

              (UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 

              Rights (ICCPR), and Article 9 of the European Convention on Human 

              Rights (ECHR). These articles allow us to hold any beliefs we desire, 

              whether they are theistic, non-theistic or atheistic. The right 

              to manifest these freedoms is only restricted in order to protect 

              the fundamental rights of others. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The emergence of 'new religious movements' (NRMs) in the West since 

              the 1960s has put these articles to the test. Are all expressions 

              of faith acceptable in our society, and how should we react to them? 

              European countries have chosen to interpret freedom of religion 

              and belief in diverse ways, and have adopted different strategies 

              on how to deal with these NRMs. In this article we look at some 

              of the developments in Europe in this regard, particularly in France. 

              France is by no means unique in its approach towards NRMs, but it 

              is well ahead in introducing restrictive legislation against them. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>According to Abdelfattah Amor, the Special Rapporteur on Religious 

              Intolerance at the UN Commission on Human Rights, while Western 

              Europe has previously been exemplary in the development of international 

              and regional norms and mechanisms to protect religious freedom, 

              its present practice is unsatisfactory. This was Amor's opening 

              message at a UNESCO meeting in Paris earlier this year. He spoke 

              at the conference 'Human Rights and Freedom of Religion: Practices 

              in Western Europe', which was attended by many experts in the field. 

              Amor commented that many religious and spiritual communities 'have 

              been labelled as cults by parliamentary reports or inter-ministerial 

              commissions', and that 'this generalisation and amalgamation' has 

              led to a situation where 'movements that are perfectly respectable 

              and sometimes very ancient' are finding themselves in the same category 

              as 'cheaters and criminals'.<a name="1"></a>[<a href="#1f" class="maintext">1</a>] 

              It is a common argument among those who oppose 'new religions' that 

              these are not <i>de facto</i> religions but mundane movements hiding 

              behind a religious label. That may be true about some groups, but 

              it becomes problematic when a large number of<i> </i>religious and 

              spiritual groups are put into that category without thorough research 

              on the matter. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>When looking at the right to religious freedom and who holds that 

              right, it is useful to look at the UN Human Rights Committee's interpretation 

              of Article 18 of the ICCPR.<a name="2"></a>[<a href="#2f" class="maintext">2</a>] 

              Their explanation of Article 18.1 is as follows: </p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>The terms 'belief' and 'religion' are to be broadly construed. 

                Article 18 is not limited in its application to traditional religions 

                or to religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics 

                or practices analogous to those of traditional religions. The 

                Committee therefore views with concern any tendency to discriminate 

                against any religion or belief for any reason, including the fact 

                that they are newly established, or represent religious minorities 

                that may be the subject of hostility on the part of a predominant 

                religious community.[<a href="#3f" class="maintext">3</a>]<a name="3"></a></p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Article 18.1 is only subjected to limitations that are 'prescribed 

              by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, 

              or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others' and 

              'must not be applied in a manner that would vitiate the rights guaranteed 

              in Article 18'. This implies that the clause on religious freedom 

              is very broad, and any restrictions or policies to restrict this 

              freedom should be pursued very carefully. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In the 1970s, NRMs, often derogatively called 'cults' or 'sects', 

              were met with much suspicion and fear. In the US and Europe, 'anti-cult' 

              groups emerged as a reaction to the anger and concerns of some parents 

              of new adherents. Early on, anti-cult groups adopted the theory 

              of 'brainwashing' as an explanation for people joining these NRMs 

              and soon took on 'de-programming' as a way to reverse the brainwashing. 

              The anti-cult movements are now of a wide variety, and have since 

              changed some of their methods. For instance, 'de-programming', and 

              attendant behaviour such as kidnapping, have been replaced with 

              'exit-counselling'. (Langone pp. 175-9) The brainwashing or mental 

              manipulation theory, although still prevalent, has become more sophisticated. 

              (Langone pp. 85-122) Although anti-cultists have lost their influence 

              in the US, they are still strong in some Western ­European countries 

              and have entered the political arena through successful lobbying 

              and media attention. The perspective of anti-cultists appeals to 

              some parts of the media due to their simplistic and sensationalist 

              nature. If the media's portrayals of NRMs are sufficiently frequent 

              and upsetting, the pressure mounts on legislators to respond. (Wilson 

              p. 111) In Europe, several governments and pan-European parliaments 

              have brought the issue of NRMs into their political agenda, and 

              most countries have at least discussed it or have prepared written 

              reports on this topic. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>France 1994-6 </b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Although the issue of NRMs has been the subject of political debates 

              for many years in Europe, it was not until the suicide cases in 

              the Solar Temple Order[<a href="#4f" class="maintext">4</a>]<a name="4"></a> 

              - in Switzerland and Canada in 1994 and France in 1995 - that the 

              wheels really started to turn. In June 1995 the National Assembly 

              in France established a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission. It held 

              secret hearings with the help of the anti-cult organisation the 

              Association for the Defense of the Family and the Individual (ADFI),[<a href="#5f" class="maintext">5</a>]<a name="5"></a> 

              and published its report 22 January 1995. The Gest-Guyard Report,[<a href="#6f" class="maintext">6</a>]<a name="6"></a> 

              as it was called (Gest was the president of the committee, Guyard 

              the rapporteur), was unable to give a definition for a sect but 

              identified characteristics of groups that would suggest that they 

              were sects. These characteristics included mental destabilisation, 

              exorbitant financial demands, the splitting of families, anti-social 

              behaviour, disturbing the public, and attempts to infiltrate organs 

              of the State. They described sects as groups that, by definition, 

              are not religious but hide themselves behind philosophical, religious 

              or therapeutic terms to reach their goal of power and control over 

              their followers. Applying these criteria, the report listed 173 

              'sects'. The commission recommended the creation of an organisation 

              that would study the phenomenon of sects, inform the government, 

              and present proposals on how to better fight sects. They did not, 

              however, see the need for new legislation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The report was criticised by scholars in the field of sociology, 

              religious history, law, and other disciplines. They did not oppose 

              the attempt at writing a report on the issue but questioned its 

              accuracy and methodology. They found that the report failed to distinguish 

              between the groups and that the information and definitions were 

              vague and out of date. It was also felt that use was not made of 

              readily available resource materials from scholars in the field 

              and that a prejudicial definition of the word 'sect' was used. The 

              list of sects was also considered inaccurate and misleading. (Boyle 

              p. 302) It is worth noting that no scholar of religion was invited 

              to contribute to this report, nor were any of the listed groups 

              heard by the Commission. A book was also published shortly after 

              the report was completed[<a href="#7f" class="maintext">7</a>]<a name="7"></a> 

              containing comments from internationally renowned scholars in the 

              field. The media storm that followed the report did not give the 

              scholars much exposure. The sensational sect lists naturally had 

              greater appeal. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Europe's response 1997-9 </b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Shortly after France published its report 'Sects in France', Belgium 

              produced its own.[<a href="#8f" class="maintext">8</a>]<a name="8"></a> 

              It listed 189 groups as sects, and its report was seen as even more 

              extreme than that produced by France. The list had to be withdrawn 

              due to the unfavourable reaction it met when it was discovered that 

              it labelled Opus Dei (a Catholic group aimed at re-establishing 

              ­Christian ideals in society), the YWCA and other well-established 

              groups as sects.[<a href="#9f" class="maintext">9</a>]<a name="9"></a>In 

              June 1998 ­Germany also produced a report, the final version of 

              which proved milder than expected. The German report did not call 

              for new legislation and asked for the usage of the term 'sect' to 

              be discontinued due to its stigmatising effect. However, it continued 

              to label the Church of Scientology as a 'political-extremist' group. 

              (Wilson p. 230) </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The European Parliament was also approached during this period 

              of parliamentary reports. It began discussing the idea of establishing 

              a centre for information and cooperation between member states attempting 

              to deal with sects. Maria Berger, MEP from Austria, did not think 

              a European observatory necessary, and her report of December 1997[<a href="#10f" class="maintext">10</a>]<a name="10"></a> 

              was quite mild, although ambiguous. Her report was accepted in the 

              committee but sent back and so never came before the assembly. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The next parliamentary body to be approached was the Council of 

              Europe. Adrian Nàstase, a Romanian MP, prepared a report entitled 

              'Illegal Activities of Sects', which, after amendment, was adopted 

              by the parliamentary assembly on 22 June 1999. It is seen as a compromised 

              report but does recommend member states 'to encourage an approach 

              to new religious groups which will bring about understanding, tolerance, 

              dialogue and resolution of conflicts'.[<a href="#11f" class="maintext">11</a>]<a name="11"></a> 

              The report recommends the formation of national and European observatories, 

              but clearly states that they should be independent. (France, Belgium 

              and Austria, all have observatories under the jurisdiction of their 

              governments.) </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The Swedish government also began to prepare a report during this 

              period. It started with a draft called 'Destructive Sects'. After 

              some parliamentary discussion, it was agreed that the role of a 

              rapporteur was to ascertain any need for support by ex-members of 

              NRMs. The rapporteur held separate hearings with anti-cult groups, 

              scholars and members of NRMs. She also visited NRMs and travelled 

              to other countries to meet scholars, anti-cult groups and parliamentary 

              commissions. From this work came the report 'In Good Faith' in September 

              1998, which recommended open dialogue as an efficient approach towards 

              NRMs. They believed this 'would be beneficial for religious liberty 

              and religious diversity as well as improving vigilance against deviance'.[<a href="#12f" class="maintext">12</a>]<a name="12"></a> 

              The Swedish report looked at the issue of NRMs from different angles, 

              and contains separate chapters on religious psychology and research 

              on NRMs, international experiences, effects on psychological health, 

              children in NRMs, and independent religious schools. It also looked 

              at the issue from a judicial perspective. On surveying the international 

              scene, it was observed that this whole discussion was in general 

              very polarised; one is either seen as for or against NRMs. Scholars 

              are sometimes perceived as being bought by rich NRMs; anti-cult 

              groups and NRMs are rife with suspicion against and between each 

              other; and the whole issue is 'infested with slander, half-truths, 

              and exaggerations'. They advised the Swedish government not to enter 

              this 'infected' area and recommended dialogue as a positive solution. 

              They noted the differences of approach between European countries 

              - France, Belgium and the Canton of Geneva had chosen to 'go hard' 

              against NRMs, whilst Italy, Denmark and, to some extent, England 

              had chosen a more accommodating approach, and had not experienced 

              any problems with NRMs. </p>

            <p><b>France continues: 1996-9</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Among the European countries, France is seen to be setting up the 

              most repressive measures against NRMs. It is therefore interesting 

              to study the developments in France over the past six years. Just 

              after the Gest-Guyard report was completed in 1996, the French Prime 

              ­Minister created the 'Observatory on Sects' to collect information 

              and advise the government on the subject of NRMs. This organisation 

              was dissolved in 1998 and MILS (Mission interministrerielle de lutte 

              contre les sectes, the Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against 

              Sects) was created under the presidency of Alain Vivien,[<a href="#13f" class="maintext">13</a>]<a name="13"></a> 

              the former Minister of Foreign Affairs. The duty of MILS was to 

              analyse the sect phenomenon, to inform the public of the danger 

              of sects, and to coordinate all government meetings regarding NRMs. 

              The Mission keeps in close contact with the anti-cult groups CCMM 

              (Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales [Centre Against Mental 

              Manipulation]) and UNADFI. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The Minister of Justice sent out a circular to the prosecutors 

              in 1996, just after the Gest-Guyard report. It encouraged prosecutors 

              to bring charges against NRMs and included a list of the 173 blacklisted 

              NRMs from the report. A second circular[<a href="#14f" class="maintext">14</a>]<a name="14"></a> 

              was sent out in December 1998, urging state prosecutors to do the 

              following: </p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>(1)    establish a relationship with anti-cult groups, especially 

                UNADFI and CCMM, </p>

              <p>(2)    designate a prosecutor in each region to handle any matters 

                in relation to 'sects', and </p>

              <p>(3)    institute meetings between officials - including prosecutors, 

                police, employment services, social services, customs, educational 

                services, youth and sport services - to enhance cooperation between 

                them and the mission against NRMs. </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>In 1999 the National Assembly initiated a new parliamentary inquiry 

              commission to investigate the finances of NRMs. The commission, 

              led by Jacques Guyard (president) and Jean-Pierre Brard (rapporteur), 

              both members of MILS, produced 'Finances and Sects', a report on 

              the economical state of affairs in 60 NRMs. When Guyard made this 

              report public, a reporter asked him why Anthroposophy (founded by 

              Rudolf Steiner) was added to the list of sects. Guyard's reply was: 

              'It's a typical one. All these movements are first of all alluring, 

              and then their principal objective is revealed to be either the 

              misuse of funds or the abuse of absolute power over people. [...] 

              Here, indoctrination is a clear fact'. As a result of this report, 

              Guyard was called to defend himself in court. He lost the case and 

              had to pay a fine of FF20,000 plus FF90,000 in damages. The reason 

              for the judgement was that Guyard could not give any substantial 

              proof for his statements. None of the complainants or members of 

              Anthroposophy were heard by the Commission, resulting in Guyard's 

              evidence being rejected by the judge as unsubstantial. She also 

              found the insult a significant offence, because it was made by a 

              Deputy President of the Commission, 'whose authority and competence 

              could not be in doubt by the public'.[<a href="#15f" class="maintext">15</a>]<a name="15"></a>

            <p><b>France works toward legislation </b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>At the time of writing this article, the French Parliament is preparing 

              a controversial piece of legislation.[<a href="#16f" class="maintext">16</a>]<a name="16"></a> 

              The draft law, 'Law proposal aiming at reinforcing the prevention 

              and the repression against groups with a sectarian character',[<a href="#17f" class="maintext">17</a>]<a name="17"></a> 

              will be part of the French criminal code if the Senate and the National 

              Assembly agree to a common proposal. It has aroused serious concern 

              within government bodies, human rights organisations and religious 

              groups. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The origin of this legislation is a proposal from Senator Nicolas 

              About,[<a href="#18f" class="maintext">18</a>]<a name="18"></a> 

              unanimously adopted by the Senate at its first reading on 16 December 

              1999. Senator About proposed that groups of a sectarian nature be 

              included in a 1936 law that allows the dissolution of private militias 

              and combat groups by presidential decree. Under this law, the president 

              would have the power to dissolve groups he considers sectarian in 

              the same way that he can dissolve private militias and combat groups 

              if they or their leaders are convicted more than once for certain 

              crimes; and if they create public disorder, or are considered a 

              major threat to the public or the State. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>When the draft law came before the National Assembly, Mrs Catherine 

              Picard, a ­Socialist MP, substantially modified it,[<a href="#19f" class="maintext">19</a>]<a name="19"></a> 

              changing the procedure of dissolution by a presidential decree to 

              a judicial procedure and making the law part of the criminal code, 

              instead coming under the 1936 law. Prior to the voting in the National 

              Assembly on 22 June 2000, Picard commented that the changes were 

              to 'strengthen the responsibility of the corporate entity, make 

              it more difficult to reconstitute organisations dissolved by the 

              law, establish stricter rules to govern the location and publicity 

              of organisations, and define, finally, the crime of mental manipulation'. 

              The proposal was unanimously accepted, with amendments, by the eighteen 

              members present at the plenary session.[<a href="#20f" class="maintext">20</a>]<a name="20"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Elisabeth Guigou, the Minister of Justice, called the bill 'a significant 

              advance, giving a democratic state a legal tool to efficiently fight 

              groups abusing its core values'.[<a href="#21f" class="maintext">21</a>]<a name="21"></a> 

              However, she also recommended a pause before the legislation went 

              before the Senate for its second vote, so that human right organisations 

              and church groups could submit their comments. She expressed her 

              reservations about the article on mental manipulation and asked 

              that the National Consultative Commission for Human Rights view 

              this section. Article 9, Chapter V, defines mental manipulation 

              as follows: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>The act, inside a movement whose activities have for a purpose 

                or effect to create or to exploit the psychological or physical 

                dependency of those who participate in those activities; to exert 

                on an individual heavy and repeated pressure or utilise techniques 

                meant to alter his judgement thus driving him, against his will 

                or not, to an act or to an abstention of an act which is heavily 

                detrimental. </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>The resultant enquiry found no evidence that the article advocated 

              punishing an individual simply for being a member of a movement 

              that mentally manipulated people, and thus judged that the article 

              respected the fundamental freedoms of thought, belief and religion. 

              There was no mention in the report as to whether the committee examined 

              the validity of the <i>concept</i> of mental manipulation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Mental manipulation, commonly known as brainwashing, has been one 

              of the most popular explanations as to why people join NRMs. The 

              theory has been largely contested on the basis of a large amount 

              of scientific research. One problem with this theory is that it 

              absolves an individual from personal responsibility. Indeed, Hexham 

              and Poewe claim the theory opposes 'the entire Western tradition 

              of philosophical, political and social thought', which is based 

              on the assumption that 'individuals are responsible for their actions' 

              (Hexham and Poewe p. 10). Eileen Barker (of Information Network 

              Focus on Religious Movements [INFORM]) also pointed out that although 

              some groups may use deceptive means for recruiting members, this 

              cannot be equated with 'mental manipulation', which implies that 

              a person has been rendered incapable of deciding for himself or 

              herself. (Barker p. 17) </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The National Consultative Commission for Human Rights also offered 

              some recommendations to the legislators. They advised the use of 

              an existing law within the criminal code dealing with the 'abuse 

              of weakness', and that it be classified as 'attack on individuals' 

              rather than 'attack on possessions'. They also recommended an increased 

              penalty for leaders of organisations who repress people in the above-mentioned 

              ways, and advised caution in regards to the 'issue of legal responsibility 

              of a organisation'. The Commission felt these measures would negate 

              the need for a separate article on mental manipulation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>What does the French legislation entail? </b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>What does the About-Picard legislation propose at this stage? From 

              the latest report (Doc. 192) by About and the Law Commission, we 

              can understand the following: </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Chapter One, Article 1 proposes the dissolution of a corporation 

              or association whose activities 'have for a purpose or effect to 

              create or to exploit the psychological or physical subjugation of 

              those who participates in those activities'. The dissolution can 

              take place if the organisation and its leaders are convicted in 

              a court more than once for offences such as violation of an individual's 

              physical or psychological integrity; violation of a person's human 

              rights and dignity; fraud; illegal practice of medicine; forgery; 

              rape and other sexual abuses; and theft. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The second chapter proposes that any organisation, except the State, 

              be responsible for offences committed in its name by its sub-groups 

              or representatives. Chapter Two also strengthens the liability of 

              organisations as legal entities and thus reinforces their responsibility 

              for offences. This chapter proposes that an entire national organisation 

              or church be dissolved if a leader, priest, school, charity or any 

              kind of sub-organisation linked to the main body is convicted more 

              than once of the offences mentioned in the first article. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Chapter Three, Article 4, punishes anyone who maintains or re-establishes 

              an association that has been dissolved with up to three years' prison 

              and a fine of FF300,000. This increases to five years' imprisonment 

              and a fine of FF500,000 for repeat offences. There is no mention 

              of a process of rectification for a dissolved organisation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Picard had also proposed an article in Chapter Four that forbids 

              any sect activity, including advertising, within one hundred metres 

              of a hospital, retirement home, clinic, or school for children up 

              to eighteen years old. This was to be punishable by two years' imprisonment 

              and a fine of FF200,000. However, this article was subsequently 

              removed by the Senate, as was an amendment that allowed a mayor 

              to refuse building permission to organisations that had been convicted 

              of any of the above-mentioned offences. The Law Commission in the 

              Senate had approved of these two articles, but found they were too 

              difficult to implement. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Article 8 forbids any organisation, defined in the first chapter, 

              from directing its messages to minors or inviting minors to join. 

              This is punishable with a fine of FF50,000 for an individual and 

              FF250,000 for an organisation. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The article of mental manipulation was removed, allegedly because 

              of the criticism it had received, notably from the main religious 

              denominations. Instead, the article 'abuse of weakness' was inserted, 

              together with a new definition: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Fraudulent abuse of a state of ignorance or the situation of 

                weakness of a minor or a person particularly vulnerable due to 

                old age, disease, invalidity or a physiological or psychological 

                deficiency, pregnancy, or psychological or physical subjugation 

                resulting from heavy and repeated pressure or techniques meant 

                to alter the persons judgement, and when this state is known to 

                the perpetrator of the offence, to force the minor or this person 

                to an act or an abstention of an act which is heavily detrimental 

              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>One could say that the offence of mental manipulation still exists 

              within the law, but in a new context. The same words are used, although 

              the title 'mental manipulation' has been abandoned. The Committee 

              of Law also advised the senators to increase the punishment for 

              the offence of abuse of weakness 'when the offence is committed 

              by leaders or representatives of a legal entity who has for a purpose 

              or effect to create or to exploit the psychological or physical 

              subjugation of their members'. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Article 11 is designed to give the anti-cult organisations legal 

              standing to initiate criminal proceedings against NRMs, something 

              that was explicitly stated as desirable by About in his report. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>Reactions to the French approach</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>There has been some strong criticism of this proposed law. Although 

              French officials have certainly taken note of this criticism, there 

              seems to be a reluctance to change course. One deputy defended their 

              policies at a parliamentary discussion on 22 June 2000 by saying 

              that 'the attacks it [the legislation] has aroused from the sectarian 

              organisations and their friends, under the pretext of defending 

              human rights, shows very well we have pushed the right spot!' </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Not everyone involved in the legislation may embrace this view, 

              but it is not uncommon for those objecting to the law to be labelled 

              as sympathisers or members of NRMs. For example, the president of 

              MILS accused the International Helsinki Federation (IHF) of being 

              infiltrated by Scientologists.[<a href="#22f" class="maintext">22</a>]<a name="22"></a> 

              He also cancelled a meeting with a delegation from the US Department 

              of State's Office for Religious Freedom, because he (incorrectly) 

              thought one of the delegates was a Scientologist. He later relented 

              but did not speak to or answer the queries of the delegate in question.[<a href="#23f" class="maintext">23</a>]<a name="23"></a> 

              French officials in general have not appreciated the involvement 

              of US representation in this affair. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Reverend Jean-Arnold de Clermont, president of the French Protestant 

              Federation, has compared the national policies against NRMs to a 

              witch-hunt.[<a href="#24f" class="maintext">24</a>]<a name="24"></a> 

              He met with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in October 2000, accompanied 

              by Mr Bernard Lagoutte (Secretary-General of the Episcopate), Rabbi 

              Alain Goldman, and Dalil Boubakeur (Vice-chancellor of a Paris Mosque) 

              to express concern about the proposed law. They particularly opposed 

              the article on mental manipulation, believing it to be 'a vague 

              concept which can apply to anything, and why not with political 

              parties?'[<a href="#25f" class="maintext">25</a>]<a name="25"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It is also significant that Pope John Paul II, when accepting the 

              credentials of the new French ambassador to the Vatican, spoke at 

              length, publicly, on the issue of religious liberty. He stated that 

              '... religious liberty, in the full sense of the term, is the first 

              human right. This means a liberty which is not reduced to the private 

              sphere only.' He urged society - especially schools and media, who 

              have an important role in forming public opinion - to respect the 

              beliefs of others and not to discriminate on that basis. He continued 

              by saying that 'to discriminate against religious beliefs, or to 

              discredit one or another form of religious practice, is a form of 

              exclusion contrary to the respect of fundamental human values and 

              will eventually destabilise society, where a certain pluralism of 

              thought should exist, as well as a benevolent and brotherly attitude. 

              This will necessarily create a climate of tension, intolerance, 

              opposition and suspicion, not conducive to social peace.'[<a href="#26f" class="maintext">26</a>]<a name="26"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Members of the Council of Europe have made a motion that a resolution 

              be written on the situation in France. Their concern is that the 

              new law would restrict religious freedom. They write: 'creating 

              new penal offences which are not based on any accepted legal or 

              scientific evidence and which focus only on targeted minorities, 

              especially when this concerns a fundamental right, opens the door 

              to discriminatory and intolerant practice that could undermine the 

              very basics of democratic society'. They also opposed the use of 

              language when religious minorities were 'derogatively referred to 

              as "sects" ... '. </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>The word 'sect' has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. 

                In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities 

                are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, 

                this world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of larger or 

                smaller groups, with various beliefs and observances, which are 

                not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true 

                that among these groups are some which have committed criminal 

                acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements 

                is not enough to condemn all the rest. </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>It was further pointed out that laws in a democratic society cannot 

              be written against a section of society simply because it is unpopular 

              or at odds with the current political climate.[<a href="#27f" class="maintext">27</a>]<a name="27"></a>

            <p><b>On the ground: Effects on religious minorities on France</b> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The effect of this 'sect hysteria' on individuals and the organisations 

              labelled as sects should not be underestimated. The Helsinki Federation 

              has reported that 'increasing intolerance and discrimination against 

              NRMs has been observed in France' since 1996. This has 'resulted 

              in media reports libelling minority religions, the circulation of 

              rumours and false information, and incitement of religious intolerance.' 

              The report continues: 'Minority religions have been publicly marginalised 

              and stigmatised, and there have been attempts to hinder their activities 

              - for example, through denying them access to public halls for their 

              meetings or requiring them to pay higher rent. Authorities have 

              scrutinised their management, and children of minority religious 

              groups have been stigmatised as "cult members" in their schools 

              and neighbourhoods.'[<a href="#28f" class="maintext">28</a>]<a name="28"></a> 

              It has also been claimed that people have lost their jobs, businesses, 

              spouse, and custody of children in divorce cases, and that job-seekers 

              are suffering since being blacklisted as sect members. Some citizens 

              have been falsely accused of belonging to NRMs and have suffered 

              similar difficulties.[<a href="#29f" class="maintext">29</a>]<a name="29"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>One association of physicians and researchers, whose stated goal 

              is to research solutions to world pollution and hunger, reported 

              being raided by approximately two hundred heavily armed police officers. 

              Their children were taken into custody, where they were 'thoroughly 

              examined from head to foot, [and] the girls were subject to anal 

              and vaginal examinations'.[<a href="#30f" class="maintext">30</a>]<a name="30"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The government is also targeting finances of blacklisted groups. 

              For example, some Jehovah's Witness branches have not been recognised 

              as religious organisations and were therefore subjected to 60% tax 

              (amounting to FF300 million) on all donations from 1992-6.[<a href="#31f" class="maintext">31</a>]<a name="31"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It is worth remembering that this rather gloomy picture exists 

              even before the new law has been implemented. What will happen if 

              the law is passed? Will unpopular groups be banned from French society? 

              Even if the new law is interpreted in a narrow way and the French 

              Catholic Church is not dissolved because one of its bishops or priests 

              is convicted of paedophilia or fraud, the law could still be used 

              to dissolve any other group the state wants to be rid of. If this 

              does happen, French people would no longer be equal before the law, 

              but subjected to the likes and dislikes of those in power. This 

              would create a very fragile situation that is incompatible with 

              the basic foundations of a democratic society. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>INFORM and scholars' view</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Scholars of religion and sociology generally agree there are organisations 

              that are harmful and should be closely watched, but generally they 

              do not agree with the methodology and perspectives of anti-cultists. 

              It is simplistic and inaccurate to generalise too much when discussing 

              NRMs. These groups vary widely in their roles, practices and beliefs. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The Swedish report recognised the lack of objective information 

              in this field and recommended the institution of a centre where 

              dialogue and research could take place. In Britain, Professor Eileen 

              Barker started the Information Network Focus on Religious ­Movements 

              (INFORM) in 1988, with the purpose of providing objective information 

              on NRMs. INFORM is funded by London's Metropolitan Police, the main 

              Churches and the Home Office, and staff members have post-graduate 

              degrees in the Sociology of Religion. They alert people of potential 

              dangers or specific aspects of organisations, but are also careful 

              not to lump all NRMs together or neglect positive changes within 

              them. The British Home Office finds INFORM both reliable and objective. 

              There are currently no plans by French scholars to start a similar 

              project,[<a href="#32f" class="maintext">32</a>]<a name="32"></a> 

              but there are many who would like to see more unbiased information 

              circulated in France. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>France: Culture and allies</b> </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Europe's response to NRMs varies from country to country. There 

              is a general division between those who see NRMs as a danger and 

              have adopted a confrontational approach to them, and those who do 

              not perceive a problem with NRMs and are more or less neutral. There 

              are certain cultural factors that are seen as fostering adverse 

              government policies against NRMs.[<a href="#33f" class="maintext">33</a>]<a name="33"></a> 

              In the case of France, there are two aspects that I find particularly 

              important. One is France's general attitude towards ethnic minorities; 

              the second is the French government's alliance with anti-cult organisations 

              and the adoption of their perspectives. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>French culture has strong historical roots in secular humanism.[<a href="#34f" class="maintext">34</a>]<a name="34"></a> 

              French law protects the individual, but not ethnic or religious 

              minorities. France has adopted a policy of assimilation of citizens 

              from former colonies. They are welcome as long as they 'submerge 

              their cultural identities within the dominant French secular culture 

              and ideology', while the opposite would result in 'ghettoisation'. 

              (Boyle p. 296) In order to ensure the individual's right to opinions 

              free from cultural or religious boundaries, integration is given 

              more importance than preservation of cultural differences, especially 

              where these are linked to religion. For example, there has been 

              an ongoing debate about the right of Muslim girls to wear headscarves 

              (<i>hijab</i>) in schools. The perspective of the majority of the 

              French intellectual elite is that schools should be an 'emancipatory 

              space' where 'ethnic, religious or political allegiance should be 

              left at the door' and where children from different origins become 

              French. (Boyle p. 299) It is felt that wearing religious symbols 

              would impede this process and encourage discrimination. Minorities 

              indigenous to France (Alsatians, Basques, Bretons and Catalans) 

              and the growing Muslim community are calling for a more pluralistic 

              definition of French nationhood. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Another important factor is the adoption by the French government 

              of perspectives favoured by its anti-cult movement. The controversial 

              nature of the anti-cult movement is highlighted by China's recent 

              measures against Falun Gong, a health and meditation movement that 

              claims to have no political agenda. The Chinese authorities banned 

              Falun Gong in 1999 and have since issued repressive measures and 

              jailed many members of the group. China's crackdown on Falun Gong 

              has led to strong reactions from world leaders - the administration 

              of US President George W. Bush has publicly condemned it; the European 

              Union has called it an 'unacceptable' violation of human rights; 

              the European parliament has issued a resolution that calls for China 

              to respect religious freedom and the Dutch Foreign Minister cancelled 

              his trip to China when the Chinese government publicly opposed a 

              meeting between Falun Gong members and Dutch officials in Hong Kong. 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The French anti-cult group CCMM found the Chinese measures laudable, 

              and commented that 'the fact that a country as vast and as populated 

              as China is preoccupied with this movement [Falun Gong] should have 

              evoked some attention.'[<a href="#35f" class="maintext">35</a>]<a name="35"></a> 

              This statement leads one to wonder whether the CCMM is unaware of 

              China's precarious position in the world with regard to human rights. 

              The Chinese government invited representatives from CCMM and FECRIS[<a href="#36f" class="maintext">36</a>]<a name="36"></a> 

              to an international symposium on 'destructive sects' in November 

              2000 to learn how to deal with groups like Falun Gong. The president 

              of MILS attended the conference as an observer. The CCMM reported 

              that they were warmly received and that France is cited as an example 

              in these issues because of 'the degree and coherence of the measures 

              taken to respond to the sectarian threat'. The French government 

              has been closely cooperating with CCMM, together with UNADFI, in 

              developing their strategy against NRMs, both having received substantial 

              funding from the government for their activities. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>China, which does not have a good international record in religious 

              freedom, is finding an ally in France, a well-established democratic 

              country. One might ask whether France might similarly become a model 

              for the new and fragile democracies in Eastern Europe. Many of these 

              countries, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and different 

              regions within the CIS, are in the process of changing their religious 

              laws and policies, and they are looking for models in recognised 

              democratic countries. European anti-cult groups have also found 

              an arena in these countries and have succeeded in influencing governments 

              in adopting policies against 'new' religions.[<a href="#37f" class="maintext">37</a>]<a name="37"></a> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><b>The role of governments in protecting religious freedoms</b> 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>In regard to religious freedom there are two areas that need to 

              be looked at by Western democracies: The bias of some governments 

              towards anti-cult groups and the position of these governments in 

              the context of the international community's stance on religious 

              freedom. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Religious intolerance is no longer just part of an individual country's 

              internal affairs, especially not in an increasingly integrated Western 

              Europe. No country's approach should be seen in isolation. As some 

              Western European countries continue to create policies against NRMs, 

              others will follow suit, perhaps spawning measures that we may not 

              foresee. One consequence of globalisation, whether we like it or 

              not, is a pluralistic society where many different beliefs co-exist. 

              How should society respond to this challenge? Should it ban beliefs 

              that are not considered acceptable by some? If so, who will define 

              what is an acceptable belief and what is not? Should the issue be 

              looked at from a global or a national perspective? What is the role 

              of dialogue between different cultures, minorities and belief systems? 

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The United Nations has expressed a global vision to diminish, end 

              and prevent conflicts by declaring 2001 as the Year of Dialogue 

              among Civilisations. In the preface to <i>Freedom of Religion and 

              Belief - A World Report </i>Abdelfattah Amor writes: </p>

            <p></p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Any examination of freedom of religion or belief today needs 

                to address the massive religious revival which is characterising 

                the end of the century. Should we anticipate in the wake of this 

                revival an increase in tolerance, enlightenment and freedom, or 

                are we to be faced with greater intolerance and discrimination, 

                condemned to a further period of extremism, darkness and inquisition? 

              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p></p>

            <p>Western Europe could go either way. A sensible approach might be 

              for governments to set up a system of dialogue with all religious 

              groups, both minority and majority religions. That could assist 

              in diminishing prejudice and set an example for the newer democracies 

              in Eastern Europe. The French government has so far refused to engage 

              in dialogue with most NRMs. This may be a factor in the French Parliament's 

              perceived need to legislate against them. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It will be interesting to see how other European countries respond 

              to France's policies against NRMs and how they interpret human rights 

              in this context. Will other countries follow the same path or will 

              France find itself isolated? If France's present measures against 

              religious movements are based on a cultural philosophy - that to 

              be French means to be a secular humanist - the question arises as 

              to how France views the future of the ­European Union, where it 

              is promoting the idea of a federation of states. On one hand France 

              is trying to protect French culture and its identity, but on the 

              other hand, France wants a unified Europe. If France does not accept 

              diversity in its own country, will it be able to accept diversity 

              within the European Union? This is an important question. It will 

              therefore be interesting to follow the development of France's present 

              policies against NRMs, the international reaction, and how France 

              in turn will respond. Perhaps the real question is: 'Is France capable 

              of dialogue?' </p>

              According to police reports, there seems a strong likelihood that 

              most who died were murdered (Alberta report, 24 October 1994). The 

              police have also found links to money laundering and drug trade, 

              a possible motive for murder (Stern, 13 October 1994). </p>
