            <p><i>In this article Prof. Thomas J. Hopkins presents a broad historical 

              view of issues of scriptural and institutional authority. He compares 

              these issues as they appear in the main Abrahamic religions with 

              their counterparts in Hinduism, and specifically how they affect 

              ISKCON. We are taken on a tour of the development of Christianity, 

              Islam and Judaism and shown how these developments are informed 

              and moulded by debate over where authority lies. These developments 

              are then compared to developments in Hinduism. These are issues 

              that will confront ISKCON, and history may contain some useful lessons 

              for our own development.</i> </p>

            <p></p>

            The issue of authority is as old as human culture. Every human institution 

            poses the question of how order will be maintained, and no institution 

            or social group - including ISKCON - can survive over time without 

            resolving this question in some way. Who should be in charge? What 

            directions or standards should be followed? How are these issues to 

            be decided? To what extent should the present community and its institutions 

            be influenced by people, ideas, or arrangements from the past? How 

            can the community decide when change is needed and when it should 

            be resisted? How can the transition from past to future be negotiated 

            in the constantly moving present, and what should guide this process? 

            How can order and freedom be balanced within the chosen system of 

            authority, and what values influence this balance? 

            <p></p>

            <b>Origins </b> 

            <p></p>

            The need for authority can be traced back to the central reality of 

            human life, the relationship of parents and children. We all enter 

            the world as helpless infants, dependent on our parents for life itself. 

            Our first experience of authority is thus very personal and largely 

            informal; authority is implicit in family relationships and defined 

            by habit, tradition, and the dynamics of daily interactions. This 

            pattern continues through years of childcare, during which we are 

            socialised and acculturated first to the family unit and then to the 

            surrounding society. In the course of this process, however, the innate 

            authority of the family is gradually superseded by that of larger 

            social units with more formal and explicit claims to authority. Authority 

            then becomes an issue, because the new forms of authority are no longer 

            based on the natural relationships within a family but on a variety 

            of external social conditions. Biology, we might say, gives way at 

            this point to cultural history. 

            <p></p>

            In the early stages of human culture the largest social units were 

            usually clans or tribes, which still preserved a 'family' sense of 

            biological connection. As societies became more complex, more diverse, 

            and more stratified, however, social order and cohesion required new 

            forms of authority that transcended biological ties. Whatever form 

            such 'higher' authority took, it was necessarily less innate than 

            family structures of authority and had to depend on different criteria 

            to legitimise it. This stage of development was reached at different 

            times in different places; both the forms of authority and the asserted 

            grounds for their ­legitimisation therefore became as diverse as the 

            purposes they served and the cultures in which they appeared. Political, 

            social, economic, and religious authority took different forms to 

            suit these various spheres of activity, and the legitimisation for 

            each was suitably different. Thus, over time, we see the emergence 

            of culturally different political systems, laws, social and economic 

            rules, and religious teachings that define authority within each sphere. 

            <p></p>

            This stage of development has typically been reached at different 

            times for different spheres of activity even within the same cultural 

            tradition, and different cultural traditions differ even more from 

            each other in how and when they define the various forms of authority. 

            Moreover, even when authority has been defined within each sphere, 

            this is not the end of the process. Political authority even within 

            a well-defined system is always subject to competing forces; laws 

            must be constantly changed or supplemented; social and economic rules 

            must be revised to fit new circumstances; and religious teachings 

            must always be interpreted anew to meet the needs of each new time 

            and place. Having clearly defined sources and statements of authority 

            helps in each of these spheres, but does not guarantee finality. However 

            legitimate authority may be, each new community and each new generation 

            must re-examine its claims and accept its terms in its own unique 

            way. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Conflicts of authority within religious traditions </b> 

            <p></p>

            The need for communities and new generations to re-examine their claims 

            of authority is certainly no less true of religious authority than 

            of any other, despite the typical claims of legitimisation at the 

            highest level. Even setting aside the conflicting claims between religious 

            traditions, no historical tradition has lasted for long without internal 

            conflicts over its own sources of authority. What are the legitimate 

            sources of authority, and what legitimises them? What priority should 

            each have? How - and by whom - should disputes over priority be resolved? 

            How should the sources of authority be understood, and who has the 

            right to interpret them? How should the accepted authority be applied 

            within the religious community, on what grounds, and by whom? Can 

            earlier decisions on these issues be changed, and if so, how and by 

            whom? 

            <p></p>

            ISKCON has had to face many of these issues in the years since Prabhupada's 

            passing away in 1977. Prabhupada may have had to deal with similar 

            questions when he was starting ISKCON, but during his lifetime he 

            himself was seen as the source of authority for his followers. Very 

            few of the movement's early members knew about the tradition of Bengal 

            Vaisnavism that formed the background for Prabhupada's devotional 

            life and teachings, and even fewer knew about the work of Bhaktivinoda 

            Thakura and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati that led Prabhupada's mission 

            to the West. All of this background was channelled into ISKCON through 

            Prabhupada, and he was the one who had to select and present the received 

            authorities to Westerners through English translations of Bengali 

            and Sanskrit sources and through commentaries and teachings that made 

            these sources meaningful to those who had no prior knowledge of their 

            origins or contents. It was thus only after Prabhupada passed away 

            that his disciples had to face the problems of authority directly 

            for themselves and sort out the tangled web of texts, organisations, 

            and teachers on which Prabhupada had drawn for his own authoritative 

            leadership. 

            <p></p>

            These questions about authority are familiar not just because they 

            are relevant to ISKCON but because they are almost universal in the 

            major world religions and are central in religions, such as Judaism, 

            Christianity, and Islam, that claim divine revelation as their foundation. 

            Judaism, for example, considers the Hebrew Scriptures to have been 

            revealed by God, but these scriptures also reflect the historic tension 

            within the Jewish community between the authoritative roles of priests, 

            prophets, and rabbis. Priests emphasised the ritual texts that governed 

            their sphere of activity, while the texts produced by prophets often 

            criticised priests for putting ritual ahead of morality and justice. 

            This tension was only resolved after the Roman destruction of the 

            Temple in 70 CE (which made the temple priests irrelevant) and the 

            rise of the Christian Roman Empire (which made the role of prophets 

            irrelevant among a largely Diaspora Jewish community). By that time, 

            however, religious authority had shifted to the rabbis who interpreted 

            Jewish Law on a local basis. 

            <p></p>

            The ultimate authority for the rabbis remained the Hebrew Scriptures 

            - especially the first five books known as <i>Torah</i> - but application 

            of their laws to changing social conditions required new interpretations 

            of Scripture. Eventually, these interpretations were brought together 

            in what became known as the Talmud, a massive collection of rabbinic 

            commentaries and discussions of religious law that define what we 

            know as Rabbinic Judaism (or simply 'Judaism,' since no other form 

            now exists). The Hebrew Scriptures formed the core of the Talmudic 

            texts, but over time the scriptures themselves became less influential 

            than the Talmudic texts on which later rabbinic authority is largely 

            based. In more recent centuries, rabbinic authority itself has been 

            differently understood in the Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformed 

            versions of Rabbinic Judaism, especially with regard to how traditional 

            Jewish laws apply to modern culture. The result is conflict not only 

            over which texts have authority but whose interpretations should be 

            followed in applying them. 

            <p></p>

            Islam has gone through a similar struggle with problems of authority. 

            All Muslims believe that Allah conveyed the <i>Koran</i> to Muhammad 

            in a series of revelations, that ­Muhammad transmitted them to his 

            followers in Arabic, and that the <i>Koran</i> is the verbatim record 

            of these revelations. Some or all of the revelations may have been 

            written down at the time (though not by Muhammad), but they were also 

            memorised and organised in their present form during or soon after 

            Muhammad's lifetime. The resulting text consists of individual revelations 

            in Arabic arranged in order of decreasing length to aid memorisation, 

            and it is this Arabic text alone that has final authority as the Word 

            of Allah. 

            <p></p>

            Muhammad, however, was not just the one to whom Allah's words were 

            revealed; he was also the political and legal authority for the new 

            Muslim community. He directed the campaigns by which his followers 

            gained control of Arabia and the surrounding areas, and he adjudicated 

            disputes within the Islamic community at every level from personal 

            and family concerns to affairs of state. It was thus not only the 

            revealed words of Allah that had authority for his followers but also 

            the example of Muhammad's own actions and judgements during the years 

            of his leadership. Like the revelations he received, what he did and 

            said on specific occasions was remembered by those directly involved 

            and became part of his permanent legacy. 

            <p></p>

            When Muhammad died, the immediate problem for his successors was to 

            collect both his revelations and the reports of his deeds and sayings 

            in the most accurate form possible. The latter had seldom been written 

            down, so a system had to be set up to assess the circumstances under 

            which they occurred and the reliability of those who claimed to have 

            received and remembered them. These remembered examples were in time 

            codified as what was called <i>Hadith</i>, reports of Muhammad's teaching 

            and conduct as certified by the authority of their transmitters. Within 

            a few centuries of Muhammad's death, there were six authoritative 

            collections of <i>Hadith</i> recognised by the Sunni ('mainstream') 

            Muslim community and another adopted by the rival Shiite community 

            that gave special authority to the Shiite imams, their distinctive 

            spiritual leaders. Different schools of law developed around these 

            collections, each attempting in its own way to determine the relevant 

            authority of the <i>Koran</i>, the <i>Hadith</i> collections, and 

            local practices to create normative community standards. 

            <p></p>

            It was not only Muhammad's moral and legal guidance that had to be 

            maintained when he died, however, but also his political leadership. 

            From the moment of his death onward, there were questions about who 

            should be his Caliph or 'Successor' and what standards should be used 

            to select him. Should he be chosen on the basis of his relationship 

            to ­Muhammad, his spiritual character, his political/military skills, 

            or his membership in a particular family or community? Should there 

            be one Caliph to rule over all Muslims, or should leadership be more 

            decentralised and based on more regional or cultural factors? These 

            issues surfaced in various forms in almost every generation, and a 

            major conflict over succession eventually split the Muslim community 

            into the rival Sunni and Shiite branches. This split did not resolve 

            other problems, however, and disputes about the authority of different 

            <i>Hadith</i> collections, legal schools, and leadership principles 

            continue to generate factional conflicts within each branch. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Authority in Christianity </b> 

            <p></p>

            It is fair to say from this brief overview that issues of authority 

            have had significant influences on both Judaism and Islam from their 

            origins to the present. By contrast, however, the problems of authority 

            in these two traditions are minimal compared to the struggles over 

            authority within Christianity. Both the letters of Paul the Apostle 

            (the earliest Christian writings) and the four Gospels (the next oldest) 

            indicate that issues of authority began during the ministry of Jesus 

            and became critical during the first few generations after his death. 

            The first and most basic question was whether Jesus was the predicted 

            Messiah (in Greek, the Christ or 'Anointed One'). If he was the Messiah/Christ, 

            he had great authority; if he was not, then it was not clear what 

            authority he might have as a simple itinerant teacher. This question 

            was not resolved for his followers until after his death, when his 

            resurrection and appearance to his disciples proved to them that he 

            was in fact the one anointed by God to bring a new message of salvation. 

            <p></p>

            But what was this message, this 'Good News' (Gospel) of salvation 

            brought by Jesus? Jesus' teachings over a period of several years 

            were remembered by his disciples, but the authority of the teachings 

            depended on the authority of Jesus as the Risen Christ. How was this 

            authority to be understood, and how did the message of this Jewish 

            teacher relate to earlier Jewish scriptures whose authority he accepted? 

            Even more critically, to whom did the Gospel apply? Was it intended 

            only for Jews, who made up his initial following, or did it apply 

            also to Gentiles, non-Jews, who were the main population of the Roman 

            Empire and whose political rule covered even the Jewish homeland in 

            Judea and its capital Jerusalem? 

            <p></p>

            From the beginning, there was tension within the new Christian community 

            between those who wanted to maintain Jewish identity and practices 

            (the so-called 'Judaisers') and those, like Paul, who wanted to include 

            Gentiles within the Christian community and make Jewish practices 

            optional. This issue was effectively resolved in 70 CE, a few years 

            after Paul's death, when the Romans destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem 

            - an event that ended the authoritative role of temple priests in 

            Jewish life and greatly diminished the importance of Jerusalem for 

            both Jews and Christians. Rabbinic Judaism and its synagogues remained 

            alive and well in other parts of the Roman Empire, but the appeal 

            of the early 'Judaisers' rapidly declined, and Christianity soon became 

            a predominantly Gentile religion co-existing with Diaspora Judaism 

            and Roman paganism. Christians still relied on the Hebrew Scriptures 

            as their only authoritative scriptures, however, and did not agree 

            on the contents of their own distinctive scriptural authority (the 

            New Testament) until after Constantine had adopted Christianity as 

            the official religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century CE. 

            <p></p>

            Struggles over several different kinds of authority characterised 

            these early Christian centuries. How authoritative should Jewish practices 

            be for Christians? What was the authority of the Hebrew Scriptures, 

            and how did their authority relate to that of the new specifically 

            Christian scriptures? How should Christians relate to the classical 

            Greek culture that characterised the eastern regions of the Roman 

            Empire? Which of the existing Christian writings (all in Greek) should 

            be given canonical authority, and whose authority should decide this? 

            What authority should Christians grant to the Roman Empire, and what 

            authority must they reserve for themselves in order to be true to 

            their faith? What essential beliefs and practices defined who was 

            a Christian, and on whose authority was this to be decided? 

            <p></p>

            Debates over these issues turned into power struggles between Christian 

            churches and communities in different parts of the Mediterranean world. 

            Official recognition of the Church in the fourth century CE led imperial 

            authorities to intervene in these disputes with a series of Church 

            councils that brought charges of heresy against several Christian 

            communities and their churches, blurring the lines between political 

            and religious authority and creating tensions between the Western 

            (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) churches. These tensions were further 

            increased by a series of conflicts over a period of several centuries 

            between the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) and the patriarchs of the Greek-language 

            churches in the eastern ­Mediterranean - conflicts which came to a 

            head in 1054 CE when the Patriarch of Constantinople was commanded 

            to acknowledge the papacy in Rome as the supreme church authority. 

            When the patriarch refused and negotiations failed, the eastern churches 

            were excommunicated by Rome and in turn declared themselves and their 

            Eastern Orthodox tradition independent of the Roman papacy. 

            <p></p>

            By this point in Christian history, at the start of the second millennium 

            CE, many different forms of Christianity had evolved from the early 

            community of Jewish disciples who followed Jesus. An originally Jewish 

            movement had moved outward into the Gentile world of the Roman Empire, 

            created its own scriptural canon in Greek, and spread from the eastern 

            Mediterranean region westward into Latin Europe, southward into Egypt 

            and North Africa, eastward into Asia as far as India and China, and 

            northward into Eastern Europe. Each development had brought changes, 

            some creating conflicts with other branches, and each set of new conditions 

            created a need for new policies, theologies, and institutions. Issues 

            of authority figured in every stage of this process: the authority 

            of Jesus as a teacher, the continuing authority of the Hebrew Scriptures 

            and Jewish law, the authority of the Risen Christ as a Saviour, the 

            authority of Apostles such as Peter and Paul, the individual and collective 

            authority of the New Testament scriptures, the authority of the early 

            Greek and Latin Church Fathers, the authority of church leaders such 

            as the patriarchs and the Pope, the relative authority of Church and 

            Empire, etc. 

            <p></p>

            What Christianity meant to any given individual at this point thus 

            depended on how all of these authorities were understood and accepted 

            or rejected by his or her branch of the Christian tradition, by the 

            relevant local church leaders, and by himself or herself. Some of 

            the possible meanings were unacceptable to those who relied on different 

            authorities, so Christianity as a whole contained mutually incompatible 

            parts. The Nestorian, Coptic, and Syrian Orthodox churches were declared 

            heretical by fifth century imperial church councils and remained as 

            'Separated' churches outside the authority of both Eastern Orthodox 

            patriarchs and the Roman Pope. The latter two authorities were then 

            themselves made mutually exclusive by the events of 1054 and remained 

            separate from that point on. A thousand years from its origins, Christianity 

            clearly was a different thing for members of each of these churches 

            even though they accepted many of the same authorities. As in many 

            basic conflicts, it was the relatively few things that they did not 

            agree on that split them apart and led them to argue over the meaning 

            of even those authorities they held in common, most notably Jesus 

            Christ and the New Testament scriptures. 

            <p></p>

            <b>The Protestant Reformation</b> 

            <p></p>

            Christianity was not yet finished with its splits by the early second 

            millennium, however. Most of the divisions so far had taken place 

            within the eastern regions of the Church, culminating in the split 

            between the papal authority in Rome and the Eastern Orthodox churches. 

            Papal authority and Roman Christianity were at that point still supreme 

            in the western ­Mediterranean regions and had expanded to include 

            all of Western Europe, inspiring and in turn benefiting from the great 

            European intellectual and cultural Renaissance in the fourteenth and 

            fifteenth centuries. By the sixteenth century, however, large-scale 

            political and economic changes and new religious ideas were sparking 

            challenges to papal authority and prompting calls for church reform. 

            These trends finally reached fruition during the first half of the 

            century in what is called the Protestant Reformation, a series of 

            regional religious movements in Western Europe that had in common 

            mainly their concern to free Christian faith and practice from the 

            control of papal and priestly authority. 

            <p></p>

            Like the earlier conflicts and splits within Christianity, the Protestant 

            Reformation had deep-seated roots and far-reaching consequences that 

            cannot be explored here in any detail. All of the numerous protest 

            and reform movements that made up the Reformation, however, had grievances 

            against both papal authority and many of the institutions and practices 

            of the Church that rested on that authority. Luther and Calvin, the 

            most influential Reformers, challenged papal authority with the authority 

            of the Scriptures, the 'word of God,' and argued that a faithful Church 

            should not teach, legislate, or institutionalise anything not contained 

            in the Scriptures and thereby sanctioned as God's will. Salvation 

            in their view could never be conveyed by human institutions or rituals 

            but only by God's grace administered by the Holy Spirit, and it is 

            granted not on the basis of human works but to those who have faith. 

            Neither the Pope nor priests therefore have the power either to grant 

            salvation or to withhold it, because salvation is a gift of God given 

            directly to all who have faith in Him. 

            <p></p>

            Luther, Calvin, and other Reformation leaders did not initially seek 

            separation from the Roman (or, as it came to call itself, the Roman 

            Catholic) Church. Their challenges and protests, however, involved 

            issues that could not be resolved without an agreement on papal authority 

            - and this in the long run proved impossible. The result was the gradual 

            emergence of a variety of so-called Protestant churches out from under 

            the jurisdiction of the Pope and the Church of Rome - churches that 

            often did not agree among themselves on many matters beyond their 

            rejection of papal authority. The Reformation thus gave rise not to 

            a unified Protestant Church but to many separate forms of Protestant 

            Christianity that were often in conflict with each other as well as 

            with Roman Catholicism and that have, over the past few centuries, 

            continued both to divide into new denominations and recombine into 

            new Protestant churches. 

            <p></p>

            One need not follow the tangled web of Protestant history in detail 

            to recognise the effects of rejecting papal authority in favour of 

            Scripture and personal faith. The Roman Catholic Church by the sixteenth 

            century was a highly centralised religious institution in which authority 

            radiated outward from the Pope through the ordained celibate priesthood 

            and monastic orders (collectively called 'the religious') to ordinary 

            laypersons by means of rituals, preaching, and the teachings of the 

            Church. The version of the Bible used in the Roman Church was the 

            Latin Vulgate, a fourth-century translation of the Hebrew Old Testament 

            and the Greek New ­Testament that was inaccessible to most laypersons 

            both because of its language and because it existed only in the form 

            of hand-copied manuscripts in Church libraries. What laypersons knew 

            of the Scriptures was thus necessarily second-hand, mediated to them 

            by the priests in rituals and sermons or interpreted for them by Church 

            teachings. 

            <p></p>

            All of this was turned on its head by the Protestant Reformation, 

            beginning with the work of Martin Luther in Germany. For Luther, Scripture 

            as the revelation of God's Word was the sole authority for the Church 

            and for the individual Christian. There was no exclusive papal right 

            to interpret the Scriptures as claimed by the Roman Church, and no 

            need for priests to mediate Scripture to laypersons. Every Christian 

            believer was in fact a priest by virtue of baptism, and this 'priesthood 

            of all believers' made it possible for each believer to appropriate 

            the Scriptures directly without the intervention of papal authority 

            - a task that Luther made simpler by translating the New Testament 

            from Greek into idiomatic German and publishing it for a mass readership 

            by means of the recently invented printing press. Furthermore, if 

            laypersons were priests, then there was no reason for a celibate clergy 

            (an argument that Luther manifested in his own life by marrying a 

            former nun) and the life and work of laypersons should be given the 

            same respect as that of clergy, monks, and nuns whom the Church had 

            formerly labelled 'the religious' in contrast to laypersons. Since 

            salv­ation is by faith, and faith is an individual matter, there is 

            no privileged class with special authority to mediate God's grace 

            and grant salvation to others. 

            <p></p>

            While various Reformers disagreed with some of Luther's positions 

            on other matters, all of them basically accepted these fundamental 

            principles. All gave primary authority to the Scriptures, all rejected 

            required celibacy for the clergy, all insisted on the importance of 

            marriage and the dignity of lay life and lay occupations, and all 

            believed in salvation of the individual believer by faith. Access 

            to the Scriptures and study of the Scriptures thus became essential 

            concerns of the Protestant churches, married clergy became the norm, 

            and there was substantial lay involvement in activities such as preaching, 

            teaching, and church management that the Roman Church reserved for 

            the celibate clergy. Protestant churches continued to ordain clergy, 

            but ordination was seen not as entry into a priestly role dependent 

            on papal authority but as a commission to perform special duties prescribed 

            by Scripture on behalf of the ordaining church. Across the many differences 

            that separated Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists - to name only 

            the three largest early Protestant divisions - these features as well 

            as the common rejection of papal authority came to define ­Protestantism 

            as a distinctive branch of the Christian tradition alongside the older 

            Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. 

            <p></p>

            How could such a variety of churches come forth from the simple early 

            Christian community in Judea? Or, to put it another way, how could 

            accepting Jesus as the Messiah/Christ and Saviour have so many different 

            results? If we look only at the beginning and the end points, it is 

            hard to see how all of the latter can connect to the single starting 

            point. If we start at the beginning and go forward step by step, however, 

            we can see that the gradual branching out into different churches 

            was the product of a series of decisions made at critical junctures, 

            most of them involving conflicts over authority. In most cases, moreover, 

            those who made these decisions - on both sides of the conflict - believed 

            that they were preserving the original or true tradition against threats 

            to important Christian principles. 

            <p></p>

            This was certainly the case in the early Church Councils, where the 

            churches that were soon to be 'Separated' defended the authority of 

            their patriarchs and their theological principles against the victorious 

            parties and continued to defend them even after being excluded from 

            the mainstream Church - a Church that was 'mainstream' because it 

            was victorious in the councils and received both imperial and papal 

            backing. The same was also true when the Eastern Orthodox churches 

            rejected what they considered an illegitimate claim to supreme authority 

            by the Pope and the Roman Church and were excommunicated because the 

            Pope believed that they were refusing an authority sanctioned by Christ 

            through the Apostle Peter. Finally, some four and a half centuries 

            later, that same papal authority was challenged by the Protestant 

            reformers in a conflict that led to the last major split in the Christian 

            Church, leaving in place a series of conflicts over authority within 

            the Church as a whole that have still not been resolved even today. 

            <p></p>

            It should be noted that not all of these conflicts and splits have 

            been of the same kind. Before the Reformation, the major conflicts 

            were between established churches whose patriarchs or bishops claimed 

            authority for their current institutional doctrines and practices. 

            The Protestant churches, however, introduced a new element - appeal 

            to the authority of ­Scripture alone - that gave the scriptural canon 

            of the early Church greater authority than the institutions and leadership 

            of the later Church. This authority, moreover, was not reserved for 

            the hierarchy of the church or even for the clergy at large; it was 

            in principle in the hands of all of the members, clergy and lay alike, 

            through their direct access to the Scriptures. Unlike the earlier 

            Orthodox and Roman churches, the Protestant churches were therefore 

            inherently decentralised in terms of institutional authority. They 

            were also inherently unstable, because every church's authority at 

            any time could be challenged by appeals to Scripture and the standards 

            of the early Church. Later Protestant history shows this in the numerous 

            divisions and transformations of the original Reformation churches, 

            a process that might be considered - and by Protestants, with pride 

            - as a continual Reformation that remains true to the authority of 

            Scripture over against that of institutions. 

            <p></p>

            It is clear that the Protestant type of authority does not give precedence 

            to institutional order or church hierarchies, but tries to return 

            to the authority of revelation as mediated through Scripture and embodied 

            in the diverse forms of the early Church. Diversity is the key factor 

            here, because the Scriptures and the forms and institutions of the 

            early Church are quite diverse and allow for multiple interpretations. 

            Order and hierarchy depend on reducing diversity and ambiguity in 

            favour of narrower 'official' interpretations and clear priorities. 

            The Protestant churches' strategy, if we may call it that, is to seek 

            authority in a time before the Church developed its centralised order 

            and locate that authority in texts and churches diverse enough to 

            allow for new interpretations and new priorities. Later institutions 

            filtered out much of the rich content of these sources when they tried 

            to systematise them, but removing the filters - so Protestants believe 

            - will help recover the full meaning of the divine revelation and 

            the initial human responses to it. Given these assumptions, it is 

            not surprising that Protestants have led the way in historical studies 

            of the early Church and in Biblical criticism - i.e., in careful evaluations 

            of the earliest sources of authority to give their faith the most 

            accurate foundation possible.

            Authority, as we can see from these examples, has many forms and has 

            played many different roles in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. It 

            is evident, moreover, that authority does not appear in the abstract; 

            it always appears in a particular context with a specific identity 

            and form. Jews find it in <i>Torah</i> and rabbinic teachings, and 

            at times grant it to specific individuals, but what is authority for 

            some Jews may not be authority for others. Muslims in general locate 

            authority in the <i>Koran</i> and in the teachings and sayings of 

            Muhammad, but only some Muslims grant authority to specific schools 

            of law and only specific branches of Shiite Islam acknowledge the 

            authority of certain imams such as the Iranian ayatollahs or the Agha 

            Khan. There is even more variation within Christianity, because the 

            process of division began earlier and the many branches have remained 

            parts of the larger tradition - still separated, for the most part, 

            by the same conflicts over authority that gave rise to the initial 

            divisions. 

            <p></p>

            All of these religions, we must note, worship a single God who is 

            in principle the same God for Jews, Muslims, and Christians; they 

            all trace their origins back to the patriarch ­Abraham; they acknowledge 

            many of the same prophets; and there is much similarity or overlap 

            in their scriptures. If there is so much variation in the forms and 

            sources of authority within these closely related monotheistic religions 

            of Middle Eastern and Semitic origin, then how much similarity can 

            there be between them and a religious tradition such as ­Hinduism 

            in terms of what authority means and how it functions? Surprisingly, 

            quite a lot, with some very important implications for ISKCON. 

            <p></p>

            There is no denying the great differences between Hinduism and the 

            Middle Eastern or Abrahamic religions, beginning with their concepts 

            of divinity. Judaism, Islam, and ­Christianity all believe that there 

            is only one God who has created the world and all its beings, and 

            they believe that this God alone should be worshiped. They thus reject 

            any form of polytheism, and deny that any deity other than the one 

            God exists. The one true God, moreover, in their common view, cannot 

            be represented by any material form, and thus the worship of any image 

            of a divine being (a practice which all three call 'idolatry') is 

            necessarily worship of a false god. All of these positions were first 

            stated in the Hebrew Scriptures, were adopted from there by Christianity, 

            and were restated even more forcibly in the <i>Koran</i>, making them 

            among the most basic beliefs of the three monotheistic Abrahamic religions 

            and among the most deeply rooted in their respective authoritative 

            scriptures. They also, of course, represent basic conflicts between 

            these religions and the polytheism and image worship that characterise 

            much of Hinduism, making any commonality seem unlikely. 

            <p></p>

            Similar contrasts emerge if we compare religious institutions, although 

            here there are also major differences between the three Abrahamic 

            religions. Christianity was organised into centralised regional churches 

            ruled by patriarchs or bishops from early in its history, and this 

            pattern continued in most branches of the Church even after the Reformation 

            churches introduced new institutional patterns in the sixteenth century. 

            Judaism and Islam, however, never had centralised institutions or 

            hierarchical authorities with the same kind of formalised power. Neither 

            temple priests nor rabbis had more than local authority in early Judaism, 

            and both were subject to the authority of <i>Torah</i>. Islam recognised 

            no religious organisation other than the community of the faithful, 

            and authority for the community was vested in the <i>Koran</i> and 

            <i>Hadith</i>. The Ulema, the Muslim scholars of scripture and the 

            law, played a role similar to that of Jewish rabbis as non-priestly 

            teachers of the scriptures and tradition whose authority depended 

            on personal knowledge rather than hierarchical status. Neither rabbis 

            nor Ulema have close equivalents in Christianity, and the role of 

            both is quite different from the ritual role of Christian priests 

            and ministers. 

            <p></p>

            Hinduism, from these comparisons, stands in a rather odd relationship 

            to the monotheistic religions of Abraham. Its tolerance of polytheism 

            and image worship - or, more aptly, its celebration of them - is in 

            sharp contrast to the absolute prohibition of both in Judaism and 

            Islam and the strong antipathies to both seen in much of Christianity 

            - although some see the veneration of Mary and the images and icons 

            of Jesus in certain churches as exceptions to the general Christian 

            rule. At the level of religious institutions, however, the non-centralised 

            Muslim and Jewish traditions have more in common with Hinduism than 

            they do with Christianity - even with most of the denominations of 

            Protestant Christianity. Jewish rabbis and Muslim Koranic scholars 

            in the Ulema share many characteristics and roles with Hindu Brahmins 

            in their scholarly and teaching roles, although they differ from them 

            in their priestly roles, and all three differ from mainstream Christianity 

            in the absence of anything like a Church to ordain them to the ministry 

            or priesthood. The essential religious institutions for all three 

            non-Christian traditions are decentralised in local communities, and 

            there is no reliance on a centralised institutional authority to maintain 

            the religious life of these communities. Perhaps most strikingly, 

            Islam and Hinduism - which are in the sharpest conflict over polytheism 

            and images - are the closest in agreement on this latter point. 

            <p></p>

            As these examples indicate, it is hard to compare these traditions 

            meaningfully in terms of either their beliefs or their institutional 

            forms. They agree on certain specifics and disagree on others, and 

            it is difficult to see which of these instances is most important. 

            The only useful way to compare different traditions such as these 

            is to ask what is at stake for each tradition on any given issue: 

            i.e., how essential is this particular belief or practice or institution 

            to each tradition, and why? The real issue in any comparison is not 

            so much the specifics as the authority on which they are based. If 

            certain features rest on weak or uncertain authority, they are clearly 

            less essential to that tradition than other features - and less essential 

            than the same features may be to another tradition that gives them 

            greater authority. But who in a given tradition decides whether certain 

            features have strong authoritative backing or whether they are less 

            authoritative - i.e., whether or not they can be minimised or dispensed 

            with without losing something essential? 

            <p></p>

            In Christianity, this last question could be answered by reference 

            to the central authority: the patriarch or Pope, for example, or a 

            hierarchical ruling body designated to decide such issues. In Judaism 

            or Islam, which have no centralised authority, decisions about beliefs 

            and practices would typically be answered by rabbis or the Ulema with 

            reference to the defining scriptures of the tradition and to past 

            decisions by scholars on relevant issues. In Hinduism, however, the 

            question is much harder to answer because there is neither a centralised 

            authority nor a single authoritative scripture on which all Hindus 

            agree. Jews, Christians, and Muslims all know exactly what is meant 

            by 'the Scriptures' in their tradition: the Hebrew Scriptures for 

            Jews; the Hebrew Scriptures ('Old Testament') and New Testament for 

            Christians, with some variation between branches over whether certain 

            inter-testamental texts called the Apocrypha should also be included; 

            and the <i>Koran</i> for Muslims. Scriptural authority for each tradition 

            derives solely from its respective canonical texts, with the use and 

            importance of that scriptural authority dependent on the tradition's 

            overall structure of authority: for Jews, Muslims, and Protestants, 

            extensive use and great importance of the authority of their scriptures; 

            for Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, relatively less 

            use and importance compared to the authority of the institutional 

            hierarchies. 

            <p></p>

            If we turn to Hinduism, we find a very different situation. There 

            is indeed a set of scriptures, the Vedas, whose authority is accepted 

            by all Hindus. This acceptance, however, has little to do with actual 

            use or even knowledge by most Hindus apart from the chanting of a 

            few Vedic mantras in rituals and a general awareness of the teachings 

            of the Upanisads. The Vedas from the beginning were primarily ritual 

            texts known in depth only by a small minority even of Brahmins and 

            largely unknown by most others - and of course prohibited to the majority 

            of the population who were not in the 'twice-born' classes. The only 

            non-ritual portions of the Vedas, the Upanisads, were likewise little 

            known as Vedic texts per se, but were known mainly through their appropriation 

            by philosophical schools (<i>darsanas</i>) such as Vedanta and Sankhya-Yoga. 

            There is no doubt that the Vedic texts, both ritual and philosophical, 

            have had enormous influence on the religious language and concepts 

            of Hinduism. In that sense the Vedas are authoritative and deserve 

            their traditional status as revealed truth captured in sound by the 

            ancient <i>rsis</i>. Nevertheless, they have not played a role in 

            Hindu religious life equivalent to that of the scriptures of Judaism, 

            Christianity, and Islam. That role has been taken by texts such as 

            the Epics and Puranas, whose authoritative status both individually 

            and collectively is one of the major issues in understanding authority 

            within Hinduism. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Authority in Hinduism </b> 

            <p></p>

            All Hindus would agree that the Vedas are authoritative, and in fact 

            this agreement is one of the major characteristics defining what we 

            mean by 'Hinduism.' Not all Hindus, however, agree on the authoritative 

            status of other texts that are central to the religious tradition 

            of some Hindus and marginal at best for some others. The most significant 

            texts in this category are the two great epics, the <i>Mahabharata 

            </i>and <i>Ramayana</i>, which have great importance especially for 

            worshipers of Krsna and Rama. Krsna appears often in the <i>Mahabharata</i>, 

            usually as a princely advisor to the Pandavas and the special friend 

            of the Pandava prince Arjuna, but he also appears in the section known 

            as the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>as the Supreme Lord who has created the 

            universe, controls the destiny of its beings, and teaches Arjuna the 

            path to salvation through devotion to Him. Rama is of course the hero 

            of the <i>Ramayana</i>. There is no doubt that these two epics lay 

            the foundation for the worship of Krsna and Rama, and they are accordingly 

            designated as authoritative scriptures by Vaisnava devotional traditions. 

            <p></p>

            Yet not all Hindus would agree on this designation in the same way 

            or to the same degree as they would to the claim of authority for 

            the Vedas. For some Hindus, for example, the <i>Mahabharata</i> is 

            considered 'The Fifth Veda,' while other Hindus consider this claim 

            an insult to the original Four Vedas (<i>Rg</i>, <i>Sama</i>, <i>Yajur</i>, 

            and <i>Atharva</i>), whose authority is unquestioned. Some would grant 

            the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>special authority - as does the Vedanta school, 

            which puts it on a par with the Upanisads - but would deny the same 

            authority to other portions of the epic. The same general pattern 

            applies to the <i>Ramayana</i>, which is a highly authoritative text 

            for some but not for others, although it does not have a special section 

            like the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>that has been granted independent authority. 

            As would be expected, those who worship Krsna and Rama give greater 

            authority to these two texts than do non-Vaisnavas, although even 

            they disagree on the relative degree of authority that should be given 

            to each. 

            <p></p>

            Even greater variation appears when we move to the next stage of Hindu 

            texts, the Puranas. While everyone would agree that there are only 

            two great epics regardless of what authority one grants them, there 

            is no such agreement even on the number of Puranas. Some eighteen 

            'Great Puranas' have traditionally been recognised by name, but there 

            is some dis­agreement over which of several lists of names is most 

            accurate and which existing texts correspond to the names listed. 

            Some of the Puranas are quite eclectic and advocate worship of many 

            different deities, while others are more sectarian. Of the sectarian 

            Puranas, some are primarily concerned with the worship of Siva and/or 

            various forms of the goddess Sakti, others with Visnu and His incarnations. 

            Given this uncertainty of status and variety of content, it is not 

            surprising that there are also great differences in the degree of 

            authority given to these texts by various Hindu groups. 

            <p></p>

            But who decides these matters? Once we move beyond the Vedas, there 

            is no unanimity within Hinduism on authoritative scriptures. Every 

            Hindu religious community nonetheless has its own recognised authoritative 

            scriptures in addition to the Vedas, and some grant them authority 

            equal to or even greater than the Vedas - or, as is sometimes the 

            case, consider them also Vedic and claim Vedic authority for them. 

            Where does this authority come from? It is not inherent in the texts 

            themselves, for then everyone would consider them authoritative. But 

            neither is it purely arbitrary, for then there could be no collective 

            agreement on the claimed authority over time. There must instead be 

            a resonance of some sort between the religious message of the text 

            and the religious needs of a particular Hindu community. Typically, 

            this happens when new religious leaders or new religious movements 

            stimulate religious activity that does not find adequate expression 

            or legitimisation in existing authoritative texts. The solution is 

            new texts that fit the new circumstances better than existing texts 

            and that can serve as a better foundation for the community's religious 

            life. 

            <p></p>

            Where do these new texts come from? Are they absolutely new in the 

            sense that they never existed before in any form, or are they only 

            newly revealed? The texts themselves say the latter, and typically 

            give a line of transmission from the authoritative - usually divine 

            - source to the final recipient, the one who makes the text available 

            to others in the present time and place. The authority of the text 

            thus depends on whether the source is considered authoritative and 

            whether the line of transmission is accepted as authoritative. A text 

            that meets both standards in the view of a given community is authoritative 

            for that community even though others may differ with its judgment. 

            The issue is ultimately a theological matter, or a matter of faith: 

            outsiders see only the moment when a given scripture appears historically, 

            while the community of faith sees its prior existence in a source 

            outside history. ISKCON, for example, accepts the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 

            the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, and the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> as 

            revealed scriptures because their authority has been affirmed by a 

            succession of teachers who themselves are considered authoritative 

            by the tradition in which ISKCON stands - i.e., the Caitanya branch 

            of the Vaisnava devotional tradition. This branch as a whole begins 

            of course with Caitanya, but there are a number of subsequent parallel 

            lineages or <i>guru-paramparas </i>tracing back to different early 

            disciples of Caitanya. ISKCON grants primary authority to one of these 

            lineages: the one that culminates in ­Bhaktivinoda Thakura, Bhaktisiddhanta 

            Sarasvati, and A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Since these teachers 

            are accepted as authoritative, their acceptance of certain scriptures 

            as authoritative puts these texts in a special category for their 

            followers. 

            <p></p>

            Not all authoritative texts within the tradition have the same importance 

            at any given time, however. The fact that this process has been going 

            on since Caitanya's time means that a great many authoritative texts 

            have accumulated within the lineage that may or may not fit the needs 

            of any given authoritative leader in his particular circumstances. 

            Bhaktivinoda Thakura, for example, spent much of his effort in the 

            nineteenth century sorting through the received tradition to determine 

            which texts had the most authority and the most value for ­Caitanya 

            devotees faced with the impact of modern Western culture, and he used 

            modern Western scholarly methods to date these texts and identify 

            their historical place in the tradition. He and his son Bhaktisiddhanta 

            Sarasvati translated and published many of the authoritative texts 

            that had been selected out by this process, establishing what was 

            in effect a modern collection of authoritative texts available as 

            far as possible in English translations as well as in Sanskrit and 

            Bengali. 

            <p></p>

            <b>Authority in ISKCON</b> 

            <p></p>

            Prabhupada, as ISKCON devotees know, continued this process with his 

            many English translations of authoritative texts, most notably <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 

            <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>, and <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. It should 

            be noted, however, that there were many authoritative texts within 

            his tradition that he did not translate or teach, either because he 

            had no time to do so or because he thought that his young Western 

            followers were not yet ready to understand them. In this he followed 

            the pattern of earlier teachers, all of whom had to be selective in 

            what they taught their followers. What this meant in practice is that 

            Prabhupada could hand on only part of the rich tradition of texts 

            known to Bhaktivinoda and Bhaktisiddhanta, just as they could transmit 

            only a portion of what was available to them. Any living tradition 

            always has an unexplored reserve of authoritative teachings and scriptures 

            from the past to be rediscovered, and ISKCON is fortunate to have 

            such a resource in abundance. It is ­certainly no criticism of Prabhupada 

            to look at the tradition that came before him for renewed insights, 

            because such discoveries only confirm the importance of his own authoritative 

            teachings that derived from that tradition. 

            <p></p>

            It should be noted that the pattern we find in ISKCON is similar in 

            many ways to what we find in other religions whose ultimate authority 

            comes from revelation. Judaism accepts the <i>Torah</i> as revelation 

            because it accepts the revelation of the Law to Moses at Sinai, a 

            divine act that confers authority on Moses and thus on the first five 

            books of the Hebrew Scriptures - the <i>Torah</i> or <i>Pentateuch</i> 

            - that are credited to him as author. The New Testament has authority 

            for Christians because of the authority of Jesus as the Christ or 

            Messiah, the related authority of his chosen disciples, and the authority 

            of Paul as an Apostle converted to Christianity by a divine revelation 

            after Jesus' death. The <i>Koran</i> has authority for Muslims because 

            it is a verbatim record of the revelations to Muhammad that marked 

            the beginning of Islam as a community of faith, and the <i>Hadith</i> 

            has authority because of Muhammad's authority as the Prophet of Allah. 

            <p></p>

            In all of these cases, the revelations are understood as divine truths 

            that enter history at particular times and places but are themselves 

            beyond history - i.e., their essential authority is in the divine 

            truths that they reveal, not in how or when they are received. Their 

            entry into history, however, means that they are received by particular 

            people in a historical time and place and have historical significance 

            - whatever their essential truth - only if they are considered authoritative 

            by those who receive them and by those to whom they are further revealed. 

            This process of accepting revelations as valid and confirming their 

            authority for a larger community necessarily takes time, because accepting 

            a revelation as authoritative has serious implications. 

            <p></p>

            In the case of Islam, the time before acceptance was only the few 

            years during which Muhammad - guided by the revelations that would 

            become the <i>Koran</i> - went from his initial obscure status in 

            Mecca to being the leader of an expanding community in Medina. The 

            Hebrew Scriptures, by contrast, evolved slowly and in stages over 

            more than a millennium between the time of Moses and the acceptance 

            of late additions to what would become the Jewish canon. In the third 

            century BCE, these Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek as 

            the Septuagint for use by Hellenised Jews, and it was this version 

            that was also used later by the early Christians as their authoritative 

            scriptures. The Hebrew Scriptures themselves remained the authoritative 

            texts for Jewish rabbis, however, and by the end of the first century 

            CE - perhaps as a response to the destruction of the Temple in 70 

            CE - they had established a canonical text that remained authoritative 

            from that point on. 

            <p></p>

            Christians had no authoritative scriptures except the Septuagint for 

            several generations after the death of Jesus. It was not until the 

            middle of the first century CE that the apostle Paul laid the foundation 

            for a specifically Christian set of scriptures with the first of his 

            many letters, and it was not until early in the second century that 

            most of the eventual contents of the New Testament had been produced. 

            These later materials included a variety of texts that had found acceptance 

            in Christian churches, among them four separate accounts of Jesus' 

            ministry and death (the Four Gospels) and an account of the ministry 

            of the early apostles (the Acts of the Apostles). These were not the 

            only Christian writings from this period, however, and for some time 

            there was no agreed procedure to distinguish them from other texts 

            - some of them also popular in the early churches - that represented 

            different theological views. It took until late in the fourth century 

            CE before there was general agreement on which of the circulating 

            texts had true 'apostolic authority' - i.e., represented the truth 

            revealed to the apostles by Christ and the Holy Spirit - and which 

            should be excluded from the canon because they lacked that authority. 

            <p></p>

            It is clear from these examples that accepting certain texts as authoritative 

            depends on more than the quality of the texts or the claims they may 

            make for their own authority. It depends also - and for practical 

            purposes, critically - on the recognition of the texts as authoritative 

            by some authoritative religious body. It is here that Hinduism differs 

            most from the three Abrahamic religions just described, because it 

            has no dominant institutional authority to confer such recognition. 

            Muhammad's immediate followers recognised the <i>Koran</i> as authoritative 

            even during his lifetime as they saw Allah's guidance leading them 

            to victory after victory and as Muhammad's teachings - later collected 

            as <i>Hadith</i> - transformed the moral and religious life of Arabia. 

            The Hebrew Scriptures took shape slowly over many centuries, but their 

            authority had been recognised by Temple priests and rabbis, the two 

            most authoritative Jewish religious groups, long before the rabbis 

            gave them canonical status in their final form. Christianity conferred 

            canonical status on its chosen scriptures with a series of Church 

            decrees in the fourth century that established an official New Testament. 

            There are no corresponding authoritative bodies in Hinduism, however, 

            and thus no process acknowledged by all Hindus to grant any given 

            scriptures canonical status. 

            <p></p>

            The Vedas represent something of an exception to the general rule 

            for Hinduism, but their recognised authority comes from a far distant 

            past when the central importance of Vedic fire sacrifices led the 

            performing priests to agree on a common body of mantras, ritual procedures, 

            and metaphysical concepts to support their activities. Once Vedic 

            fire sacrifices declined in importance and the great royal sacrifices 

            ceased with the rise of ­Buddhism and the Mauryan Empire, there was 

            no longer a dominant ritual institution to unify and support priestly 

            activity. The Vedic canon was effectively closed by the second century 

            BCE, and priests spent their creative intellectual energies after 

            that on new types of texts such as the Dharma Sutras and Dharma Sastras 

            (The Laws of Manu, etc.), the <i>sutras </i>of the emerging philosophical 

            schools, and texts supporting the new theistic movements centred on 

            Visnu and his incarnations. Priests also took over the role of editors 

            of the early bardic <i>Mahabharata</i> at about the same time, and 

            contributed new teachings to both this epic and the <i>Ramayana</i>. 

            Priests continued to learn the Vedas for their continuing ritual performances, 

            although most of their activity was now concerned with family <i>samskara 

            </i>rituals, and they brought much of their Vedic knowledge over into 

            their other intellectual pursuits, but they no longer constituted 

            a coherent authoritative body focused on a single common religious 

            purpose. 

            <p></p>

            Since the Vedic canon was closed, there has thus been no central Hindu 

            body with the authority to confer general canonical status on newly 

            revealed scriptures. But this also means that there is no central 

            body that can deny canonical authority to any given text. The recognition 

            of texts as true and authoritative has therefore depended for the 

            past two thousand years on more specific groups or traditions such 

            as Bhagavatas, Saivites, Saktas, worshipers of Krsna or Rama, etc. 

            There are as a result many Hindu texts that are authoritative for 

            some religious communities and not for others, or are considered revelation 

            by some faith traditions and have no value to others. This is true, 

            moreover, not only of scriptures that are considered divinely revealed 

            but also of the teachings - including poetry and songs - of various 

            saints and religious leaders expressing their own personal experiences: 

            the poetry of the Tamil saints known as the slvars, for example, the 

            writings of Ramanuja, the Marathi songs of Namdev and Tukaram, the 

            Braj poetry of Surdas and Mira Bai, or the writings of the Six Goswamis 

            in Vrndavana. To these and many other personal religious expressions 

            too numerous to mention might be added the many accounts of the lives 

            of saints and religious leaders such as the biographies of Ramanuja 

            and Sankara or the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, Krsnadasa Kaviraja's 

            monumental account of Caitanya's life and teachings. 

            <p></p>

            Given this situation, what does it mean for a Hindu text or scripture 

            to be authoritative? Unless we are talking about the Vedas, we have 

            to say that a given text is authoritative when a particular tradition 

            or a group within a tradition considers it to be authoritative - and 

            then, of course, it is authoritative only for them unless some other 

            group agrees to accept its authority. Vaisnavas in general may accept 

            the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> (the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>) 

            as divine revelation, but only some Vaisnavas would accept the slvars' 

            poetry of devotion to Krsna or the theology of the Goswamis - and 

            Saivites would likely reject them all. This pattern has given rise 

            to the concept of <i>sampradayas</i>, specific traditions within the 

            larger Hindu framework that accept the authority of particular scriptures, 

            worship particular deities, have particular religious practices, and 

            follow a particular line of teachers. It is even possible - in fact, 

            based on historical experience, likely - that divisions will emerge 

            within <i>sampradayas </i>over matters such as variations in ritual 

            practice, differing interpretations of scriptures, organisational 

            disputes, or a choice of one teacher and his lineage over another. 

            Such divisions are in fact apparent in contemporary Vaisnava institutions 

            such as the Gaudiya Mathas, and are potential problems even within 

            ISKCON. 

            <p></p>

            Hinduism is of course not the only religion to face such problems 

            of conflicting authority. We can especially see certain similarities 

            between Hinduism and Protestant Christianity in the absence of a central 

            institutional authority and the division over time into separate branches 

            representing different positions on basic religious issues. Although 

            Protestants claim the right of each believer and each church to interpret 

            scripture independently of central institutional authority, they nonetheless 

            recognise only the canonical Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament 

            as having scriptural authority. Protestants must therefore express 

            their religious differences through different interpretations of the 

            same scriptures, not by embracing scriptures outside the received 

            canon. Hindus have historically recognised no such limitation, and 

            have accepted numerous scriptures into the tradition since the Vedic 

            canon was closed. The only general Hindu requirement has been that 

            these new (or newly received) scriptures should not directly reject 

            the authority of the Vedas - although, as many examples from the <i>Bhagavad-gita 

            </i>and other literatures illustrate, they may criticise Vedic teachings 

            on certain issues. Certainly many scriptures have been more religiously 

            important and influential to most Hindus than have the Vedas, although 

            these scriptures are often represented as being extensions of the 

            Vedas or as being revelations from the same source, and thus respect 

            for the Vedas is preserved. 

            <p></p>

            But finally, who decides these issues of authority within the Hindu 

            tradition? In the absence of a central institutional authority or 

            a single recognised scriptural authority, each branch of Hinduism 

            - often, but not always, expressed in terms of <i>sampradayas </i>- 

            must settle its own issues of authority in its own terms. This means 

            among other things deciding which scriptures it accepts as authoritative, 

            how those scriptures are to be interpreted, what interpretation is 

            to be given precedence, what its religious practices will be and which 

            are most important, how its leadership will be organised, and what 

            teacher or lineage of teachers will have final authority. This is 

            more than a matter of deciding on a scripture or set of scriptures 

            or identifying with a particular <i>sampradaya</i>; it ultimately 

            involves choosing a teacher and thus a lineage of teachers, because 

            personal authority is always expressed in terms of the line of teachers 

            - the <i>guru-parampara </i>- on which that authority is based. 

            <p></p>

            This may require that the question of authority be constantly revisited 

            or renegotiated within Hinduism in general or within a particular 

            group or branch of Hinduism. There is no overall authority to decide 

            such issues, and the range of options is so great that problems of 

            authority almost inevitably arise. It is normal to feel the tension 

            between competing authorities and to wish that the tensions would 

            go away, but new problems of authority will certainly arise. What 

            has to be remembered is that all religious traditions have struggled 

            with problems of authority, and all of them still alive are still 

            dealing with them. For traditions as for organisms, the absence of 

            change is a sure sign of death. Change is the normal and essential 

            condition of living, and to change means to confront new challenges 

            - and each new challenge involves more often than not a change in 

            the existing balance of authority within the tradition. 

            <p></p>

            The issue of authority for any tradition is thus never finally settled. 

            If the scriptural authority is not in question, the interpretation 

            of scripture may be. Leadership will inevitably change and new issues 

            of authority will emerge. Since the world around it changes, the interaction 

            with it also will change and raise new questions about existing patterns 

            of authority. The question is not whether such issues and problems 

            can be avoided, which they cannot, but how they will be handled. This 

            of course also raises issues of authority, because dealing with new 

            issues may require drawing on sources of authority that are not now 

            being used. 

            <p></p>

            <p>Any tradition that has been around for centuries has many latent 

              resources, and an important part of the response to new challenges 

              is to seek sources of authority that may have been forgotten. No 

              tradition can use all of its potential resources at one time, and 

              no leader or teacher can pass on all that he knows or all that his 

              teachers and their teachers have known. It is the job of each generation 

              to recognise this and keep the full range of resources alive - i.e., 

              to recognise the richness of its inheritance from the past and make 

              use of the authority available there to solve current problems. 

              The best way to show respect for past leaders and past authority 

              is to respect the authority and the past that those authorities 

              respected and to draw on them all for the future. This is certainly 

              the task facing ISKCON at this moment, and its future depends on 

              how well it musters its resources for the continual process of rediscovery 

              and renewal. </p>
