            <p align=left class="maintextsubhead">Author: H.M. Kuitert<br>
              Publisher: SCM Press Ltd, London, 1993<br>
              ISBN: 034400746 
            <p>When we consider that the Christian faith has survived two thousand 
              years of change, despite being subjected to numerous cultural, historical, 
              philosophical and theological challenges we can not help but be 
              somewhat impressed. It is not surprising that Christians who are 
              aware of these challenges should raise questions concerning the 
              development of their belief system. H. M. Kuitert, a well-known 
              writer, broadcaster, and Dutch Reform Christian, attempts to answer 
              his own as well as the questions of others in his book, <i>I Have 
              My Doubts</i><i>-</i> <i>How to Become a Christian Without Being 
              a Fundamentalist</i>. As Kuitert himself explains, there is need 
              for a response when 'the Christian faith [is] in the supermarket 
              and, moreover, on special offer' (xii). When Christians are confused 
              by a multiplicity of faith concepts, reconstructions and updatings, 
              leading to the collapse of any unified notion of what Christianity 
              is, it is no wonder that so many feel uncertain about their own 
              faith. A possible solution to their anxiety is to embrace fundamentalism. 
              But for many, this alternative is even more fearful and unacceptable 
              than their own confusion. Though it is especially for those Christians 
              who are unwilling to either lose their faith or accept fundamentalist 
              traps that Kuitert believes that his methodology would be equally 
              valuable for the members of any other tradition-ISKCON included-facing 
              a similar plight. 
            <p>As he explains, his offering is neither a highly emotional individual 
              expression, nor an apology, nor complete dogmatics. Rather, he lays 
              out in an easy style (a) what he believes, (b) why, (c) and what 
              is to be done with it. Since this is not a systematic theology that 
              requires abstract and precise language, his tone is conversational- 
              as he says, 'just talking'. This in no way makes his work any less 
              well reasoned or tightly structured. His method is to raise questions-and 
              he raises all the questions that could possibly be asked-and selectively 
              investigate possible responses. He avoids none of the central Christian 
              tenets: the transcendence of God, the importance of Christ, the 
              Church, prayer, commandments and authority of the Bible. In fact, 
              he structures his book on the Apostles' Creed, affirming its commitments, 
              not as a fundamentalist, but in the liberal tradition. 
            <p>He makes clear his liberal persuasions in the book's first section. 
              He objects to any doctrinal system that claims a total view of God-an 
              attitude that makes pluralism impossible. For different religious 
              traditions to accept each other as equals, they must agree that 
              they are creations of man, not God. Genuine dialogue will be thwarted 
              if any party appeals to revelation-an appeal that automatically 
              excludes non-believers. The source of religious truth is not the 
              supernatural; human experience makes it capable of improvement. 
              A tradition of faith is appropriated from past generations and bequeathed 
              to those of the future. One must distinguish faith from belief; 
              the latter being fallible, and thus relative to time, place and 
              circumstance. For a tradition to remain vital, it must constantly 
              reinterpret-find appropriate metaphors-for the beliefs that it has 
              inherited. 
            <p>Having laid the foundation for the liberal rationale, Kuitert applies 
              his views to the primary subject of God. He traces the Christian 
              knowledge of faith and God through its Jewish and Greek roots, to 
              its ultimate origin in the human inborn need to explain existence 
              and be devoted to something higher. Humans attribute to God absolute 
              qualities, which they possess relatively. The Christian God was 
              sketched as someone who could be called upon personally, someone 
              who wants us back. Here, the transparent metaphor of patriarchy 
              betrays a male-centred culture, as other metaphors presuppose a 
              pre-industrial world. Another metaphor that seems time-bound is 
              to address God as king or master before whom we are subjects or 
              slaves. Kuitert emphasises that we must find metaphors appropriate 
              to our own times and needs which still preserve God's special place 
              in our lives. 
            <p>Kuitert attempts to sort out the relationship between God the Creator, 
              humanity and the world. His intention is to help us resolve the 
              tensions that arise when modernity confronts tradition. Tradition 
              tells us that God was originally pleased with creation, yet there 
              is more evil in the world today than ever before. Is man habitually 
              sinful or is God the source of evil? The historical sequence of 
              creation, fall and redemption, as provided by tradition is no longer 
              a meaningful solution. Instead, the historical sequence of evolution 
              not only provides an alternative to creation; it demonstrates that 
              sin is not hereditary. Then should God be blamed? Kuitert rejects 
              various 'rescue' attempts such as Marcian and Deism, among others. 
              Nor is he entirely satisfied with Luther's solution: God does evil 
              but does not really mean it. Kuitert's answer is to have God share 
              the blame with humans. Something bad can also come from God. But 
              human freedom requires that we assume responsibility for the consequences 
              of our selfishness because it is anxiety that leads us to sin, all 
              of which is due to our forgetfulness of God. 
            <p>Human nature, a 'nature' that no longer accords with ancient Israel 
              or Aquinas' twelfth-century morality, must be understood in the 
              context of our own times. Man may be made in the image of God, but 
              that image does not mean identical appearance. Nor is Jesus and 
              his life a normative model. Our equality with God may be best understood 
              in terms of a common task: we are stewards on behalf of a providential 
              God whose purpose we cannot always know, but whose true face can 
              be seen in the words and acts of Jesus Christ. We encounter God 
              by engagement in this world-an engagement that is often painful, 
              yet is part of the providential order of a God who will ultimately 
              welcome and embrace us. Though there may be terrible evil in the 
              world, salvation will not be found by attempting to find shelter 
              inside the Church, for God is encountered in the ordinary life outside. 
            <p>Kuitert focuses next on the central role of Jesus Christ, a topic 
              that raises various questions. Though these questions have plagued 
              Christianity from the very beginning, freeing themselves from literalism 
              allows liberals like Kuitert to find solutions consistent with modernity. 
              The identity of Jesus has been especially enigmatic, lending itself 
              to many explanations. How can a human being be God at the same time? 
              The Gnostic doctrine of the Prince in disguise reduced Jesus to 
              the mere clothing of God. The orthodox doctrine of two natures-one 
              person in whom divine and human natures are united-was meant to 
              counter the Gnostics. And the doctrine of the Trinity was meant 
              to show that God personally suffered for us. But neither doctrine 
              was acceptable to the Jews or Muslims who insisted on an absolute 
              monotheism. Both doctrines rest on the christological presupposition 
              that Jesus is no ordinary messiah-he is the other face of God the 
              Creator. Or, as Kuitert explains, Jesus is 'occupied' by God. 
            <p>Such a Christology depends upon the Resurrection. But this raises 
              yet another question: did the Resurrection factually take place? 
              Kuitert tackles the question culturally. For the narrators of Jesus' 
              time who believed in miracles, it was possible. But because it defies 
              the laws of nature, as we now understand them, it no longer fits 
              our sense of reality. In any case, it could not mean bodily resurrection. 
              Nor is the Ascension to be understood literally as Jesus sitting 
              at the right hand of God. God does not have a right hand, Kuitert 
              explains, nor does Jesus sit anywhere in the universe. Ascension 
              is a metaphor for position of power, while resurrection, far from 
              being a corporeal resuscitation, is a recreation. Jesus is the first 
              sample-a model to show us how, when dying, we will be taken out 
              of time if we are reconciled with God. Redemption both from our 
              sins and the guilt that alienated us from God is achieved by the 
              'substitution' of Jesus, the sacrificial lamb, for the sinner. Reconciliation 
              means a new life-a new person is born. There is no hell where sinners 
              are tormented eternally. And what of election? 'Utter nonsense', 
              Kuitert says. Determinism and fatalism are not true Christian concepts. 
              Predestination was Calvin's misunderstanding. We are held accountable 
              for our life, especially for how we treat humanity, and the final 
              judgment is entrusted to Jesus Christ. 
            <p>The Church has been the traditional mediator between the believer 
              and God and has also regulated relationships between believers. 
              Its has often proved disappointing, as Kuitert indicates: 'Jesus 
              meant the kingdom of God, and what came? The Church' (179). Kuitert 
              is concerned with understanding the Church's role and how it may 
              exercise regulation without exerting force. That the Church is the 
              dwelling place of God, hence infallible, is an article of faith. 
              How a person sees their role or how they identify themselves often 
              reflects their view of the Church: 1) I am <i>different</i> / the 
              Church is the kingdom of God on earth; 2) I am <i>saved</i> / the 
              Church is Noah's ark; 3) a <i>mystical union</i> with Christ / the 
              Church is the body of Christ; 4) I am one of God's <i>elect</i>; 
              5) a <i>soldier</i> of Christ; 6) a <i>pilgrim</i> passing through 
              the world; 7) a <i>pioneer</i> turning the earth into the kingdom 
              of God. 
            <p>Kuitert acknowledges the Church's importance in providing doctrine, 
              continuity, place, community-even grace. What he insists is that 
              its position be free of power and pretension, and that its leaders 
              maintain their members' loyalty by freedom, not force. Most of all, 
              he insists that 'the Church is there for the world, not &quot;before&quot;, 
              but for' (190). This complements his belief that God is encountered 
              in the ordinary affairs of daily life. He would wish that the walls 
              that separate the Church from the world be broken and that the notion 
              of salvation only for those inside be abandoned. His advice to missionaries 
              reflects openness and humility: mission should be done with respect 
              for the missioned while relating it to oneself. Pluralism without 
              requires pluralism within so the Church must encourage diversity 
              (which will avoid splintering) by demanding loyalty rather than 
              obedience. 
            <p>Rituals, especially those which are elevated to sacraments, are 
              one way a faith tradition ensures continuity. Kuitert appreciates 
              the value of rituals so long as they still have meaning. Unfortunately, 
              many no longer fulfill their original purpose-no longer speak to 
              the people, bind them together or create a sense of obligation. 
              Kuitert emphasises a recurring theme that these rituals were born 
              out of a different time when the religious community was alienated 
              and not a part of this world. Symbols like the cross are all that 
              are left of the sacraments and they too have lost their value. The 
              telling request of a girl asking for a chain with a cross on it-' 
              &quot;No, I mean one with a little man&quot;'-proves his point (133). 
              Sacraments, Kuitert reminds us, are not 'natural' objects of experience, 
              but artificially constructed encounters. It is best to find God 
              in life rather than in sacraments which exclude all but insiders. 
            <p>Clearly for Kuitert the Church is not synonymous with the kingdom 
              of God. To the question, 'Where is heaven?' Kuitert responds, 'No 
              where'. It is beyond whatever we can call a place. Therefore we 
              must start to build our eternal home <i>here</i> by 'this-world 
              asceticism'. Not by making the world 'churchly', but by taking the 
              earth seriously. Then is the kingdom of God a utopia ('u' = 'not'; 
              'topia' = 'place'; hence, 'no place')? Is it something that does 
              not exist now but will in the future? Kuitert tells us to put such 
              worries aside. Before a New World can come there must be new persons, 
              persons cleansed of sins. The gracious gift of remission of our 
              sins and guilt will be demonstrated by our care for others. When 
              our present life ends we can exchange our body for a life in God. 
              And here Kuitert shows his deep faith in tradition: we must believe 
              that God is faithful to eternity, who offers us eternal friendship 
              in a New World as a new person, beyond the horizon of time. 
            <p>That God is someone like us, someone who notices us. Otherwise 
              why do we pray? But is prayer really effective? Many feel it is 
              a form of magic, a wasted effort, boring, selfish and a burden to 
              God, or requires our certainty and enough time-both of which we 
              lack. Kuitert believes prayer is a way of saying, 'Help!' It is 
              an act of humility, arising when there is need. It is we who are 
              helped, not God. Nor is it meant to influence God-it is like 'knocking 
              on the door of someone who already knows' (246). When we pray silently, 
              God talks. Disciplined prayer produces a disciplined life. 
            <p>Morality is also necessary for a Christian life, but it is not 
              necessary for salvation. But the problem with moral codes, like 
              all else we have inherited from our grandparents, is that they no 
              longer suit us. Kuitert considers whether there are any fixed moral 
              points on which we can pin our actions. Calvin distinguished ceremonial, 
              civil and moral commandments. The last as summed up briefly in the 
              Ten Commandments, are good for all times. While Kuitert appreciates 
              that the Ten Commandments were formulated in a timeless way, he 
              believes they are historically and culturally determined. Though 
              based on the knowledge of good and evil that is self-evident, they 
              are man-made, often changing, even crumbling. In their appeal to 
              scripture they demand obedience for fear of reprisals rather than 
              fostering insight. Kuitert appreciates Christianity's offer of love 
              as a balance for moral commandments. Morality is a means of finding 
              God's will, but is never equal to God's will, for that would be 
              slavery. 
            <p>Though he does not view the Bible as infallible, Kuitert pays it 
              profound respect. As the oldest form of the Christian 'puzzle-picture' 
              of God, he believes the Bible to be the most mistreated and misused 
              book in our culture. Rather than adhering to a doctrine of inspiration, 
              he prefers a view that does not bind the Bible but leaves it free 
              to be interpreted by every reader or listener. It 'contains what 
              Israel thought of God and what the evangelists and apostles-by way 
              of addition-thought about Jesus. No more and no less' (284). As 
              such, it is not meant to prescribe what we must think, but to provide 
              food for thought. 
            <p>Kuitert has intentionally saved a specific discussion of the Bible 
              for last for good reason. Though his book is full of the Bible, 
              he has not appealed to its authority to prove any of his points. 
              For a person so well versed in the history of doctrine and dispute, 
              to present his case entirely through the voice of commonsense speaks 
              more than volumes of proof texting. This, after all, helps to establish 
              one of his fundamental themes: faith is what we experience personally, 
              not second hand. Personal experience, broadened to include society 
              and tradition, is thus the final court of appeal. 
            <p>Kuitert's faith is impressive, for it withstands the test of his 
              endless questioning. His questions are not only his own but are 
              asked on behalf of more traditionally orthodox Christians as well 
              as those now alienated. No stone is left unturned. He asks questions 
              inherent in the tradition itself, questions which have arisen due 
              to changes of culture and context, and questions stemming from the 
              confusion caused by practices which no longer make sense. His abiding 
              faith allows him to interrogate the tradition with the belief that 
              by doing so it will permit us to go forward, though all doubts may 
              not finally be removed. 
            <p>Kuitert seems to have succeeded in forging a middle path between 
              conservatism and liberalism. It is not surprising, therefore, that 
              his book after coming out in 1992 was on the Dutch bestseller list 
              for thirty-six weeks, and number one for no fewer than fifteen! 
              He takes the contents of the tradition quite seriously-maintaining 
              the reality and transcendence of God and the centrality and normativeness 
              of Christ-the great affirmations of the gospels. But he is against 
              any institutions that tell us what to believe as they enslave Christianity 
              in a legalism of beliefs. Each of us has to make choices, not based 
              on what authorities tell us, but on the various interpretations 
              that ring true in our daily lives. To hold on to beliefs that don't 
              work is sheer stubbornness, superstition, ignorance. Though we may 
              not have absolute faith or morality or righteousness, God's graciousness 
              can carry us forward. 
            <p>Kuitert's unassuming tone conceals an intricate pattern of well-reasoned 
              arguments as much as it reveals his genuine concern for Christ's 
              mission. He succeeds not only in reaching a wide Christian audience, 
              but even members of other traditions like myself, find his tone 
              appealing. His doubts, after all, are those of a believer. Though 
              they may be expressed in Christian terms, his questions and answers 
              have certain universality, which provide insight into how it is 
              possible to be loyal to one's tradition while subjecting it to intense 
              scrutiny. 
            <p>Who can deny, for example, that scripture requires further explanation? 
              Why else are there so many commentaries? Whether the truth descends 
              by special revelation or is arrived at by the ascending process 
              of general revelation may, of course, be debated. Undoubtedly, any 
              tradition claiming privileged access to the truth will have difficulty 
              seeing itself as an equal partner in dialogue with others. This 
              is why Kuitert sees the need to level the field by applying ground 
              rules all can follow. Traditions that are more authority dependent 
              are more resistant to change than those that are experientially 
              based. They are likely to seclude themselves from the world of change, 
              believing that God is encountered within the church more easily 
              than outside. This view does not take the world nearly as seriously 
              as Kuitert would wish. For such persons, the world and this life 
              are seen as but a means to serve an other-worldly end. Such a view 
              gives little importance to historical progress and it may see societal 
              changes in terms of moral regress. The social models described in 
              scripture are taken as normative and any differences are evaluated 
              negatively. This causes a tradition to become still more insular 
              as a means of ensuring the fidelity of its members. 
            <p>A literal reading of scripture would insist that models of God 
              are not man-made creations made relative by a particular culture 
              or time. Such a reading would also assign objective reality to heaven 
              and hell- places beyond our ordinary perception. These views find 
              little resonance with Kuitert, though he would not deny that they 
              are still meaningful to many. In fact, it is these very views which 
              have made him doubt so much. Without freely questioning, there is 
              little likelihood he could have preserved his faith. What makes 
              his solutions attractive to those even more conservative than himself 
              is his affirmation of the bedrock of Christian faith. All but the 
              most hard-core fundamentalists should acknowledge this and recognise 
              his efforts as part of the broader Christian mission. He has lessened 
              his own doubts and the doubts of numerous others; for many, Kuitert's 
              evangelical liberalism rings true.

                    <p>The Alchemical Body excavates and centres within its Indian 

                      context the lost tradition of the medieval Siddhas. Working 

                      from a body of previously unexplored alchemical sources, 

                      David Gordon White demonstrates for the first time that 

                      the medieval disciplines of Hindu alchemy and hatha-yoga 

                      were practised by the same people, and that they can only 

                      be understood when viewed together.&nbsp; White opens the 

                      way to a new and more comprehensive understanding of medieval 

                      Indian mysticism, within the broader context of South Asian 

                      Hinduism, Jainism and Islam.

                    <p>This book offers useful insights into the complex and internally 

                      diverse realm of Hinduism. It is intended to acquaint the 

                      reader with themes and issues that, while of relevance to 

                      all religious traditions and systems, contribute to an understanding 

                      of the abstract nature of Hinduism as a whole. Beginning 

                      with Hindu religious understandings of the human condition, 

                      the chapters are arranged so as to form a thematic survey 

                      and overview of Hindu religious beliefs and practices. The 

                      themes of morality and ethics, the role of women in Hinduism, 

                      the Hindu religious construction of nature, and issues such 

                      as mythology, the status of texts, forms of worship, and 

                      sacred time and place can be systematically considered; 

                      or, alternatively, focus can fall upon those topics that 

                      are of particular personal interest. Readers should find 

                      this book a wide-ranging and balanced introduction to Hinduism's 

                      inner diversity.</p>

                    <p>What is one to make of a group of goddesses that includes 

                      a goddess who cuts her own head off, a goddess who sits 

                      on a corpse while pulling the tongue of a demon, or a goddess 

                      who prefers sex with corpses? Tantric Visions of the Divine 

                      Feminine deals with a group of ten Hindu Mahavidyas, who 

                      embody habits, attributes or identities usually considered 

                      repulsive or socially subversive.&nbsp; It is within the 

                      context of tantric worship that devotees seek to identify 

                      themselves with these forbidding goddesses.&nbsp; The Mahavidyas 

                      seem to function as 'awakeners' - symbols that help to project 

                      one's consciousness beyond the socially acceptable or predictable. 

                    <p>Kinsley not only describes the eccentric qualities of each 

                      of these goddesses but seeks to interpret the Mahavidyas 

                      as a group and to explain their importance for understanding 

                      Tantra and the Hindu tradition.

                    <p>No religion ever remains static: it affects and is in turn 

                      affected by material reality.&nbsp; It is the creative tension 

                      embodied in this dynamic which makes the world of religion, 

                      rich with possibilities. 

                    <p>This book examines the contours of this creative tension 

                      in the context of Hinduism in our own times. For Hinduism, 

                      a religion of unknown antiquity is also, in several ways, 

                      surprisingly modern. Hinduism for Our Times is an attempt 

                      to raise this dimension of Hinduism to an unprecedented 

                      level of self-awareness.&nbsp; Thus the choices that Hindus 

                      must make in the context of modernisation and globalisation 

                      become conscious as opposed to random choices, choices which 

                      will place Hinduism at the cutting edge of the contemporary 

                      world instead of consigning it to the periphery.&nbsp; This 

                      book will appeal to all those interested in giving religion 

                      a modern agenda.
