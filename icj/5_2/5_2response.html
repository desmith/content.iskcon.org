            <p>It was good to see a scholar tackling the uncertain area of morality 
              in Vaishnavism, as did Ms Chatterjee with her essay, 'The Chaitanya 
              School: Role of Ethics', in the last issue of this journal. I found 
              her essay thought provoking and a valuable contribution to what 
              I feel is an area requiring much discussion. Although, as Ms Chatterjee 
              rightly pointed out, Vaishnavism holds that 'spiritual progress 
              is hardly possible without moral endeavour', the first requirement 
              being of course the 'four regulative principles', it is still somewhat 
              hazy, especially amongst ISKCON followers, exactly what our code 
              of ethics should be. Do we follow <i>varnashrama dharma</i> or not? 
              Are Vaishnavas transcendental to all external designations and thus 
              the duties pertaining to them? How much is a Vaishnava serving Krishna 
              to be bound by codes of worldy morality? 
            <p>Of course, one would expect a Vaishnava to display the highest 
              moral character, and indeed Ms Chatterjee's first point was that 
              one who surrenders completely to the Lord will thereby attain similar 
              qualities as those possessed by the Lord. In other words, by virtue 
              of their surrender to God, Vaishnavas should naturally evince all 
              godly qualities. She cites some of the many scriptural verses supporting 
              this point, describing how a genuine sadhu or saintly person will 
              evince superlative standards of morality. 
            <p>From our experience in ISKCON, however, we have seen that such 
              morality is sometimes lacking amongst our members. Even though we 
              are a society dedicated to the service of God, we still have to 
              deal with, from time to time, cases of moral turpitude. From my 
              own experience as a temple leader and National Secretary of the 
              Society in the UK, I have seen many such cases, ranging from disputes 
              over property ownership, to sexual transgressions, accusations of 
              deceit, and well as various other things. When these instances arise 
              we often find ourselves dealing somewhat arbitrarily. That is to 
              say, we do not refer to any systematic codes of behaviour. Of course, 
              where there are direct and obvious statements made in our scriptures 
              then these are followed, but for the most part such directions are 
              few, and more often than not it is left up to a group of devotees, 
              or perhaps even just the temple leader, to arbitrate. 
            <p>Obviously, there is a need for a clear set of guidelines to enable 
              us to deal consistently with misbehaviour in the Society. Every 
              society has its laws and codes of ethics, but in ISKCON this is 
              presently lacking, despite our being a society based upon the tenets 
              of scripture. These days, of course, morality is becoming something 
              more dependent upon circumstance and <i>vox populi</i> than anything 
              else, the so called 'moral relativism'. But all laws and moral codes 
              were originally derived from scripture. The Ten Commandments, for 
              example, are the original basis of law in Christian countries. All 
              scriptures offer comprehensive moral guidelines which are still 
              followed to a greater or lesser degree in most civilised societies. 
              However, in ISKCON we have no systemised code derived from our own 
              scriptures, the Vedas, and are thus often solving our moral conflicts 
              either by expedience, that is, moral relativism, or by a mix of 
              whatever Vedic morality we may have imbibed, along with our previous 
              training in other moral codes, perhaps Christianity or some other 
              religion. 
            <p>The Vedas do provide many moral guidelines, although, as I mentioned 
              earlier, there are not so many in the Vaishnava scriptures such 
              as <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and <i>Shrimad Bhagavatam</i>. Again, this 
              is because it is assumed that from the very beginning a Vaishnava 
              will already be on the highest platform of morality, indeed transcendence. 
              He simply has no interest in mundane pleasures. Srila Prabhupada 
              sometimes made the point that Krishna in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              does not tell Arjuna not to steal, or to covet another's wife. Why? 
              Because for a man like Arjuna there was no question of such behaviour, 
              but what do we do if we find that aspiring 'Arjunas' in the Society 
              still have such tendencies? Although Ms Chatterjee makes the point 
              correctly that Vaishnavas are transcendental to mundane morality, 
              this also implies that, as with Arjuna, they are beyond and above 
              any moral misbehaviour. If we are seeing the latter then the assumption 
              of transcendence cannot be made, and we need to think about the 
              application of moral codes. 
            <p>In applying Vedic moral guidelines, however, there are some knotty 
              problems. For example, one of the most famous and comprehensive 
              texts of morality is the <i>Manu Samhita</i>. I often hear ISKCON 
              devotees citing it, and in fact in the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> Shrila 
              Prabhupada says that executive leaders in society should be familiar 
              with this book (Bg 3.21 purport). But how do we apply it now? So 
              much of that text seems to only have application to a time long 
              past and an entirely different culture from that of today. Parts 
              of it would even be impossible to apply as it calls for punitive 
              measures which are simply not acceptable in today's society. Nor 
              do we know if these measures should be applied anyway, as it is 
              clear from studying Vedic moral texts that they have varying applications 
              according to different times, places and circumstances. Although 
              it may sound similar, this is not the 'moral relativism' as it is 
              known today. Vedic morality, unlike modern moral relativism, is 
              always based upon scripture, but there needs to be a skilled interpreter 
              of the scripture who is capable of applying it appropriately. In 
              classical Vedic society this would of course be the king and his 
              ministers, advised by well-read brahmana counsellors. Such persons 
              are in rather short supply at the moment. 
            <p>Perhaps the biggest problem though, is that the <i>Manu Samhita</i>, 
              and indeed the entire system of Vedic morality, depends upon the 
              division of society into varnas and ashramas, the traditional occupational 
              and spiritual castes. There are different moral codes for all of 
              the different castes. But again that is hardly acceptable today, 
              as it conjures up ideas of enforced casteism, leading to the abuse 
              and exploitation of the so-called lower classes. That is the present 
              experience in India, at least. The remains of the Vedic <i>varnashrama</i> 
              system as it is seen today in India is not something anyone would 
              want to emulate quickly. If <i>varnashrama</i> is to be re-introduced 
              in ISKCON or anywhere else, it would have to be in a quite different 
              way to India today, and it would need to take into account the reasons 
              why the system in India became degraded into its present lamentable 
              condition. 
            <p>Clearly there are no quick and easy solutions to the problem of 
              finding a workable code of ethics based upon the Vedas. Perhaps, 
              just as Shrila Prabhupada adapted even the Vaishnava practises to 
              suit his followers in today's society, someone or some group of 
              persons will need to adapt the system of Vedic morality from books 
              like the <i>Manu Samhita</i>, and other such standard texts. 
            <p>We can start by researching ISKCON's canon to see what its founder 
              Shrila Prabhupada said on the matter. From my own research I see 
              at least that he frequently calls for the application of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i>. Also, as with the above cited quote from the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> 
              he does expect that there will be moral guidance given by the leaders 
              in society, based upon Vedic texts. And from our own experience, 
              as I began by saying, we are already seeing the need. A need which, 
              in my view, will be felt more and more strongly as ISKCON grows. 
            <p>In conclusion then, whilst I think Ms Chatterjee has made some 
              good points about the morality of Vaishnavas, I also think we need 
              to take a more realistic view of our present society of Krishna 
              devotees, at least ISKCON. I feel she has dismissed <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> too lightly and I would like to see more discussion on 
              how this system can be implemented properly in ISKCON. I would also 
              like to see us trying to understand texts such as the <i>Manu Samhita</i> 
              and how they can be applied today. In that way I would hope we could 
              provide a working example of something better than moral relativism; 
              a framework of ethics and morality based upon the teachings of the 
              Vedas.
