            <p align=left><i>This paper was presented at a conference in <br>
              Torino, Washington, 1, December 1997.</i> 
            <p>When in the United States it was suggested that religious liberty 
              should become an issue in foreign relations, immediate references 
              were made to Asian or African countries such as China, North Korea 
              or Sudan. Recently former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe, 
              including Russia, have also been added to the list. Scholars of 
              minority religions, however, know that serious problems also exist 
              in some countries in Western Europe. In Europe some religious movements 
              certainly have perpetrated serious crimes, for example the suicides 
              and homicides of the Order of the Solar Temple in Switzerland in 
              1994 and in France in 1995 have caused widespread social concern. 
              We certainly do not suggest that religious movements guilty of common 
              crimes should not be vigorously prosecuted. However, the Solar Temple 
              incidents have been used as a catalyst in a number of countries 
              to propose actions against literally hundreds of groups thrown together 
              under the label of 'cult'. In the wake of the Solar Temple, a dangerous 
              ideology, hostile to religious minorities in general, seems to have 
              made inroads in political and administrative circles of western 
              European nations. In this paper I will examine these developments 
              from a scholarly perspective, arguing that these developments will 
              and have already damaged the rights of ordinary law abiding citizens 
              in certain countries, and that certain governments need to seriously 
              reconsider their policies towards religious minority groups in light 
              of the information presented in this paper. 
            <p>Part I will examine how this intolerant perspective has come about 
              with such prominence by examining the main tenets of this ideology. 
              Then we examine some details some of the results of the ideology 
              in Western Europe, mostly in the form of parliamentary commissions 
              and reports (Part II). After the examination of some examples (Part 
              III), some final suggestions are offered (Part IV). It is important 
              that while the European Parliament prepares to vote its own resolution 
              on 'cults', an international dialogue on religious minorities takes 
              place involving all parties concerned, including those who care 
              about religious liberty. 
            <p> <b>Part I. The Rise of an Intolerant World-view</b> 
            <p><i>Redefining 'Religion<br>
              </i>In present-day Western Europe few would admit to being against 
              religious liberty, and this list would certainly not include governments 
              or parliamentary commissions. However, in recent times discrimination 
              against unpopular groups has been allowed to take place by redefining 
              the notion of 'religion'. While most scholars favour a broad definition 
              of religion (for example, as a system of answers to the basic human 
              questions about the origins and destiny of humans), institutional 
              definitions by political and judicial sectors are often result-oriented. 
              For instance, a decision rendered by the Court of Appeal in Milan, 
              Italy, on 2, December 1996, in order to deny the Church of Scientology 
              the status of a religion, defined religion as 'a system of doctrines 
              centred on the presupposition of the existence of a Supreme Being, 
              who has a relation with humans, the latter having towards him a 
              duty of obedience and reverence'. On 8, October 1997 the Italian 
              Supreme Court annulled this Milan decision made in 1996, castigating 
              its theistic definition of religion as 'unacceptable' and a 'mistake', 
              because it is 'based only on the paradigm of biblical religions' 
              and would exclude a number of mainline religions, including Buddhism. 
              It is true that theologians, sociologists and historians have proposed 
              different definitions of religion. It is, however, difficult to 
              avoid the impression that in some European countries today, the 
              selection of a set of criteria among the many that are available 
              are governed primarily by whether an organisation deserves protection 
              or punishment. Only broad definitions of religion appear to be consistent 
              with the aims of religious liberty embodied in a number of national 
              constitutions, international declarations and conventions. 
            <p><i> The myth of brainwashing and mind control<br>
              </i>One of the older, more established and most effective rhetorical 
              tools used to claim that a religious group is not 'genuine', is 
              by the claim that they do not have voluntary membership. Anti-Mormon 
              propagandist, Maria Ward, claimed in 1855 that Mormon conversions 
              were obtained only through '. . . a mystical magical influence . 
              . . a sort of sorcery that deprived me of the unrestricted exercise 
              of free will.'<a href="#1"> 1</a> In fact, Ward argued, Mormons 
              used the secret of 'mesmerism' taught to their founder, Joseph Smith, 
              by 'a German peddler'. The reference to 'magical influence', 'sorcery' 
              and a non-existing German Mesmerist allowed anti-Mormons such as 
              Ward to deny Mormonism the status of religion. Since religion is, 
              by rhetorical definition, an exercise of free will, a non-religion 
              may only be joined under some sort of coercion. 
            <p>The same hypnotic paradigm has been applied, more recently, in 
              order to distinguish between 'religions', joined voluntarily, and 
              'cults', joined only because of what was once called brainwashing 
              (which has now been renamed as mind control, mental manipulation 
              or mental destabilisation, since the label has been discredited 
              by mental health scholars). 
            <p>In the United States, theories of brainwashing and mind control 
              applied to religious minorities have been debunked for at least 
              ten years. The American Psychological Association (APA) in 1984 
              allowed Margaret Singer, the main proponent of anti-cult mind control 
              theories, to create a working group called Task Force on Deceptive 
              and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC). In 1987 
              the final report of the DIMPAC Committee was submitted to the Board 
              of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology of the APA. 
              On 11, May 1987 the Board rejected the report and concluded that 
              the mind control theories used in order to distinguish 'cults' from 
              religions are not part of accepted psychological science. The results 
              of this document were devastating for the validation of mind control 
              theorists. 
            <p>American courts have consistently rejected testimonies about mind 
              control and manipulation since the Fishman case in 1990. In this 
              case a defendant accused of commercial fraud claimed as his defence 
              that he was not fully responsible, since he was under the mind control 
              of Scientology. The court stated that mind control theories are 
              not part of accepted mainline science. Brainwashing and mind control 
              theories are, indeed, not part of psychological or social science. 
              They lack empirical evidence, and are a mere tool used in order 
              to deny the status of religion to groups perceived as deviant or 
              subversive. 
            <p>These American developments, on the other hand, are not well known 
              in western Europe. Although with different nuances, and dismissing 
              the word 'brainwashing' as inadequate and old-fashioned, even official 
              documents by parliamentary commissions rely on the faulty model 
              distinguishing between religions and 'cults' on the basis of manipulation 
              and mind control. 
            <p><i>Apostates<br>
              </i>Mind control theories are part of a rejected knowledge consistently 
              repudiated by the academia, professional associations and courts 
              of law. It is, however, argued that scholarly objections are less 
              relevant than the 'testimony' of 'former members' who claim that 
              'cults' are indeed joined because of manipulation and mind control. 
              It is unclear why the accounts of one or another 'former member' 
              should be accepted by official political bodies, including parliamentary 
              commissions, as more relevant by definition than scholarly research. 
              Additionally, a misunderstanding about the very notion of 'former 
              members' is perpetuated, and plays a key role in the public stigmatisation 
              of minority religious movements. While parliamentary reports and 
              sensationalised media accounts claim to rely on the 'testimony of 
              former members', we learn invariably that, for each religious movement, 
              only a very limited number of 'former members' have been heard by 
              the parliamentary commissions, the courts or the press. 
            <p>Sociological research suggests that among thousands of former members 
              of any large organisation (no matter how controversial) only a small 
              minority become 'apostates' (a technical, not a derogatory term). 
              Not all former members are apostates. An apostate is a former member 
              who reverses loyalties dramatically and becomes a professional enemy 
              of the organisation he or she has left. Most former members do not 
              become apostates. They remain-in sociological terms suggested by 
              David Bromley and others-'defectors', members who somewhat regret 
              having left an organisation they still perceive in largely positive 
              terms, or 'ordinary leave-takers' with mixed feelings about their 
              former affiliation. However, ordinary leave-takers (and, to some 
              extent, defectors) remain socially invisible in so far as they do 
              not like or care to discuss their former affiliation. Apostates, 
              being more visible, are mistaken for the genuine representatives 
              of the former members. In fact, quantitative research shows that 
              even in extremely controversial groups, apostates normally represent 
              less than 15% of former members. 
            <p><i>Anti-cult movements<br>
              </i>If apostates are only a minority of former members, it begs 
              the question why they are so often the only ones interviewed by 
              parliamentary commissions or the media? The logical answer is that 
              they either volunteer to be heard, or are directed to testify by 
              an oppositional coalition. This is, in fact, the role of the so-called 
              anti-cult movement. Modern anti-cult movements (in opposition to 
              older Christian counter-cult coalitions) are defined as primarily 
              secular organisations fighting 'cults' based on the brainwashing 
              or mind control paradigm. The recent lack of institutional and academic 
              support for mind control theories has caused a serious crisis for 
              the American anti-cult movement. In 1996 the largest American anti-cult 
              organisation, the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), filed for bankruptcy. 
              An anti-cult movement, however, does continue to exist in the United 
              States and in fact, claims that its accounts, although rejected 
              by scholars, are validated by 'former members' (namely apostates). 
            <p>Currently in Western Europe anti-cult movements (particularly ADFI 
              in France, whose offices also serve as European headquarters for 
              FECRIS, a Europe-wide federation of anti-cult movements) experience 
              a degree of institutional support unknown in the United States. 
              These well organised anti-cult movements-particularly in France, 
              Germany and Belgium- have successfully introduced the mind control 
              model to the press and to political bodies unfamiliar with the fact 
              that this model has been discredited in the United States. When 
              scholarly criticism of the mind control model is opposed to the 
              anti-cult movements, it is dismissed on the basis of the testimony 
              of 'former members'. In some countries, including France, anti-cult 
              movements have considerable resources and operate with the help 
              of taxpayers' money. They are responsible for spreading misleading 
              information about a number of religious minorities. 
            <p>The anti-cult organisation is usually not composed of scholars 
              and they offer information-perhaps in good faith-that is simply 
              not updated. Unfortunately, the consequences may be catastrophic. 
              To mention only a few examples, in the early 1990s the international 
              anti-cult coalition instigated police raids in a number of countries 
              against The Family (formerly known as the Children of God), based 
              on practices The Family had in fact discontinued for a number of 
              years. Based on this false information, children were separated 
              from their mothers, and adults as well as the children were taken 
              into custody (inter alia in France and Spain) for weeks and even 
              for months. Later, courts dismissed the charges, recognising that 
              the information was either inaccurate or not updated, and castigated 
              the anti-cultists. In Barcelona, Spain, Judge Adolfo Fernando Oubina 
              in his decision of 22, May 1992 went so far to compare the actions 
              against The Family to 'the Inquisition' and 'the concentration camps'. 
              The legal decisions, although important, does not compensate the 
              adults and the children for what was an unnecessary nightmare. 
            <p>Another example of how inaccurate, dated information may easily 
              mislead authorities concerns Tabitha's Place, the French branch 
              of the Messianic Communities (a communal group originating from 
              the Jesus Movement and headquartered in Island Pond, Vermont). The 
              mother community in Vermont, the Northeast Kingdom Community Church, 
              was raided in 1984, based on rumours of child abuse spread by local 
              anti-cultists. However, no evidence of child abuse was found and 
              the case was dismissed. By 1994, the Vermont community, although 
              maintaining a strict Christian fundamentalist lifestyle, enjoyed 
              a peaceful coexistence with neighbours and authorities. Unaware 
              that similar charges were dismissed in the USA ten years earlier, 
              the anti-cult movement in south-western France started a campaign 
              against Tabitha's Place (a community that, in turn, had existed 
              peacefully near Pau for more than ten years with no incidents). 
              Charges of child abuse were carelessly repeated and the community, 
              continuously harassed by police and tax authorities, struggled for 
              its very existence. 
            <p>In April 1997 a twelve-month child died of congenital heart problems. 
              The parents were arrested for possible abuse, although a team of 
              twelve doctors who examined the community's children concluded that 
              there is no evidence of any abuse. It is possible that the infant's 
              parents were not fully aware of the possibilities of surgery. However, 
              the criminal case against them is being prosecuted within the frame 
              of a general climate poisoned by rumours spread by anti-cultists 
              on the basis of claims raised and dismissed in the US over a decade 
              before the French situation. They also rely on the testimony of 
              only one apostate, who spent just a few days at Tabitha's Place.<a href="#2">2</a> 
            <p><b>Part II. The Results</b> 
            <p>In the United States the Jonestown tragedy of 1978 was the catalyst 
              for an increase of anti-cult activity. The anti-cult worldview (described 
              in Part I above) became widespread, but the activities of the anti-cult 
              movement were ultimately kept in jeopardy by the reactions of the 
              academia, mainline Churches and some of the religious minorities 
              themselves. In Europe, as mentioned earlier, the suicide-homicides 
              of the Order of the Solar Temple, repeated twice in the 1994 and 
              1995 (and a third time in 1997-but only in Quebec) enacted the same 
              role Jonestown played in the United States. The anti-cult movements 
              were energised and authorities started considering them more seriously. 
              Discredited theories such as mind control surfaced again. Parliamentary 
              commissions with a mandate to study the 'danger of cults' were established 
              in a number of countries. Without examining all the results of this 
              activity, here are some relevant examples. 
            <p><i>France<br>
              </i>After a number of secret hearings a parliamentary commission, 
              composed solely of members of Parliament, issued a report entitled 
              'Cults in France' (10, January 1996). It is important to note that 
              not a single scholar was consulted in the whole process; their expertise 
              would be vital in producing an objective picture of the real danger 
              of the groups in question. It included a laundry list of 172 dangerous 
              cults. It did not recommend new legislation, but suggested a number 
              of administrative actions and the establishment of a national Observatory 
              of Cults (in fact established in 1996, with only two extreme anti-cultists 
              as 'experts'). 
            <p>Although not technically a source of law, the report has already 
              been quoted in court decisions and has led to discrimination against 
              a number of groups. Teachers have been fired from public schools 
              after years of honourable service only because they were members 
              of the Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the most dangerous 'cults' according 
              to the report. A Roman Catholic theatrical group, the Office Cultural 
              de Cluny, included in the report as a 'dangerous cult' against letters 
              of protest of a number of French Catholic bishops, was nearly bankrupted 
              due to the refusal of public theatres for its shows. 
            <p>The city of Lyon has decided not to allow the use of public facilities 
              to any group listed in the report as a 'cult'. Each French Department 
              now has a 'Mr Cult' employed by the Ministry of Youth and Sport 
              (often well connected with the anti-cult group ADFI) to tell the 
              cultural and sport organisations about the evil of the cults. The 
              anti-cult milieu is recommending actions by the Observatory against 
              groups mentioned in its literature or in the report but not included 
              in the list (particularly the Mormon Church and the Catholic Charismatic 
              Renewal). Other groups are defined as 'cults' by the report (including 
              the Baptists), but nevertheless called 'benign 'cults', a contradiction 
              since the report starts by defining a 'cult' as a dangerous organisation. 
            <p><i>Switzerland<br>
              </i>Following an intensive anti-cult campaign in the wake of the 
              Solar Temple and the French report, in February 1997 the Canton 
              of Geneva released a report written by four lawyers after interviewing 
              different personalities (one scholar only). The report is organised 
              in chapters, each signed by one of the lawyers. While, at least 
              in some chapters, the report is written in a more moderate style 
              than the French one, the proposals are even more dangerous, advocating 
              legislation against 'mind control' and against hiring members of 
              'dangerous cults' as government officers. 
            <p>The Canton of Geneva Commission released its proposals on 24, May 
              1997, following up the February report. The most significant are: 
              to promote an inter-cantonal conference in order to persuade other 
              Cantons to follow the example of Geneva; to enact cantonal legislation 
              in order to, inter alia, fund the anti-cult organisations and allow 
              them to become parties in cult-related trials; to create a Cantonal 
              observatory including, among others, two representatives of anti-cult 
              organisations, two scholars, and two 'representatives of cults' 
              (although it is unclear how the latter will be selected); to promote 
              federal Swiss legislation making mind control a federal felony. 
            <p><i>Belgium<br>
              </i>The Belgian parliamentary commission on cults released its report 
              on 28, April 1997. This document is even more extreme than the French 
              report. It included a number of bizarre allegations against many 
              groups including five mainline Catholic groups, among them: the 
              Catholic Charismatic Renewal, Quakers, the YWCA (but, for some reasons, 
              not the YMCA), Hasidic Jews, and almost all Buddhists. It also proposes 
              legislation making 'mind control' a crime. 
            <p>Reactions by scholars and mainline Churches have determined some 
              turmoil in the Belgian Parliament and in the end it has vetoed the 
              report itself but not the list of 189 groups included as an appendix. 
              This was a symbolic victory for the scholars, but most of what is 
              disturbing in the report is not only in the list, but also in the 
              main body of the text. 
            <p>Following the report legal actions have been taken against a Tibetan 
              Buddhist group, a Catholic religious congregation called the Work, 
              (a Belgian group now headquartered in Rome, not to be confused with 
              Opus Dei, also mentioned in the report)-notwithstanding vigorous 
              protests by the Vatican and by Belgian bishops. The report also 
              calls for the dissolution of Sukyo Mahikari, a Japanese Shinto-based 
              religious minority whose branches in countries such as Italy and 
              United States have existed for decades without any trouble for public 
              order. 
            <p>Based on the testimony of apostates, extreme allegations have been 
              made against dozens of groups. Serious concern has been expressed 
              by scholars, inter alia about the accusation that Satmar Jews (a 
              Hasidic community, based in New York and regarded as a 'cult' by 
              the report) 'kidnap children and hide them within the international 
              network of the movement'. This seems to be based on the Patsy Heymans 
              case, where a Belgian Catholic woman, having obtained custody of 
              her three children, had to recover them from her Satmar ex-husband 
              who was keeping them illegally in the United States. However, the 
              Heymans case is not specifically mentioned in the report. The parliamentary 
              document rather states that kidnapping children 'does not seem to 
              be merely occasional' among this group of Hasidic Jews.<a

 href="#3">3</a> The inclusion of these general remarks in a parliamentary document 
              may easily add fuel to the fire of anti-Semitism, whose continued 
              presence raises concern in a number of European countries. 
            <p><i>Germany<br>
              </i>A parliamentary commission has been established including MPs 
              and experts appointed by the different political parties. They have 
              conducted hearings with scholars, anti-cultists and members of a 
              number of religious movements. An interim report was released in 
              June 1997. Although not final (and not including lists) the report 
              raises some serious problems. In the meantime, without consulting 
              the parliamentary commission, the government placed the Church of 
              Scientology under watch of the local secret service. Even groups 
              largely critical of Scientology have criticised the decision as 
              a dangerous precedent, while local anti-cultists have already named 
              the Jehovah's Witnesses as the second group that should be watched 
              by the secret service. Police raids instigated by the same anti-cultists 
              have occurred against small independent Pentecostal churches. 
            <p><i>European Parliament<br>
              </i>The Parliament has entrusted the Committee on Civil Liberties 
              and Internal Affairs with the task of preparing a report. Following 
              criticism of the French and Belgian report by scholars (inter alia 
              in a seminar organised by CESNUR, an independent organisation of 
              scholars committed to researching new religious groups and providing 
              accurate, unbiased information on them, at the European Parliament 
              in Strasbourg on 13, May 1997), the Committee initially produced 
              a draft with a number of positive features, questioning inter alia 
              of the usefulness of preparing lists of 'cults'. However, following 
              anti-cult pressure, amendments were introduced during the final 
              debate within the Committee, and further amendments may be introduced 
              during the plenary discussion of the European Parliament. Thus, 
              anti-cult ideas initially rejected by the Committee may re-enter 
              the document. 
            <p> <b>Part III. Case Studies</b> 
            <p>There are literally hundreds of religious minorities discriminated 
              against or persecuted in Western Europe. They belong to all possible 
              religious and spiritual persuasions. We have selected, as examples, 
              two cases, concerning comparatively small French groups, which are 
              not well known outside France. They could hardly be more different 
              from each other. The Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon 
              is an example of how a group whose theology is clearly main line, 
              and would be regarded as main-line in most Western countries, is 
              marginalised after an encounter with the anti-cult movement. As 
              mentioned earlier, a number of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish groups 
              have suffered the same fate. The second example is the Aumist Religion 
              (not to be confused with the Japanese Group Aum Shinri-kyo). It 
              is headquartered at the Mandarom, Southern France and could hardly 
              be less mainline. Its theological ideas are at the very fringe of 
              the French religious scene. It is not difficult to understand why 
              it has been easy to make the Mandarom extremely unpopular. However, 
              constitutional guarantees are aimed, precisely, at protecting unpopular 
              minorities. And even the most unpopular defendant should be guaranteed 
              the due process and a fair trial. 
            <p><i>The Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon<br>
              </i>The Protestant scenario in Western Europe is slowly becoming 
              as diversified as the one in the United States. Large liberal denominations, 
              members of the World Council of Churches (WCC) no longer represent 
              the majority of Protestantism in a number of European countries. 
              Literally hundreds of Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, often 
              with a conservative theology, have flourished. The large number 
              of new churches- and new names-may easily confuse the authorities. 
              As usual, anti-cultists propose very simple solutions. 
            <p>In France CCMM (Center Against the Mental Manipulations, the second 
              largest anti-cult group after ADFI) explicitly claims that all groups 
              not belonging to the WCC, or to its corresponding French organisation, 
              the French Protestant Federation, are suspicious and may possibley 
              be 'cults'. Word games are easily played. In fact, the derogatory 
              word in French is not 'culte' (the literal translation of 'cult') 
              but 'secte'. The latter word may literally be translated as 'sect' 
              but rather plays the same role as the English word 'cult'. In fact, 
              the French word 'secte' has today two very different meanings. Books 
              from sociologists of late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
              are still republished, where the word 'secte' is used, without any 
              derogatory meaning, simply to identify small denominations or groups 
              that are not (or not yet) regarded as part of the mainline by the 
              majority churches. On the other hand, for the general public 'secte' 
              is rather used, in the sense of the 1996 parliamentary commission, 
              to identify a dangerous religious (or, rather, 'pseudo-religious') 
              movement using mind control techniques. As the noted historian and 
              sociologist Emile Poulat accurately remarked about the Pentecostal 
              Evangelical Church of Besançon, that this church 'may be a &quot;secte&quot; 
              in the sense of Weber [an early German sociologist of religion]; 
              it is certainly not a &quot;secte&quot; in the popular and parliamentary 
              sense of the term.' <a href="#4">4</a> Yet, Evangelical and Pentecostal 
              Churches are easily labelled as 'sects' in the popular sense of 
              the term, that is 'cult' in contemporary English. 
            <p>The Belgian parliamentary report takes quite literally the anti-cult 
              recommendation to target every Christian group not endorsed by the 
              WCC. Its list includes Seventh-day Adventists,<a href="#5">5</a> 
              Amish, the Assemblies of God, Calvary Christian Center, Plymouth 
              Brethren, the 'Charismatic Renewal' in general and a number of small 
              independent Pentecostal Churches. 
            <p> The French report limits itself, among hundreds of independent 
              Churches, to a dozen names. Curiously enough, the French report 
              mentions the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon (EEPB) and 
              ignores the Evangelical Missionary Federation, founded on the basis 
              of the success of the Besançon church and now including more than 
              thirty churches. In fact, not unlike other groups, the EEPB seems 
              to have been included in the report for one simple reason based 
              on a family conflict between a pastor and his father-in-law and 
              since then the EEPB has been targeted as a 'cult' by the anti-cult 
              movement CCMM, particularly since 1994. Due to the peculiar status 
              of the anti-cult movement in France, the accusations have been spread 
              by the press (in previous years, quite favourable to EEPB) and up 
              to the parliamentary commission. 
            <p>Among hundreds of independent churches with very similar theologies, 
              only those specifically targeted by an anti-cult movement (often 
              for very local or personal reasons) have ended up being included 
              in the report. In fact, the EEPB is just another Evangelical Pentecostal 
              church. Its founder, Pastor René Kennel, studied at Nogent-sur-Marne's 
              Institut Biblique and started his career in 1950 as a Mennonite 
              part-time preacher. He later welcomed the Pentecostal Gypsy Movement 
              of Pastor Le Cossec (a member of the mainline French Protestant 
              Federation) to his family farm. Impressed by the gypsies' enthusiasm 
              Kennel started a Pentecostal ministry and in 1967 became a full-time 
              pastor. In 1975, Kennel joined with Le Cossec to establish the Evangelical 
              Free Pentecostal Federation (FELP). In 1977, he became the pastor 
              of a Pentecostal independent church in Besançon, the present-day 
              EEPB. In 1986, Kennel abandoned his position as president of FELP 
              in order to oversee the planting of daughter churches of EEPB in 
              the region. These churches are the basis of the Evangelical Missionary 
              Federation (FEM), incorporated under French Law in 1989. 
            <p>The doctrinal statements of the EEPB are quite typical of hundreds 
              of Evangelical Pentecostal churches. The accusations raised by the 
              CCMM and the media influenced by it-literal belief in the existence 
              of the Devil, in miracles, speaking in tongues-could be easily used 
              against countless Pentecostal or Evangelical churches. It is possible 
              that church leaders, unfamiliar with legal matters, made some mistakes 
              when preparing the by-laws and the articles of incorporation, thus 
              exposing the church to potential problems with the French tax authorities. 
              On the other hand, it is a fact that the French Revenue Service 
              only took action after the anti-cultists had started targeting EEPB 
              as a 'cult'. 
            <p>When, in July 1994, an ex-member who was visibly drunk damaged 
              the furniture of the church belonging to the Evangelical Missionary 
              Federation in Langres, anti-cultists (and a part of the press) quickly 
              took the side of the apostate, presented as just another 'victim' 
              of a 'cult'. Paradoxically, before and after being labelled a 'cult' 
              by the parliamentary commission, the EEPB had always been able to 
              maintain its pastors, for health and retirement insurance purposes. 
              In the lists of CAMAC-CAMAVIC the social fund for pastors in France 
              are largely controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, including ministers 
              of all the mainline Christian churches. In the meantime, however, 
              the fact that they were on the parliamentary list of 'dangerous 
              cults' threatened the very existence of EEPB and of the whole FEM. 
              It is not only the continual media pressure against the 'cult', 
              but following administrative instructions enacted in the wake of 
              the parliamentary report, it has been denied public halls for meeting 
              by local authorities, and furthermore, the French Revenue Service 
              is continually harassing this struggling minority. 
            <p>The saga of EEPB confirms that in the present French scenario it 
              is not enough to preach a mainline Christian theology in order to 
              avoid the label of a cult. A minor incident is enough to be blacklisted 
              by an anti-cult movement, and unfortunately the black-lists of the 
              anti-cult movements easily become the black lists of the media and 
              the government. 
            <p><i>The French Aumist religion (the Mandarom)<br>
              </i>The French Aumist Religion, whose legal structure is called 
              the Association of the Triumphant Vajra, headquartered in its holy 
              city of Mandarom (hence the popular nickname of 'The Mandarom'), 
              is not only regarded by anti-cultists and by a sizeable part of 
              the French media as a cult, it is a cult, particularly in southern 
              France. This is, in itself, an interesting phenomenon. The Aumist 
              Religion is not a very large group, with less than one thousand 
              members in France and a smaller constituency in Italy, Quebec, Belgium, 
              Switzerland and Africa. The holy city of the Mandarom-described 
              as the very epitome of the 'danger of the cults' and a base threatening 
              a whole country-does not include more than fifty residing monks. 
            <p>The Aumist Religion (the name comes from the sacred Eastern sound 
              AUM, the only common element with the Japanese Aum Shinri-kyo) has 
              been founded by Mr Gilbert Bourdin, a native of French Martinique. 
              In the early 1960s he was initiated by the Indian master Sivananda 
              and started gathering followers as an ascetic practising austerities 
              in Southern France. He also became quite well known as a Yoga teacher 
              and author. In 1967, he established the Association of the Knights 
              of the Golden Lotus (replaced in 1995 by the current Association 
              of the Triumphant Vajra) and in 1969 he founded the holy city of 
              the Mandarom. Gradually, Bourdin revealed himself as the Messiah: 
              the Lord Hamsah Manarah. In 1990 he was publicly crowned as the 
              Messiah at the Mandarom; some of the ceremonies were open to the 
              media. At that time the movement hoped to crown the existing constructions 
              at the Mandarom (temples representing all the great religions of 
              the world and huge statues) with a larger Temple-Pyramid, a building 
              of great spiritual and cosmic significance for the Aumists. 
            <p>The public ceremonies of 1990 were interpreted as an arrogant challenge 
              by the anti-cult movement and the media. The Mandarom with its huge 
              constructions was, simply, too visible. Two TV networks started 
              a campaign exposing the Mandarom as a 'cultic concentration camp'. 
              Among the anti-cult activists emerged militant psychiatrist Jean-Marie 
              Abgrall. He went on record on TV commenting, about Aumism, that 
              'notwithstanding what they claim, cults are not religious movements, 
              but rather criminal movements organised by gurus who use brainwashing 
              to manipulate their victims', a nice summary of the anti-cult ideology. 
            <p>The campaign against the Mandarom was largely organised by ADFI, 
              and from 1992 it was joined by an ad hoc ecologist group led by 
              Mr Robert Ferrato. The latter claimed that the Mandarom disturbs 
              the ecological equilibrium of the mountain where it is built, and 
              called for its destruction. As mentioned earlier, anti-cult activists 
              are taken more seriously in France than in other countries, and 
              even an extreme character such as Dr Abgrall managed to become one 
              of the two 'experts' in the national observatory of Cults established 
              in 1996. 
            <p>The Mandarom was raided repeatedly between 1992-1995 by tax and 
              police officers in a military style. ADFI, Mr Ferrato, and a reporter 
              for the TV network TF1, Bernard Nicolas, played a keyrole in making 
              an apostate, Florence Roncaglia (whose mother is still with the 
              Mandarom), 'remember' that she had been molested and raped by Bourdin 
              in the 1980s. A complaint was filed in 1994, just before the expiration 
              of the legal delay. Later, three other female apostates also 'remembered'. 
              Based on Roncaglia's complaint, the Mandarom was raided again on 
              12, June 1995 and Bourdin was arrested. Coincidentally, at the same 
              date the French Council of State should have rendered its final 
              decision on the question of building permission for the Temple-Pyramid. 
              The decision was finally unfavourable to the Aumist Religion. On 
              30, June 1995, Mr Bourdin was released and the procedure against 
              him is still pending. 
            <p>For the Aumists, the fact that the Temple-Pyramid can no longer 
              be built is extremely serious. They are also concerned with the 
              climate surrounding the prosecution against their leader, the latest 
              of which manifested in October 1997 in the media comments about 
              the criminal procedure against a local politician, Pierre Rinaldi, 
              for alleged corruption in connection with the building of the road 
              leading to the Mandarom. 
            <p>The case of the Mandarom raises important questions. There is little 
              doubt that the claims the Aumists make for their founder are quite 
              extreme. Generally speaking, claiming to be the Messiah does not 
              make any religious leader particularly popular. The Aumist literature 
              combines eastern themes and western esotericism, and it is difficult 
              to distinguish between actual and symbolic claims (for example, 
              it is argued that the Messiah has destroyed millions of devils threatening 
              Planet Earth; these and similar claims are routinely quoted by anti-cultists 
              in order to ridicule the Mandarom). In short, Mr Bourdin is an unpopular 
              religious leader, and Aumism is an unpopular minority. This circumstance 
              makes Aumism an excellent case to test religious liberty in France. 
              When a group is protected by its own popularity, there is no need 
              for constitutional or international guarantees. 
            <p>The scholars who have taken the time to study the Mandarom (many 
              are simply scared away by controversy) have raised doubts about 
              the possibility for Bourdin to obtain a fair trial. They certainly 
              do not suggest that sexual abuse by pastors or religious leaders 
              should be condoned. They agree that it should be vigorously investigated 
              and prosecuted. Some comments made by scholars about the Mandarom 
              case are, however, enough to raise concerns about how the authorities 
              have mishandled the situation. 
            <p>First, the local judges do not seem to be familiar with doubts 
              raised in the United States and elsewhere about belated memories 
              of sexual abuses surfacing after many years in therapy or within 
              the frame of national controversies. In fact, in the last few years, 
              US courts have dismissed most cases of the so-called 'recovered 
              memories'. It is, in fact, too easy to accuse public figures of 
              sexual abuses allegedly taking place ten or fifteen years ago. 
            <p>Secondly, it is questionable that the Court of Digne regarded it 
              as necessary to appoint an expert to investigate 'the doctrines 
              and practices of the Mandarom and their connection, if any, with 
              the facts of the case against Mr Bourdin'. The Court of Digne appointed 
              Dr Jean-Marie Abgrall to carry out this investigation to confirm 
              their suspicions. He is not only a militant anti-cultist but an 
              author who has written in a book that Bourdin is 'a fraud', 'a paranoid' 
              and that Aumism is a 'clownesque caricature of a cult'.<a href="#6">6</a> 
              The verdict of a similar 'independent expert' has been rendered 
              in advance. 
            <p>Finally, irrespective of the personal problems of Mr Bourdin, one 
              wonders why, in connection with his prosecution, the Mandarom has 
              been repeatedly raided Waco-style by paratroopers, and a number 
              of members of the movement, though not Mr Bourdin himself, have 
              been handcuffed and taken into custody even though no charges have 
              finally been filed against any of them. 
            <p>Scholars are often asked whether there is a risk that groups such 
              as the Mandarom may become involved in violent confrontations with 
              the authorities or commit mass suicides like the Solar Temple. They 
              normally answer that the Aumist doctrine is firmly against violence 
              and suicides. This is, however, only part of the story. Writing 
              on the situation at the Mandarom, an Italian scholar Luigi Berzano 
              (a professor of sociology at the University of Turin and a Roman 
              Catholic priest) mentioned the sociological theories of amplified 
              deviance.<a

 href="#7">7</a> According to these theories, the hostile official responses to 
              a movement regarded as deviant may, in fact, amplify its deviance. 
              In a sense-as suggested in the US debate by Passas and others- the 
              movement is 'deformed' by official and anti-cult harassment. Excessive 
              reaction against a movement, thus, becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy 
              and may cause the very evil it is supposed to avoid. 
            <p> <b>Part IV. Suggestions</b> 
            <p>While it is not for scholars to recommend specific policy attitudes, 
              some general suggestions seem to be in order. 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>It should be clear from our report that Asia, Africa and Eastern 
                Europe should not be the only areas of concern when religious 
                liberty risks are evaluated. At least three countries in the European 
                Union (France, Belgium and Germany) should be considered at risk 
                (with the addition of Greece, where the problems are however more 
                similar to those prevailing in Eastern Europe). </li>
              <li>A primary cause of concern in these countries, is the public 
                sponsorship of private anti-cult movements. It is abundantly clear 
                that these movements are responsible for spreading misleading 
                and often simply false information about religious minorities 
                creating an intolerant world-view. </li>
              <li>It should be clarified that disgruntled apostates, no matter 
                who sponsors their claims, are but a minority of the larger population 
                of ex-members of any given religious minority, and should not, 
                without further investigation, be considered as representative 
                of ex-members in general. </li>
              <li>It is a cause of serious concern that myths discredited and 
                debunked in the United States about brainwashing and mind control, 
                thanks to the promotion by the anti-cult lobby, are still taken 
                seriously in certain European countries. They need to be exposed 
                as pseudo-science. </li>
              <li>Words are not neutral. Words such as 'cults' (or 'sectes' in 
                French or equivalent words in other European languages) are easily 
                used as tools of hate and discrimination and should be avoided, 
                particularly in official documents. Scholars often use 'new religious 
                movements'. Although better than 'cults', even this language can 
                cause misunderstandings about movements which are new only in 
                the West while they represent a century-old-tradition in the East 
                (such as ISKCON, popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement, 
                or Soka Gakkai, part of the mainline tradition of Japanese Nichiren 
                Buddhism). The most neutral term is 'religious minorities'. It 
                avoids judgements about whether a group is acceptable, or is connected 
                to an old tradition. </li>
              <li>Nothing in this report should suggest that laws should not be 
                enforced against criminal actions perpetrated within the frame 
                of old (or not so old) religious movements. The experience shows 
                that there are, in fact, dangerous and even criminal religious 
                groups. In case of common crimes (a different thing from the imaginary 
                crimes of 'belonging to a cult' or 'using mind control techniques') 
                the suspects should be investigated and prosecuted as criminal 
                suspects, not as members of religious minorities.</li>
