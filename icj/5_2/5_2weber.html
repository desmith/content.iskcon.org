            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>Until very recently in Germany, studies have not been undertaken 
              on the theological basis of the International Society for Krishna 
              Consciousness (ISKCON). Prior to this, the task was mostly left 
              to the polemics of religious policy, and needless to say, the subsequent 
              consequences proved to be highly problematic. The combined forces 
              of active religious polemics against ISKCON, and the lack of scholarly 
              research into the theology of this movement has greatly diminished 
              the chances of producing an objective analysis. Moreover, it has 
              only succeeded in producing a barrier to creating an open atmosphere 
              in which dialogue can legitimately take place. 
            <p>There has been some cause for optimism in Germany as the freedom 
              to practice religion as a basic human right has gained increasing 
              respect. Recently, the alliance of aggressive forces against religious 
              tolerance has ended, leaving room for a public and differentiating 
              discussion between the participants, reinforcing a freer and more 
              competent inter-civil dialogue about spiritual matters. 
            <p>The rejection of an inter-civil dialogue on spiritual affairs however, 
              undermines an effective democracy, which subsists on the continuous 
              confrontation of free citizens with their common culture, and this 
              is especially important with the ultimate questions of human existence. 
              Moreover, the success of an inter-civil confrontation can be guaranteed 
              if the participants in the dialogue respect their mutual freedom 
              as citizens, and take the mutual dialogue among citizens as a basic 
              starting point. This is the only way to attain a reasonable range 
              of solutions to a changing society. 
            <p>A constructive discussion in society about the new religious situation 
              in Germany has been impeded by suppressing the science of religion. 
              Today, the study of religion in Germany has a surprisingly more 
              liberal impetus in the universities, enabling a broader theological 
              research. There is a clear indication, not only of reform within 
              ISKCON, but also in the churches that are setting about discussing 
              multi-religious topics on a higher level. 
            <p>As a contribution to this inter-civil dialogue, the following is 
              a theological analysis of the religious culture practised by German 
              citizens involved with ISKCON and their impact upon our culture. 
            <p><b>1. Subject and Aim of Diacritical Theology<br>
              </b>There are many understandings of theology and for this reason 
              it is necessary to explain what it is and where it should and should 
              not be engaged. Theology is not a religious ideology of a particular 
              community that argues the interests of social organisations, but 
              is a universal science. It is not limited to a certain religious 
              culture or form of society, but is committed to its specific subject.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#1">1</a> 
              Such an autonomous theology has the task of <i>discrimen inter legem 
              et evangelium</i>-the diacritical analysis of Law and Gospel according 
              to the description of its function by Martin Luther. We will follow 
              these basic categories of diacritical theology and explain them 
              here.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#2">2</a> 
            <p><i>The Law: man's relationship to God and to his neighbours<br>
              </i>In traditional theological ethics, Law is described as the absolute 
              demand to love one's neighbour with all one's heart. This definition 
              presupposes that which Martin Luther calls the human possibility 
              of free love.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#3">3</a> This freedom of 
              loving God and man is not the subjective freedom of making a decision 
              to love, but rather its objective natural quality of absoluteness 
              and self-esteem- its actual ability to satisfy human existence. 
              According to theological ethics man owns the natural force to love 
              unconditionally and to experience in it the perfection of his existence. 
              Perfection is nothing but the pure effulgence of natural energy. 
            <p>The continuous task of religion is to liberate love to allow it 
              to be experienced as a fulfilment in life. The enforcement of charitable 
              work, whether done from free or conditioned motivation, however, 
              is the task of politics. But the only means to realise religion 
              and policy is through the mind, that is, by means of the universal 
              wholeness of all human faculties. 
            <p>The fact that Law is manifested as a claim in man's social and 
              individual existence is due to the factual dominance of the idea 
              of conditional love, the righteousness by work. Law in the sense 
              of theological ethics does, however, not just demand the realisation 
              of love, but also its free realisation; or in other words it demands 
              the renunciation of the existential determination of the righteousness 
              by work. Law contradicts the realisation of free love by challenging 
              its claim. 
            <p><i>The Gospel: God's relationship to man<br>
              </i>The Gospel, however, does not contain any claim or aim. No human 
              condition is meant other than, theologically speaking, for God's 
              reality: God's free love of His creation, and the Gospel, the subject 
              of theological dogmatism, transfers this internal Divine reality. 
              By the agency of the Gospel God states that He was free, is free 
              and will be free in His love to the world. The Gospel reveals its 
              power in that way by revealing the paradox of the use of human works 
              to reach perfection in God's relationship to man, who by no means 
              can neither reduce nor enforce this relationship. 
            <p><i>The Distinction<br>
              </i>The distinction between both <i>verba dei</i>, concepts of theology, 
              is necessary because otherwise in the human mind the idea of the 
              freedom of love would be suspended. Martin Luther calls this suspension 
              'righteousness by work'. This is the fundamental idea that the sense 
              of human life may be constituted by works alone. The result of this 
              imagined self-made dependence on one's own works, results in a transubstantiation 
              of free love into religious prostitution in the human mind. This 
              commercial loving relationship relegates God to free love, and makes 
              man capable of freely loving only the goddess of commercial righteousness. 
              Thus God becomes an agent of this righteousness, and man either 
              its beneficiary or its victim. 
            <p>The existential catastrophe of this concept of man and God is that 
              because God's free love is distorted, consciousness is deprived 
              of the only opportunity of overcoming the lack of freedom. Using 
              human works for un-natural purposes represents a closed system of 
              views from which there is no possibility of escape. It is through 
              this system of irreducible, contingent revelation of the absolute 
              freedom of God's love and its unconditioned truth, that the determination 
              of living life without changing the actual living practice may be 
              overcome. Whereas the Law wants to change man's possibilities, the 
              Gospel shows him that God's love remains free and unconditioned, 
              even if man holds on to the concept of conditional love and righteousness 
              by work (and according to that criterion should have lost the sense 
              of his existence). 
            <p>The functional distinction of these two Divine words guarantees 
              that the final value of human existence is not determined by the 
              realisation of conditional as well as free love. According to the 
              Gospel, the value of existence is protected in the sacred realm 
              where it remains taboo. Law then properly serves as stimulation 
              to a perfection that is irrelevant for eschatology. Thus the essential 
              discrimination between Law and Gospel is that one shows human creative 
              abilities and the other Divine reality. 
            <p>If Law challenges the general human ability of love, yet at the 
              same time the universally valid Gospel is free for every culture, 
              it becomes urgent for theology to reckon with the universal research 
              project of discriminating between Law and Gospel. The religions 
              of the world can act as research teams, studying this thesis from 
              various perspectives. However, without a free exchange with mutually 
              examined inter-religious criticism, this inter-religious dialogue 
              and research will be incomplete. In this sense, inter-religious 
              research is a touchstone of universal theology. 
            <p><b>2: The Religion basis of ISKCON</b> 
            <p><i>Preamble<br>
              </i>What is the significance of the contribution of ISKCON to the 
              relationship and formation of both Law and Gospel? ISKCON is not 
              a substantially new religion or a mere product of modern mind detached 
              from the human quest of the utmost truth. ISKCON is a branch of 
              the millenary Krishna religion of Hindu culture in its Bengali form. 
              The Gaudiya Vaishnavas appeal to the Vaishnava Saint, Krishna Caitanya, 
              who is Martin Luther's contemporary. It therefore belongs to the 
              broad <i>bhakti</i> movement in India, which receives an immense 
              impetus in the regions influenced by the Hindu culture today.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#4">4</a> 
            <p>ISKCON is doubtlessly a Hindu denomination-it is ISKCON that uniquely 
              propagates the Hindu culture as a universal and modern form of constructing 
              the world. The particular character of ISKCON is not its religious 
              enthusiasm, but rather that it is the first Hindu missionary movement 
              outside of the Indian subcontinent. Against this background it should 
              be asked how ISKCON may appear in the above mentioned theological 
              perspective. 
            <p><i>Law : the essence of religion is bhakti<br>
              </i>First, the influence and construction of Law in ISKCON needs 
              to be examined. One central question needs to be asked: how does 
              ISKCON understand and confirm service for God and charitable work 
              for our neighbours, is it conditioned or is there a free choice 
              for people? 
            <p>There is no doubt that the development of Law is extremely strong 
              in this religion; it may rightfully be said that this religion represents 
              a highly differentiated judicial piety. The concept used and highly 
              appreciated in Vaishnava religion (and not only by it) is <i>bhakti.Bhakti</i> 
              (service to God) is the highest form of human existence. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami, the founder of the ISKCON mission in the western world, describes 
              this <i>bhakti</i> in a purport of <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> with the 
              words from the eight verses of prayer by Krishna Caitanya as follows, 
              'O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do 
              I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. 
              I only want Your causeless devotional service, birth after birth.'<a

 href="5_2weberfoot.html#5">5</a> 
            <p>Free love, the true way of Law-abiding piety, the true love of 
              God is rather perfectly expressed. <i>Bhakti</i> is pure worship 
              of God; it is not a self-constituent action as it is created by 
              God's mercy. Through the theory of a merciful gift the freedom of 
              God's love is confirmed. <i>Bhakti,</i> free love of God, is the 
              essence of our existence, the unique reason that Krishna Caitanya 
              claims for his existence; it is itself, the only purpose of life. 
              But this <i>bhakti</i> does not deliver man from the circle of reincarnations; 
              in no case is it a means of liberation; it is liberation in itself. 
              It is not from reincarnation that man wants to be liberated, but 
              from non-<i>bhakti</i>, from the senselessness of not realising 
              free love. 
            <p><i> Liturgical ethics: love of God, bhagavata-prema, as puja and 
              liturgy<br>
              </i>ISKCON doubtlessly belongs to the avant-garde of worshipping 
              God in our society. I might guess that this opulent and elaborate 
              religion has decisively pushed forward the ritualistic movement, 
              in that it is on its way to gradually becoming the dominant force 
              in the spiritual movement in Germany, a movement neglected so far 
              by theologians. It is not by accident that the so-called eastern 
              religions play a progressive part. 
            <p>Since the Second Vatican Council, initiated by the hierarchy, the 
              destruction of the Holy Liturgy of the Western church, especially 
              of the ancient Latin Rite, has begun. The abolition of the sacral 
              language was not the only means of the anti-liturgical revolution 
              from above; it was the fundamental liturgical averting from serving 
              God, from the service to God, that was decisive, and the pseudo-liturgical 
              turn to the so-called people of God, serving the congregation which 
              then had become the object of cultivation, according to the proper 
              logic of liturgy.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#6">6</a> Consequently 
              the old altars are abandoned, new tables (without any liturgical 
              logic) have been forced into the churches, the priests turning their 
              backs to the Divine. 
            <p>Liturgy and choirs direct prayers and songs to the people present 
              in the congregations. The pseudo-liturgical revolution of the Second 
              Vatican Council places man in the centre of the so-called liturgical 
              action, and the corresponding tendencies in the sister churches 
              transforming the Holy Communion into a sociable bread and wine supper; 
              this veritable profanation of the Holy Liturgy has continued the 
              anthropologisation of theology, of the science of God, on the level 
              of liturgy and service. 
            <p>When the liquidation of the Holy Liturgy began in the West, at 
              about the same time a seventy-year-old Bengali Vaishnava monk arrived 
              in New York City and immediately began a liturgical counter-offensive, 
              with the construction of temples where the Divine is uniquely worshipped.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#7">7</a> 
              The success of this revival of service is, in my eyes, based on 
              the fact that the traditional western mainstream churches yielded 
              to one-sided social moralism, without noticing the enormous need 
              for an intense immediate worship of God. The liturgical changes 
              of the nineteen-sixties were counter-productive-instead of acknowledging 
              this need for personal worship of God progressively, the traditional 
              service has become even more mutilated. 
            <p><i>Puja</i> is liturgy-service to the Divine and the Holy; it sustains 
              the hagio- or theo-centredness of human existence. ISKCON has reminded 
              us effectively of the necessity and the beauty of dedicating oneself 
              to preserving one's own inner existence and of cultivating it in 
              all conceivable forms. It reminds us of the fact that service to 
              God is the basis of the service to our neighbour. 
            <p>A further contribution of ISKCON in re-establishing a rich culture 
              of serving the Lord, by placing an emphasis on the central importance 
              of glorifying the name of God in the cultural practice and in the 
              theology of worship. According to the general Vaishnava teachings, 
              the chanting of the Holy Name, the <i>nama-sankirtana,</i> is the 
              only possibility in this day and age to sustain the basis of one's 
              spiritual existence. For in this age of <i>kali-yuga,</i> when people 
              cannot surrender to an elaborate form of religion, the chanting 
              of the Holy Name is the direct method to attain perfection in spiritual 
              life (that is <i>bhakti</i> or devotion and <i>bhagavata-prema</i> 
              or love of Godhead)<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#8">8</a> according 
              to Bhaktivedanta Swami, and it is viewed as the sole method: 'Lord 
              Caitanya has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has 
              to chant the holy name of God to attain perfection in spiritual 
              life'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#9">9</a> By emphasising the chanting, 
              ISKCON shows us that the function of Lady Music, who has been placed 
              immediately behind theology by Martin Luther, obviously is not only 
              to offer relaxation to the stressed careerists but above all to 
              prepare the way to love God-to bhakti. Who may believe in the power 
              of the chanted glorification of the name of God in order to awake 
              free love of God, and to one's neighbour, when listening to the 
              church songs today? ISKCON reminds us of the hidden power of hallelujah, 
              of the glorification of the Divine name. 
            <p><i>Pastoral Ethics: guru and confessor<br>
              </i>The religious changes in the Catholic Church produced by the 
              adherents of the Second Vatican Council have reversed the liturgical 
              order and <i>de facto</i> liquidated private confession. Thus the 
              last remains of a millennial spiritual authority, the confessor 
              or spiritual father, the serious individual guide, the critical 
              and committed companion of the spiritual and moral life of a person, 
              disappears. The demand for spiritual advice and guidance has shifted 
              to social work or therapy, caused by the pressures of modern lifestyles. 
              Thus more and more priests consider themselves primarily therapists 
              and social workers, or they escape from their original task as spiritual 
              guides by turning to policy and administration. It is the spiritual 
              guide's business to support the individual according to his own 
              capabilities, and by turning to the faith. For these reasons an 
              immediate reform of our clergy is necessary. Their duty is to guarantee 
              a durable and responsible spiritual guidance that links the two 
              aspects of people's lives - this does not seem to be fulfilled today. 
              It is no wonder that the ancient institution of the personal, often 
              lifelong spiritual teacher, the lama or guru, meets with much sympathy. 
            <p>The institution of a guru is self-evident in many religions and 
              consequently well accepted. Teacher and disciple know what each 
              of them might expect, and the incorporation into the traditional 
              culture secures the effectiveness and reliability of that relationship. 
              There are, however, public scandals again and again with such teachers 
              in India, for example just recently with a Jain-Digamber monk,<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#10">10</a> 
              but this scandal shows us that teachers are not allowed to get away 
              with criminal activities. If they are convicted of illegal behaviour, 
              as a rule they are defeated. In the Hindu-Buddhist tradition gurus 
              are, however, well respected and searched for, without people submitting 
              blindly to the authority of spiritual teachers. 
            <p>It is known that in the west ISKCON gurus misused their authority; 
              this came about however, as a result of the actions and motivations 
              of both the gurus and the diciples. Based on my own observation, 
              I may say that often a disciple's exaggerated wish to surrender, 
              together with the guru's overestimatation of the disciple, sometimes 
              resulted in irregular behaviour. The inadequacies of the guru and 
              the disciples might in most cases be due to a mutual weakness of 
              personalities if there is no criminal intention. The number of western 
              people that leave ISKCON is high in Germany, because many new converts 
              can not adhere to the strict moral regulations of the society. Regardless 
              of these problems in ISKCON's history, there is no doubt that the 
              guru system has a future, especially for the development of a spiritual 
              culture. 
            <p>It is said that the territorial or congregational pastoral system 
              is being made obsolete by the spiritual sensitivity of the modern 
              individual. The local priests are left with the life cycle of stiff 
              and shortened casual exchanges with their congregation. Vivekananda 
              Swami, the Bengal Hindu reformer, has clearly realised this new 
              pastoral situation rather early. He saw the duty of a spiritual 
              father, the guru, to help the disciple discover and cultivate just 
              that kind of religion which corresponds to the disciple's <i>svadharma,</i> 
              not his own. According to him, the mere adoption of generalised 
              standards leads to the destruction of every spirituality.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#11">11</a> 
            <p> The only way that a guru or spiritual father will survive in the 
              long run is if he can adjust to the highly sensitive disciple, and 
              to respond to the singularity of the disciple in a creative way. 
              To my eyes, here the traditional ISKCON guru has reached a limit. 
              His patriarchal self-understanding as well as the transmission of 
              standardised patterns of a generalised religious culture, does not 
              allow the sensitivity that is required today. Nevertheless, the 
              modern guru's free and sensitive practice of caring for the disciples 
              is a lesson especially for modern urban societies. The polemics' 
              attack against the guru's authority is a genuine attempt to obstruct 
              the spiritual way of those people who want and need spiritual advice. 
            <p><i>Ministerial ethics: brahmanas and priests<br>
              </i>ISKCON itself does not present a perfect social counter pattern. 
              It is rather a brahminical society. What is new is that participation 
              in this class organisation is enabled not by birth or child baptism, 
              but by free decision and public initiation. Hence ISKCON is a branch 
              of the neo-brahminical movement in modern Hinduism which decisively 
              rejects Gandhi's physical conception of maintaining the castes.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#12">12</a> 
              ISKCON does not share the conception of physical birth determining 
              man's religious dignity, such as the Sayyids in Islam, the Cohanim 
              and Levites in Jewdaism. It is rather a society of people committed 
              especially to spiritual practice by dedicating their lives to an 
              intense worship of God through <i>puja</i> (offerings made to the 
              Lord) and <i>sankirtana</i> (the congregational chanting of the 
              names of the Lord), and helping other people engaged in worldly 
              affairs by giving them spiritual advice and instructions. 
            <p>Such spiritual communities may be found in all religions: the monk 
              and nun-orders, the Sikh-khalsa, the community of Taizé, and the 
              Sufi-order, are some examples. ISKCON is not self-centred, but altruistically 
              directed to its counterpart, to God or the world. 
            <p>Consider the members that dedicate their lives to devotional service, 
              and intensely care for those working in material jobs. As a rule 
              the priests are only able to do this if they are backed up by a 
              brotherhood, or, if necessary, live together in a community (<i>vita 
              communis</i>). The fact is that more and more Christian communities 
              are founded using this method of operating, living to preach-as 
              they say- and to live their faith. This shows us that ISKCON has 
              been drawn into the pastoral vacuum left by the previous general 
              ecclesiastical culture for the aim of propagating the worship of 
              God. 
            <p>It has been observed, however, that the <i>vita communis</i> is 
              declining more and more in ISKCON and that in its place a community 
              of more independent brahminical families is being established, inevitably 
              pushing forward the pluralisation of ISKCON. 
            <p><i>Inter-religious ethics: the universal glorification of God or 
              ISKCON and other religions<br>
              </i>Let us turn to a further question about the position of ISKCON 
              towards Law. Is it ready and capable of overcoming theological barriers 
              for the increase of God's praise? The Roman Catholic Church has 
              made tremendous changes in the last few decades. On the subject 
              of freedom of religion, the Second Vatican Council announced that 
              every human being and every religious community has the right to 
              freedom of religion, and that Christians have a duty to respect 
              the freedom of their neighbours.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#13">13</a> 
            <p>On the occasion of their Ramadan fasting the Holy Father has sent 
              greetings to the Muslims in the world for several years. He does 
              not address them as fundamentalists or cursed followers of a cheat, 
              but as religious brothers and sisters who adore the same God together 
              with the Catholics. The Pope has declared that 'With great respect 
              the Church considers the Muslims who adore the only God, the Living 
              Being existing by Himself, the Merciful and Almighty Creator of 
              heaven and earth who spoke to the people . . .They (also) appreciate 
              a moral attitude of life and worship God by prayers, alms and fasting'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#14">14</a> 
            <p> But Hinduism also endeavours for the sacred. It is said of Hinduism, 
              to which ISKCON is affiliated, that 'In Hinduism, people search 
              for the Divine secret and express it in an infinite number of myths 
              and in profound philosophical attempts and seek liberation from 
              our narrow and restricted condition<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#15">15</a> 
              by living a life of renunciation, or deep meditation or by lovingly 
              taking shelter of God'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#16">16</a> 
            <p>This acceptance of love of God, of <i>bhakti,</i> or other efforts 
              for the sacred made by other religions, is based on the idea of 
              God's truth transgressing the limits of the church. 'Everything 
              that is true and sacred in other religions is not rejected by the 
              Catholic church.' For 'not very rarely they let us see a beam of 
              the truth which enlightens all men'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#17">17</a> 
              Thus the Catholic church no longer denounces and blasphemes the 
              love of God in other religions but tunes them into the choir for 
              the genuine glorification of God. 
            <p>Considering the newly acquired religious openness in Rome the question 
              arises whether ISKCON, with the single aim of worshipping and loving 
              God, is able to acknowledge a multi-religious worshipping of God, 
              or to even support it. We will see whether ISKCON will be able to 
              integrate into their movement all those who want to praise God, 
              or whether it has given up its Hindu character in favour of the 
              older Christian sentence: <i>extra ecclesiam nulla salus</i>! 
            <p>Evidence points ISKCON to the latter direction. In the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              (9.23) it is said: 'Those who are devotees of other gods and who 
              worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunti, 
              but they do so in a wrong way'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#18">18</a> 
              Bhaktivedanta comments on his translation as follows, 'The demigods 
              are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government 
              of the Supreme Lord . . . In other words, Krishna does not approve 
              the unnecessary worship of the demigods'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#19">19</a> 
              In my eyes, Bhaktivedanta Swami has inadmissibly sharpened the sentence 
              from the <i>Bhagavad-gita;</i> for the clue in the sentence is that 
              even wrong worship ultimately reaches Krishna, the true God. 
            <p>In a conversation with P. Emmanuel Jungclaussen, a Benedictine 
              monk of Byzantine rite from Niederalteich, Bhaktivedanta Swami said, 
              '&quot;Christus&quot; is a different way to say &quot;Krishto&quot; 
              and &quot;Krishto&quot; is another way of pronouncing the word &quot;Krishna&quot; 
              the name of God'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#20">20</a> In this statement, 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami makes a distinction between the different types 
              of worship between the other faiths, for now the object of worship 
              is identical and the difference in worship are considered equal. 
              This is similar to the founder of this movement, Bhaktivedanta Swami 
              says when the Pope says, 'Jesus Christ means Jesus, Christ's or 
              Krishna's son. He has called himself Son of God. Therefore, whether 
              they call God &quot;Krishto&quot; or &quot;Krishna&quot; or &quot;Christos&quot;, 
              there is no difference.' <a href="5_2weberfoot.html#21">21</a> 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami declaring Jesus the son of Christus / Krishna 
              is an interesting annotation to Christology but does not impede 
              the basic idea of a positive integration of the Christian worship 
              of God into ISKCON, for he adds, 'There is no difference, Krishna 
              or Christus, there is the name, and, according to the Vedic scriptures, 
              we recommend to chant the name of God in this age'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#22">22</a> 
            <p>Then Bhaktivedanta Swami develops his multi-religious theology 
              of the names comprising many religions, 'We are limited, but God 
              is unlimited, absolute, He has infinite names and energies, and 
              every name is God. We can understand His names as far as our understanding 
              reaches'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#23">23</a> If this is true-that 
              is, if worshipping other names of God means worshipping the unique 
              true God-it begs the question why did Bhaktivedanta Swami come to 
              the West for his mission? The answer is surprising; it is not that 
              worshipping God was wrong here, but that He was not worshipped at 
              all.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#24">24</a> Thus it is the duty of 
              the 'Krishna-conscious movement . . . to teach people to revitalise 
              their forgotten love of God'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#25"> 25</a> 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami does not want to replace an existing religion 
              with a new one, therefore he can claim to revitalise love of God 
              in other religious traditions, ' &quot;Christo&quot; or &quot;Krishna&quot;-there 
              is no difference. Let us co-operate and chant, and if you are prejudiced 
              to chant the name &quot;Krishna&quot;, then chant &quot;Christo&quot; 
              or &quot;Krishto&quot;'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#26">26</a> 
            <p>Obviously Bhaktivedanta Swami is open to other names of God and 
              worshipping them, and to other religions, because the actual practice 
              of glorifying God is the highest aim of religion, not the abolition 
              of one religion to expand another religious organisation, he says: 
            <ul>
              <p>'I think the Christian priests should co-operate with the Krishna 
                consciousness movement. They should chant the name Christ or Christos 
                and should stop condoning the slaughter of animals. This programme 
                follows the teachings of the Bible: it is not my philosophy. You 
                have your Christian teachings, follow them . . . !'<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#27">27</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>The essence of ISKCON is the all-embracing awakening of love of 
              God. Considering the lack of motivation to love God in western societies, 
              this reminder from our Hindu friends for revitalising the first 
              sentence of the Law-of free love of God-is of great benefit to us. 
            <p><i>Social ethics: institutionalised charity as policy and diaconate<br>
              </i>Charity as part of Hindu culture is not well recognised in the 
              west. In general it is believed that charity is not the business 
              of Hindu culture and their religious communities. This belief is 
              doubtlessly a product of colonial self-justification. As in every 
              society, the Indian society has a sophisticated system of political 
              organisation and diaconate help. In this respect, ISKCON is in the 
              Hindu tradition of Vaishnavism. It should also be mentioned that 
              the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> is accepted as a source of religious truth 
              in which the institution of authority, as executor of justice, is 
              theologically founded by God Himself. Thus the politicians have 
              the necessary duty to assert justice even against their own interests, 
              for example by laws of solidarity of the clan and the caste. 
            <p>In his purport to the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (2.32), Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami quotes a sentence from Parashara concerning this topic, 'The 
              kshatriya's duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, 
              and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for 
              law and order'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#28">28</a> If the holder 
              of authority did not fulfil his duty he would go to hell. <a href="5_2weberfoot.html#29">29</a> 
              The reason for Arjuna's proposal not to fight was based on sense 
              gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting 
              because he thought by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would 
              be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins 
              and brothers, the sons of Dhritarashtra'.<a

 href="5_2weberfoot.html#30">30</a> At a closer look, Arjuna's concept of happiness 
              does not appear selfless, 'Happiness derived from conquering them 
              and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis 
              of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and 
              duty'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#31">31</a> The administrator must 
              fulfil his duty, 'Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to 
              prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#32">32</a> 
              That is, the administrative actions ordered by the respective svadharma 
              must not be done or not done as a means for a different end. The 
              Law of justice is to be upheld which is to be enforced in free love 
              among people. 
            <p>This political theory approaches the Lutheran doctrine of authority 
              very closely, when, according to the reformer, the individual conscience 
              must not triumph over the official duty. The office requires free 
              love not bound to interests outside of the general welfare. 
            <p>As to Bhaktivedanta Swami, charity towards one's neighbour is implied 
              in the love of God, when he says that a mystic yogi practising yoga 
              with half-closed eyes strives for any kind of self-interest or some 
              personal satisfaction, but a Krishna conscious person, a devotee 
              is free from every desire of personal satisfaction because his criterion 
              of perfection is the satisfaction of Krishna, that is love of God.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#33">33</a> 
              In this passage, Bhaktivedanta Swami directly connects free love 
              of God with free love of one's neighbour. As free love of God is 
              the final fulfilment of human existence, free love is the only solution 
              for social relationship. What sense should a selfish motivation 
              make? According to Bhaktivedanta Swami <i>dharma</i> (religion), 
              whatever worldly function it may have, can only be properly fulfilled 
              if it is fulfilled in the state of <i>bhakti.</i> Thus, every secular 
              action of <i>dharma</i> becomes an act of serving God. An idea we 
              know clearly from the Reformation. 
            <p>Diaconate is an essential element of ISKCON; it is extensively 
              practised world-wide.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#34">34</a> The foundation 
              of Christiane Rückert's charitable society 'Golden Lotus' in the 
              1980s, has proved the charitable power of ISKCON, and in-between 
              the somewhat normal diaconate work, 'Food for Life', was registered 
              in Germany.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#35">35</a> 
            <p>ISKCON is by no means restricted to the propagation of the first 
              part of the Law; to love one's neighbour as an expression of love 
              of God is rather an integer constituent element of its religious 
              programme. Worldly accomplishment of duty should not be evaded, 
              for, 'Such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one 
              to the path of liberation',<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#36">36</a> 
              that is, to love of God. That is that Bhaktivedanta Swami may say 
              that love of one's neighbour is the basis of the existence of genuine 
              love of God, and that not only a mere monastic application may bring 
              it about. 
            <p>If we confirm a clear theological connection of accomplishing worldly 
              duties and spiritual love of God, it seems that due to circumstances, 
              the strength of ISKCON is mainly shown in the re-cultivation of 
              love of God. 
            <p><i>Gospel<br>
              </i>From the perspective of a Protestant theology of a traditional 
              origin, the most relevant question is, whether a difference can 
              be found between Law and Gospel in the theology of ISKCON. Our question 
              is whether the ISKCON religion realises that the sacred exists before 
              and independent of every work, even of free love, and turns to people 
              in free love. 
            <p>To a large extent, ISKCON has developed the Law. This cannot be 
              denied. To describe its evangelical aspect, however, a more profound 
              inter-theological hermeneutic is required. 
            <p> The main reason for the unwillingness to co-operate on an inter-theological 
              level, is not only the fault of the dialectic theology but also 
              of the anti-Lutheran understanding of the science of interpreting 
              the Bible, which today is mostly understood as that which Luther 
              considered as settled: as a better Law. Consequently Law differing 
              from Gospel cannot be found in other religions because it is no 
              longer known in one's own religion. 
            <p>Nevertheless I would like to make an attempt to identify evangelical 
              aspects in ISKCON. In ISKCON texts, it is said again and again that 
              God turns to those persons who practise <i>bhakti,</i> and that 
              love of God is the condition for God's love to a human being. Or, 
              in other words, that God has implanted the possibility of free love 
              in man who does not realise it. 
            <p>In my eyes, this view of the relationship between God and man is 
              widespread, reflecting a generally moral attitude in modern society, 
              which is also shared by the religious culture of ISKCON. 
            <p>ISKCON theology, however, transmits an alternative conception which 
              is found in the basic document of the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the above 
              mentioned 'eight stanzas' of Krishna Caitanya. There He demonstrates 
              his trust in Krishna being and remaining His Lord even if He, Krishna 
              Caitanya, cannot feel 'ecstatic love' and has fallen 'into the ocean 
              of birth and death'; that is, He has not realised free love of God, 
              <i>bhakti,</i> but is obsessed by selfish motives. This confidence 
              of transcending into that quality of faith leading to free love 
              of God is present when Krishna Caitanya confesses His lack of <i>bhakti,</i> 
              'I am so unfortunate that I have no attraction for Your name', although 
              Krishna reveals His name in various ways, fills them with all His 
              shakti, and does not give prescriptions how to worship His name.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#37">37 
              </a> Having fallen into the ocean of reincarnation, by this He means 
              having become a prey to selfish desires He cannot realise free love 
              of God; <i>bhakti</i> being so easy to attain, I believe Krishna 
              Caitanya draws an evangelical conclusion, 'I am Your eternal servitor, 
              yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. 
              Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of 
              the atoms at Your lotus feet'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#38">38</a> 
            <p> This faith in Krishna's mercy is the utmost horizon of the existence 
              of <i>bhakti</i> freeing itself from the hallucination that the 
              Supreme Reality attaches the sense of human existence to the achievement 
              of Law and righteousness. Through Krishna Caitanya's verses the 
              evangelical logic of Law permeates that man's free love of God is 
              only possible with the presupposition of God's free love, in that 
              God's free love is given to a person regardless of his or her achievements 
              and works. 
            <p>There are hints of an evangelical character as well as in the monistic 
              psychology of the teachings about Krishna. 
            <p>The verse from the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> quoted by Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami receives evangelical value if it is clear that Krishna cannot 
              hate Himself, 'All living entities are minute parts of My energy'.<a href="5_2weberfoot.html#39">39</a> 
              Whereas the living entities feel separated from God due to Maya's 
              energy and believe that they have to win God's love back, the devotees 
              know that they can never be separated from Him, and can never get 
              lost because they belong <i>a priori</i> to Him as any other living 
              entity. If Bhaktivedanta Swami decisively emphasises that God and 
              man are different, that man even may become a demon through attachment, 
              the con-substantialised God's love to man is a real existing fact. 
              Persons aware of this fact are happy, and those who do not know 
              this do not have a different nature. 
            <p>The strongest expression of Gospel may be, in my eyes, <i>prasadam</i> 
              (food offered with Love and devotion to the Lord), distributed unconditionally 
              to all men. These material elements do not require the adherence 
              to a certain religion, a certain moral standard or theological insight. 
              When a farmer with his family from Rajasthan surrounded by a swarm 
              of flies enters the ISKCON Krishna-Balarama temple in Vrindavan 
              and opens his hands for <i>prasadam</i>, he is not asked whether 
              he has fulfilled this Law or that Law, by the priest distributing 
              <i>prasadam.</i> The distributor does not care for the outer appearance 
              of the farmer. The Lord's mercy is distributed to everyone, when 
              they come to offer their respects to the Lord at the temple, regardless 
              of their social position or faith. 
            <p> <b>3: Summary and result</b> 
            <p>A diacritico-theological analysis of ISKCON comes to a conclusion 
              that it does not only know free love as prescribed by Law but places 
              it into the worship of God to a high and exemplary extent and calls 
              it the essence of charitable love. 
            <p>Krishna Caitanya transmits the consequence drawn from the concept 
              of free <i>bhakti,</i> God's free love to man, the Gospel, as an 
              alternative for human existence. This motive has, however, not yet 
              been systematically and theologically developed because of the pressure 
              of modern moralism. 
            <p>Nevertheless, Law and Gospel, as well as their distinction are 
              to be found in the Vaishnava religion of ISKCON, but they are not 
              equally represented there. 
            <p>It can be said with full confidence that ISKCON has made, and continues 
              to make an obvious contribution to the topic of God's love and man's 
              love in both religion and politics, both on a theological and practical 
              level. However, a stronger profile is necessary with that, concerning 
              the theological explanation of the Gospel and the distinction between 
              the two <i>verba Dei</i> (the two words of God) because the cultural 
              and herneutical barrier between the eastern and western way of understanding 
              the two theological issues is self-evident even today; however, 
              these could be overcome with a little effort.
