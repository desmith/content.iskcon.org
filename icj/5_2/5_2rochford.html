            <p>I would like to express my gratitude to the many devotees, both 
              in and outside of ISKCON, who have contributed to my research efforts 
              over the past twenty years. It has been a remarkable journey for 
              me, and one that I remain committed to. 
            <p> <i>The only way that the Supreme Lord can be worshipped is through 
              the functioning system of varnasrama (culture). Because it facilitates, 
              gives the maximum opportunity for success in the practice of sadhana-bhakti. 
              </i>(Prabhupada disciple, November, 1992.) 
            <p><i>We have the absolute truth but we lack a culture to support 
              it.And without culture, we find ourselves facing so many different 
              problems as a society. How to educate our kids? Where to earn a 
              living. How to live peacefully in Krishna Consciousness. So many 
              things. </i>(Prabhupada disciple, May, 1992)   
            <p>The study of culture has been largely neglected by investigators 
              of social movements (Johnston and Klandermans, 1995:20, McAdam, 
              1994:37). This oversight is surprising for a number of reasons. 
              First, social movements represent collective responses to injustices 
              found within mainstream cultures (Gamson et al., 1982; Turner, 1969; 
              Snow et al., 1986). Secondly, social movement organisations are 
              inevitably influenced by the cultures in which they operate (Tarrow, 
              1994; Zalf and Ash, 1996). And thirdly, social movements often represent 
              conscious efforts to create cultural alternatives, perhaps involving 
              the mobilisation of oppositional cultures (Gitlin, 1980; Taylor 
              and Whitte, 1995), or social movement communities (Buechler, 1990).<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#1">1</a> 
            <p> While bringing cultural analysis to the study of social movements 
              represents a promising line of enquiry, the question of how culture 
              should be integrated into the analysis of social movements remains 
              less clear (Johnston and Klandermans, 1995). As the latter authors 
              argue, 'Unless we are able to construct theories that relate to 
              variables we know already to be of influence-such as resources, 
              organisations, political opportunities, and perceived costs and 
              benefits of participation-we will not get beyond the descriptive 
              study of aspects of movement culture' (1995:21). Moreover, the study 
              of movement culture must be tied to issues central to the field, 
              such as how cultural variables influence the rise and decline of 
              social movements and their organisational forms (Johnston and Klandermans, 
              1995:21). The present study attempts to move along these lines by 
              considering the North American development of the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). I will consider the 
              interrelationship between the growth of marriage and family life, 
              changing economic resources, social movement culture, and the processes 
              of decline and transformation within ISKCON and its communities. 
            <p>After first presenting a brief overview of marriage and family 
              life within select American religious communities, and clarifying 
              the methods and procedures used in this research, I will divide 
              the remainder of the paper into four major sections. The first discusses 
              marital and family life as it existed during the first half of ISKCON's 
              North American history. The second section traces the numerical 
              expansion of married and family life within ISKCON during the 1980s 
              and early 1990s. The third details the economic factors and circumstances 
              resulting in the ascendancy of the nuclear family. The final section 
              considers how the nuclear family played an instrumental role in 
              the transformation of ISKCON from a sectarian institution<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              to an inclusive organisation comprised of congregationally-based 
              communities in North America. Here I will argue that the failure 
              to develop cultural institutions to support and accommodate family 
              life precipitated the exodus of large numbers of parents and their 
              children from ISKCON's communities. The paper concludes with a discussion 
              of these changes in light of the teachings of ISKCON's founder, 
              Srila Prabhupada. 
            <p><b>Marriage and family within religious communities<br>
              </b>Marriage and family life have played a central role in the fate 
              of communal societies, be they religious or secular in orientation. 
              Kanter's (1972) investigation of nineteenth century American communes 
              found that marital and family ties often conflicted with a community's 
              need to build and sustain member commitment and loyalty. Only by 
              renouncing couple and family relationships could intimacy become 
              a collective good serving the interests of the community as a whole. 
              As Kanter makes clear, utopian communities-past and present-face 
              the delicate task of building relational structures 'which do not 
              compete with the community for emotional fulfilment' (197:91). To 
              do otherwise is to put the communal enterprise at risk (also, see 
              Coser, 1974:136-49; Zablocki, 1980:146-88). 
            <p>Yet previous research has demonstrated that religious communities, 
              especially those favouring a more disciplined, sectarian way of 
              life, fare much better than their more secular counterparts (Berger, 
              1981:129; Foster, 1991; Hall, 1988; Kanter, 1972; Zablocki, 1971). 
              Two of the most successful American religious societies, the Shakers 
              and Oneida, each eschewed the nuclear family, although for somewhat 
              different reasons and by means that represented opposite extremes 
              (Foster, 1991). Under the leadership of Mother Ann Lee the Shakers 
              practised strict celibacy. Celibacy allowed women to escape the 
              domestic demands of child-rearing, thus freeing them to devote their 
              full-time energies to the needs of the Shaker community. It also 
              afforded women the possibility of greater equality with Shaker men 
              (Foster, 1991:31). By contrast, the Oneida community founded by 
              John Humphrey Noyes favoured group marriage or what came to be called 
              'complex marriage'. As the <i>Handbook of the Oneida Community</i> 
              noted, in 1875, 'Two people should not &quot;worship and idolise 
              each other..The heart should be free to love all the true and worthy, 
              [without] selfish love&quot;' (in Carden, 1969:49). 
            <p>Other sectarian groups devised still other ways to control marital 
              relations. The early Mormon practice of polygamy simultaneously 
              limited exclusive ties between marriage partners while creating 
              an elaborate network of interconnected kinship ties that served 
              the interests of group solidarity (Foster, 1991:205). The Amana 
              communities reduced an individual's spiritual status and community 
              ranking following marriage (Barthel, 1984:55). The marriage ceremony 
              itself included a text which read, 'To be married is good, but to 
              be unmarried is better' (Kanter, 1972:8). 
            <p>With respect to family life, successful intentional communities 
              of the past restricted involvement and emotional attachments between 
              parent and child (Kanter, 1972:90). Children were viewed as communal 
              property, and child rearing became the responsibility of the community 
              as a whole, instead of the biological parents. At Oneida, for example, 
              young children were separated from their parents and placed in the 
              communal 'Children's House'. Until the age of twelve they attended 
              school, worked part-time, and received religious training. Parents 
              had only limited involvement in the day-to-day lives of their children 
              and were subject to group sanction for becoming emotionally attached 
              (Carden, 1969:64-5). 
            <p>Although we know that marriage and family life play a role in the 
              fate of communal societies, we know much less empirically and theoretically 
              about the circumstances under which they gain or perhaps lose control 
              over these exclusive relationships. Below, I trace the North American 
              history of marital and familial relationships within ISKCON, demonstrating 
              how changes in the structure of the family during the 1980s initiated 
              a process of internal secularisation-defined by outward expanding 
              congregationalism and accompanying decommunisation. My description 
              and analysis emphasises how cycles of economic growth and decline 
              influenced ISKCON's ability to control family relations. Lacking 
              the resources to develop and sustain a religious culture to accommodate 
              family life, ISKCON became a congregational movement in North America 
              by the end of the 1980's. 
            <p><b>Methods and data collation<br>
              </b>Data for this paper was collected over the course of twenty 
              years of research on ISKCON in the USA and Canada (see, Rochford, 
              1985). During that time I have visited and conducted research in 
              virtually every major ISKCON community in the United States. (For 
              a more detailed account of these methods see Rochford, 1985:21-42, 
              1992a.). The present paper is an outgrowth of my ongoing investigation 
              into ISKCON's development over the past decade, especially as it 
              relates to family life (Rochford 1995a, 1995b) and the fate of ISKCON's 
              second generation (Rochford 1992b, 1994a, 1996). 
            <p>Over the course of my research, I have combined participant observation, 
              interviewing, and the collection of survey data. I have also made 
              use of ISKCON publications as a source of historical data, especially 
              the published letters of ISKCON's founder (see Prabhupada, 1992). 
              My field research was conducted during two separate periods, 1975-1981, 
              and 1990-1994. In 1990, I formally interviewed over 70 first generation 
              parents affiliated with four ISKCON communities in the US. Since 
              then, I have also interviewed more than a dozen ISKCON teachers, 
              several ISKCON leaders and dozens of second generation devotees. 
              Since 1991, I have served as a member of ISKCON's North American 
              Board of Education. 
            <p>This investigation presents findings from two non-random surveys. 
              The first survey was conducted, in 1980, with data collected from 
              a total of 314 adult devotees residing in six major ISKCON communities 
              in the US such as Los Angeles, New York and Boston. The survey focused 
              primarily on questions of recruitment and the range of factors that 
              influenced member commitment and conversion. It is used here as 
              a comparative baseline to help track changing patterns of marriage, 
              employment and family life within ISKCON during the 1980s. 
            <p>The second survey was conducted during the autumn of 1991, and 
              early winter 1992, with a total of 268 respondents. The survey targeted 
              first generation devotees affiliated with nine ISKCON communities 
              in the US. In the end, however, a total of nineteen devotee communities 
              in the US and three in Canada were represented as questionnaires 
              were distributed widely by ISKCON members. The questionnaire focused 
              primarily on family issues, questions relating to children and education, 
              and the organisational and religious commitments of ISKCON members. 
              Questionnaire respondents included core-ISKCON members, congregational 
              members, and former ISKCON adherents. Findings reported in the present 
              study are limited to core-members and congregational members (N=234). 
            <p><b>Marriage, family and social control during ISKCON's early years<br>
              </b>Until the early 1980s, ISKCON exercised considerable control 
              over the lives of its membership.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#3">3</a> 
              To practise Krishna Consciousness and be an ISKCON member required 
              cutting ties with the outside secular culture and living a disciplined, 
              communal way of life (Rochford, 1985). Despite the personal sacrifices 
              involved, devotees willingly committed themselves to the requirements 
              set forth by their guru, Srila Prabhupada. Perhaps in no other way 
              was this more evident than in the realm of marriage and family life. 
            <p><i>Sexual Politics and Marriage<br>
              </i>When Prabhupada attracted his first followers from among the 
              hippies on the Lower East side of New York City, in 1965 and 1966, 
              he was surprised when a number of young women expressed interest 
              in becoming involved in his spiritual movement. Within the first 
              year he initiated his first female disciple (S. Goswami, 1980:184) 
              By the time of his death, in 1977, Prabhupada initiated as many 
              as two thousand other women into his Krishna Consciousness movement. 
            <p>From the very beginning the question arose as to how to deal with 
              the presence of both unmarried men and women within ISKCON. The 
              spiritual ideal was for single men and women to be strictly segregated 
              with little or no contact between them. However, Prabhupada realised 
              that this was a difficult proposition in America where 'boys and 
              girls are accustomed to mix[ing] freely with one another' (Prabhupada, 
              1992:865). The problem intensified, in 1967, when ISKCON opened 
              a temple in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. Having 
              attracted 150-200 recruits during its first two years in Haight-Ashbury, 
              ISKCON's communal structure emerged in order to hold onto the many 
              young hippies who were otherwise without stable or permanent residence 
              in the local area (Rochford,1985:158-59). 
            <p>In 1967, one of Prabhupada's first women disciples raised the possibility 
              of creating a separate women's <i>asrama</i> to house the growing 
              number of unmarried women joining the movement. In his response 
              to her, Prabhupada pointed to the inherent dangers of allowing men 
              and women to freely associate with one another. 
            <ul>
              <p>In the scriptures it is said that the woman is just like fire 
                and the man is like a butter pot. The butter melts in the pot 
                while in contact with the fire ... In spiritual life attraction 
                of man and woman ... hampers very much, therefore some sort of 
                restrictions are necessary to check this hampering problem (Prabhupada,1992: 
                851). 
            </ul>
            <p>Creating separate living quarters for men and women provided one 
              barrier to male-female interaction. Yet this proved only to be only 
              a partial solution since men and women still remained housed within 
              the temple complex, within close proximity of one another during 
              the day. On those occasions where men and women found it necessary 
              to interact these exchanges were formal and ritualistically structured. 
              A male devotee was required to address a women as 'mother', and 
              a women devotee was expected to treat a man as if he were her son. 
            <p>Limiting contact between members of the opposite sex often required 
              rather extreme strategies of avoidance. Consider the account of 
              one woman who reminisced about her early days as a devotee in the 
              early 1970s. The occasion was a meeting of ISKCON's North American 
              Board of Education.

              <p><b>W:</b> I remember when I lived in Boston I had to try and 
                avoid all association from all the men . . . Just one simple example. 
                I wasn't allowed, <i>ever</i>, to look up from the floor if there 
                was a man around. (Laughter). In fact we [women] lived on the 
                fourth floor. If there was a man going up the stairs and I was 
                going down, I had to go all the way back up to the fourth floor. 
                I couldn't be anywhere near the stairs if there was a man on the 
                stairs. And if a man walked near me, I'd put my face in a corner 
                until they walked past. I'd face the wall and go like this (covering 
                her face with her <i>sari</i>), in the corner (laughter).<br>
                <b>Man:</b> Having lived as a <i>brahmacari</i> in the same temple 
                at that time I would say you're not at all exaggerating. <br>
                <b>W:</b> Yes you were there at that time. I'm not exaggerating.

            <p>&nbsp;Given that the movement's membership was comprised of young 
              people in their late-teens and early-twenties, a life of celibacy 
              represented a difficult goal for many. Prabhupada recognised that 
              many of his male disciples would be unable to live the celibate 
              life of a <i>brahmacari.</i> During his first year in America, Prabhupada 
              received the first of what would prove to be many requests for permission 
              to marry. While reminding his disciples that married life and the 
              entanglements thereof made it 'difficult to make any progress in 
              Krsna Consciousness' (Prabhupada, 1992:852), he nevertheless allowed 
              marriage between his disciples. As he told one of his young male 
              disciples, in 1969: 
            <ul>
              <p>So far as your occasionally getting agitation from <i>maya,</i> 
                the answer is simple; one must either strictly control the senses, 
                or else he must get himself married. If one is strong enough in 
                Krsna Consciousness, then there is no reason to become <i>grihastha</i> 
                [householder], but if one is still disturbed by sex desire, then 
                marriage is the only other possibility (Prabhupada, 1992:857). 
            </ul>
            <p>Quite apart from the fact that some of his male disciples proved 
              incapable of subduing their sexual urges in <i>brahmacari</i> life, 
              the presence of a substantial number of women made the expansion 
              of family life inevitable. As Prabhupada explained in a 1975 letter 
              to one of his disciples: 
            <ul>
              <p>Of course, it is better to remain unmarried, celibate. But so 
                many women are coming, we cannot reject them. If someone comes 
                to Krsna it is our duty to give them protection . So the problem 
                is there, the women must have a husband to give protection (Prabhupada 
                1992:869). 
            </ul>
            <p>In accordance with Vedic scripture, Prabhupada recognised that 
              for his women disciples marriage and family life represented the 
              basis of their spiritual and material fulfilment. Unlike men, for 
              whom celibate <i>brahmacari</i> life represented the spiritual ideal, 
              it was thought that 'their natural propensity' was to 'desire good 
              husbands, a good home, [and] children' (Prabhupada, 1992:854). 
            <p>In many respects, marriage represented two very different social 
              realities for men and women within ISKCON. For women, marriage was 
              seen as an aid to their spiritual progress in Krishna Consciousness. 
              By contrast, for men, marriage represented a sign of weakness and 
              'spiritual fall-down'. Only men incapable of controlling their senses 
              found reason to marry. If a male devotee was committed to going 
              back to Godhead he remained celibate, dedicating his life to spiritual 
              activities. Because of the widespread acceptance of this philosophy, 
              marriage involved loss of status- spiritually and socially-for men, 
              while having the opposite effect for women. 
            <p>In most cases ISKCON marriages were arranged. Often this meant 
              that devotees entering into marriage had only a minimum amount of 
              contact with their spouse prior to the marriage ceremony. The responsibility 
              for locating suitable marriage partners fell generally on Temple 
              Presidents and other ISKCON authorities.<a

 href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#5">5</a> Frequently these decisions were guided more 
              by community needs and economic considerations than concerns for 
              marital compatibility. For example, if a man or woman raised significant 
              sums of money doing <i>sankirtana</i>,<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#6">6</a> 
              a marriage partner would be chosen with an eye towards causing minimal 
              disruption to his or her's financially lucrative 'service'. A Temple 
              President might have even refused to arrange a marriage for a woman 
              successful at <i>sankirtana</i>, especially if this meant she would 
              be required to relocate to be with her husband. Whatever else went 
              into arranged marriages, questions of romantic love were not a consideration. 
            <p>Although the Vedic literature provides a somewhat different message, 
              Prabhupada taught that householders could gain spiritual-realisation 
              in their present lifetime. After all, he himself had been a family 
              man for much of his life. Moreover, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, the father 
              of his own spiritual master, preached that in the present age, Krishna 
              Consciousness was best cultivated in the role of a householder (Prabhupada, 
              1992:861). Prabhupada considered householders celibate if they limited 
              their sexual activity to begetting Krishna-conscious children and, 
              only then, if they adhered to strict rules regulating sexual intercourse. 
              Sex was permitted each month only when the women was most fertile. 
              Sexual relations could only take place after both husband and wife 
              chanted 50 rounds of the Hare Krishna mantra on their beads, a process 
              taking six or more hours. To use sex to serve Krishna and the spiritual 
              master was a sacred act; to have sexual relations for purposes of 
              gratifying the senses was sinful. As Prabhupada explained in a 1976 
              lecture: 
            <ul>
              <p>In this way you will find, according to [the] Vedic system, [that] 
                sex life is practically denied. But because we are now in the 
                conditioned state, it is very difficult to completely deny sex 
                life. There is [the] regulative principle.no sex life. If you 
                can remain without sex life, <i>brahmacari,</i> it is very good. 
                But if you cannot, then get yourself married, live with wife, 
                but have sex only for progeny. Not for sense enjoyment. Therefore 
                even [if] one is married, if he's sticking to one wife and wife 
                sticking to one man, this is real married life, then the husband 
                is also call <i>brahmacari.</i> Even though he is <i>grihasta.</i> 
                And wife is called chaste (in Devi Dasi, 1992:6). 
            </ul>
            <p>Given the prevailing understanding of marriage, and the controls 
              placed on married life, there was little basis for 'dyadic withdrawal' 
              (Slater, 1963) by married ISKCON members. This was all the more 
              true given that male and female householders alike were engaged 
              in full-time <i>sankirtana,</i> or some other work within the ISKCON 
              community. If anything, it appears that householders were more willing 
              to put their marriages at risk rather than fail to meet their obligations 
              to Prabhupada and his movement. As one Temple President recounted: 
            <ul>
              <p>It was a hard-core pressure. I know one of the primary reasons 
                I'm not married anymore is because I was a Temple President. And 
                it was expected of me that I would give everything I had. There 
                was no question of vacation. There was no question of taking time 
                off for myself. No question. I can give you an example. We had 
                an apartment down here [in the community). We put a bakery in 
                the front because we had a cooking business. It was a duplex. 
                So the apartment in the back, it had absolutely no water power 
                80 percent of the time. At any time, all your water would go off. 
                So no one wanted to live in the apartment, obviously. So I moved 
                my wife and two young children into this apartment. With no water 
                power! You know, my wife's there washing her hair. The water shuts 
                off. I'm not around of course...This is what happened. These were 
                the sacrifices. She finally got to the point where she said, 'That's 
                it. You quit as Temple President and get a job and you take care 
                of me and the family, or that's it'. And so then I was forced 
                to make a choice.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#7">7</a> (Interview 
                1990) 
            </ul>
            <p><i>Children and Family Life <br>
              </i>In 1968, only two years after founding his movement, Prabhupada 
              began to lay plans for establishing a Krishna-conscious school (<i>gurukula</i>). 
              Because Prabhupada saw the school system in America as doing little 
              more than indoctrinating 'children in sense gratification and mental 
              speculation, he called the schools &quot;slaughterhouses&quot;' 
              (J. Goswami, 1984:1). The ultimate goal of the <i>gurukula</i> would 
              be to train students in spiritual life so that they could escape 
              the cycle of birth and death. While academic subjects would be taught 
              in the <i>gurukula</i> its primary purpose was to teach children 
              sense control and practices of renunciation. 
            <ul>
              <p>The students are taught to use their senses in Krsna's service. 
                They learn that their senses are meant not for personal enjoyment, 
                but for Krsna's enjoyment-their enjoyment will come from pleasing 
                Krsna. By learning to engage their senses in the service of the 
                Lord, the students experience the highest standard of happiness 
                (J. Goswami, 1984:2). 
              <p>By being obedient and self-controlled, a young devotee could 
                act on behalf of his or her guru. In this way one's life could 
                become successful (J. Goswami 1984:34-37). 
            </ul>
            <p>Because the primary goal of the <i>gurukula</i> was to provide 
              training in sense control, the movement chose to remove children 
              from the care of their parents at the age of four or five. Given 
              the naturally strong ties between parent and child, Prabhupada recognised 
              that there was little hope for a child to learn self-control within 
              the family context. As one parent and former teacher explained: 
              'It's understood that the parent is lenient and easily influenced 
              by the child because of the ropes of affection. So this is why it 
              is best if a <i>gurukula</i> teacher is instructing them' (interview 
              1990). 
            <p>Children attended the <i>gurukula</i> on a year-round basis, with 
              occasional vacations to visit with parents. They resided in an <i>asrama</i> 
              with 6-8 other children of similar age and same sex. An adult teacher 
              lived in the <i>asrama</i> supervising the children and tending 
              to their daily care. (For a more detailed description of the <i>gurukula</i> 
              see, J. Goswami, 1984, and Rochford, 1992b). 
            <p> Although all ISKCON children were expected to attend the <i>gurukula</i> 
              at least until the age of fifteen, some parents resisted. When this 
              happened parents were subject to both formal and informal sanctions 
              to conform. In some cases ISKCON members faced expulsion from the 
              community for failing to send their child to the <i>gurukula.</i> 
              As one long-time teacher recounted, 'I remember in New York the 
              Temple President told one women, &quot;You don't send your kid to 
              the <i>gurukula</i> you don't live in the temple&quot;' (interview 
              1990). In other cases sanctions were less severe but the pressure 
              to send a child to the <i>gurukula</i> remained, nevertheless. As 
              one devotee woman who removed her child from the <i>gurukula,</i> 
              in 1982, commented: 
            <ul>
              <p>We did try the <i>asrama</i> for a week but she was very upset 
                and unhappy. So you see that and think, you want your child to 
                be happy. And even though there were various devotees around us 
                saying this and that. Because I am a social person I was worried 
                about what everyone was thinking. And even my spiritual master 
                was saying, giving hints, 'Why isn't she here (in the <i>gurukula</i>)?' 
                . And believe me, it would've been easier just to send my child 
                out to the <i>gurukula</i>. Much easier. But intuitively, I just 
                thought it's not right. I just can't do that (interview 1990). 
            </ul>
            <p>Other parents who wanted their children to live at home and attend 
              the <i>gurukula</i> met with similar resistance. As ISKCON's longest 
              serving male teacher recounted, Prabhupada rejected this idea when 
              it was proposed to him in 1975. 
            <ul>
              <p>Prabhupada made this point strongly, even though we forget. <i>Gurukula</i> 
                means residing. Jagadisa [ISKCON's Minister of Education] asked 
                him: 'What if a parent wants to keep a child outside and bring 
                them just during the day?' Prabhupada said: 'I've already told 
                you. <i>Gurukula</i> means residing. We have room for children, 
                not for parents.' (Interview 1991). 
            </ul>
            <p>Another explicit purpose and function of the <i>gurukula</i> was 
              to free parents from the responsibilities of child rearing. With 
              their children in the <i>gurukula,</i> ISKCON authorities required 
              parents to commit their full-time energies to the needs of the movement. 
              In the words of one Prabhupada disciple and parent: 
            <ul>
              <p>Of course one of the main things that Prabhupada wanted to achieve 
                was to free the parents from the encumbrance of the children. 
                Because without children, and that responsibility, parents would 
                be able to do more book selling and more preaching, and to devote 
                full-time to institutional engagements (interview 1990). 
            </ul>
            <p> Under the traditional <i>asrama</i>-based <i>gurukula</i> system, 
              family life was effectively controlled by ISKCON. For all intents 
              and purposes, children and parents lived separate lives. Being free 
              from day-to-day family obligations parents devoted their full-time 
              energies toward furthering the success of Prabhupada's movement. 
            <p><b>The growth of the <i>grihasta</i> <i>asrama<br>
              </i></b>Perhaps no development in ISKCON's North American history 
              has been more striking and consequential than the expansion of married 
              and family life. ISKCON's early years were defined by the <i>brahmacari</i> 
              and <i>brahmacarini asramas</i>, with the majority of its members 
              being single renunciates. Slowly at first, and then with some pace, 
              the number of marriages began to swell. In time, so too did the 
              number of children. 
            <p>As the data in Table 1 indicates, by 1980, ISKCON had about an 
              equal proportion of unmarried renunciates and householders (<i>grihasthas</i>). 
              Only about one-quarter of those surveyed had children. Conversely, 
              by 1991-92 there was a sizeable increase in the percentage of married, 
              or previously married, ISKCON devotees. Two-thirds of those surveyed 
              were married. In addition, one in five were divorced, separated 
              or widowed. Only 15% had never been married. Family life also expanded, 
              with a substantial majority of those surveyed having one or more 
              children.

            <p> (a) The 1980 questionnaire had no category for 'divorced and remarried.' 
              ISKCON members with this marital status would have indicated 'married'. 
              It is unlikely that more than a small percentage of respondents 
              fell into this category given the relative youth of ISKCON's membership, 
              and the movement itself, in 1980. 
            <p>As these findings indicate clearly, by the onset of the 1990s, 
              ISKCON had become a householder's movement in North America.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#8"> 
              8</a> Very few of its long-time male members had managed to realise 
              the spiritual ideal of remaining celibate monks. Moreover, ISKCON 
              had achieved little success attracting young unmarried recruits 
              to its ranks during the 1980s.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#9">9</a> 
            <p> The expansion of the <i>grihastha asrama</i> occurred during a 
              period when ISKCON's communities were facing deepening economic 
              decline and instability. This combination of events provided the 
              impetus for the growth and ultimate ascendancy of the nuclear family 
              as the basis of ISKCON's social organisation in North America. 
            <p><b>Economic adaptation, the ascendancy of the nuclear family and 
              declining organisational control<br>
              </b> Two interrelated changes took place during the early and mid-1980s 
              which contributed to the emergence of the nuclear family, and householders 
              growing independence from ISKCON: (1) The dramatic downturn in ISKCON's 
              economic fortunes which forced most ISKCON householders to secure 
              employment outside the movement's communities; and, (2) The collapse 
              of ISKCON's traditional <i>asrama</i>-based <i>gurukula</i> system, 
              leaving parents responsible for raising their children. 
            <p><i> Economic change and shifting patterns of employment<br>
              </i>Until the early to mid-1980s, ISKCON's communities in North 
              America were supported financially by the practice of <i>sankirtana.</i> 
              As <i>sankirtana</i> revenues began to decline, however, the occupational 
              structure of ISKCON changed dramatically. With few moneymaking opportunities 
              available within the movement, most householders found themselves 
              working jobs within the conventional society. 
            <p> During the late 1960s and early 1970s ISKCON's communities were 
              supported financially from donations received by devotees distributing 
              incense and the movement's <i>Back to Godhead</i> magazine on the 
              streets of America's cities (Rochford, 1985:173). The economics 
              of <i>sankirtana</i> changed dramatically in 1971, and 1972, however, 
              as ISKCON members began distributing Prabhupada's commentaries on 
              the Vedic literatures in public locations, first in parking lots 
              and shopping malls, and then in major American airports. Book distribution 
              expanded yearly through 1976 and provided large sums of money to 
              help finance ISKCON's worldwide expansion. One conservative estimate 
              is that ISKCON's communities in North America grossed over $13 million 
              between 1974 and 1978 on hardback books alone (see Rochford, 1985:171-189). 
            <p>By 1980, ISKCON's book distribution had declined to less than one-quarter 
              of its North American peak (Rochford, 1985:175). The corresponding 
              loss of <i>sankirtana</i> revenues had a devastating effect on ISKCON's 
              communities. Although ISKCON's leaders undertook a number of alternative 
              strategies to forestall the movement's economic demise (by selling 
              record albums, artwork, candles, and food, in public locations for 
              example,) these proved successful only in the short run, and were 
              highly controversial both in and outside of ISKCON (Rochford, 1985:191-11; 
              1988). 
            <p> With declining financial resources available to its communities, 
              ISKCON faced a significant turning point in its North American history. 
              No longer able to maintain financially its communal lifestyle through 
              literature distribution and other forms of public solicitation, 
              and without alternative means of economic support, ISKCON's members 
              had little choice but to seek outside employment.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#10">10 
              </a> Given the relatively high cost associated with supporting families, 
              most householders found themselves searching for sources of income 
              from outside. As one long-time member of ISKCON explained: 
            <ul>
              <p>What happened is that people got married and they just always 
                assumed they would go on living in the temple. I mean I did. We 
                were married in 77. So we thought like that. Life was gonna go 
                on as it always had. It would be a little different. Not much. 
                So eventually a lot of people got married and hung onto temples 
                and that got very expensive to maintain. Suddenly householders 
                wanted to retire from book distribution. They wanted a job in 
                the temple. Yet you can only employ so many people in that way. 
                In the end, we had temples overloaded with expensive householders. 
                The <i>brahmacaris</i> began to say 'Hey. Why should I collect 
                [money on <i>sankirtana</i> ] to support them?' (Interview 1990). 
            </ul>
            <p>As indicated in Table 2, there was a major shift in the occupational 
              structure of ISKCON between 1980 and 1991-92.

            <p>In 1980 nearly all of ISKCON's members worked in movement-owned 
              businesses or within their local devotee community. One-fourth worked 
              as <i> sankirtana</i> devotees. Almost none were self-employed or 
              worked in non-devotee work settings. Also noteworthy is that all 
              ISKCON members surveyed in 1980 worked in some capacity. This reflected 
              the fact that devotees maintained by the temple were obligated to 
              perform community service during this period. Being unmarried and/or 
              free of family obligations, they were also available for work (see 
              Rochford 1995a). 
            <p> By 1992, ISKCON's pattern of employment was strikingly different 
              from its 1980 profile. Just over one-third of those surveyed worked 
              outside ISKCON in a non-devotee business, or were self-employed.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#11">11</a> 
              Somewhat more were employed in work settings with other devotees 
              (that is in an ISKCON business, within an ISKCON community, or in 
              a devotee-owned business. One-fourth were not gainfully employed 
              at the time of the survey. Nearly all of the latter were women with 
              family responsibilities, the majority (72%) of whom did regular 
              volunteer work in their local ISKCON community. 
            <p><i>The demise of the asrama-based gurukula<br>
              </i>The downward turn in ISKCON's economic fortunes had a number 
              of direct and indirect effects on the demise of the movement's traditional 
              <i>gurukula</i> system. 
            <p>By 1986, ISKCON's two remaining <i>gurukula</i> projects in central 
              California and upstate New York closed. Since both were subsidised 
              by ISKCON's North American Governing Body Commission (GBC), and 
              by communities sending students to the schools, ISKCON's eroding 
              economic-base directly contributed to their demise. As a former 
              <i>asrama</i> teacher in ISKCON's central California <i>gurukula</i> 
              recounted: 
            <ul>
              <p> I remember while we were still in Three Rivers, they would give 
                out fifteen dollars a week to the devotees teaching there, for 
                expense. We didn't have to pay for our maintenance, where we lived. 
                We'd get $15 in addition. That had to take care of all the gas, 
                things you needed to get in town. Usually we didn't need too much 
                extra. But there were telephone bills, which were pretty costly 
                if you had to make a toll call. And then when you got your break 
                time [for school vacations] to go down to San Diego to visit friends 
                or relatives, everything had to come out of that $15 a week. And 
                somehow or other we'd always put $5 aside, or $10. But then there 
                came a time when they [authorities running the school] couldn't 
                even give the $15 a week. And then it was like, 'What do you do?'. 
                You didn't even have gas to get into town. It got to the point 
                where it was impossible. 
            </ul>
            <p> But beyond questions of dwindling financial support was a more 
              fundamental issue. As long as householders were going out on <i>sankirtana</i> 
              the <i>asrama</i>-based <i>gurukula</i> was a practical necessity 
              for ISKCON. But as <i>sankirtana</i> revenues fell, and as householders 
              were forced into the outside labour market, the economic incentives 
              associated with the traditional <i>gurukula</i> system no longer 
              existed. As one ISKCON teacher who witnessed the demise of the <i>asrama-gurukula</i> 
              system put it: 
            <ul>
              <p>Also their [the leadership's] main motive, which was to free 
                up parents, didn't exist anymore. There's no <i>sankirtana.</i> 
                The parents are all out there working [in the conventional society].Why 
                should the GBC and the leadership put money and time and manpower 
                into something which they see as having no direct value to the 
                organisation? None. The parents are living outside, doing something 
                outside. If the school closes, parents will just end up teaching 
                their kids at home, or sending them to <i>karmi</i> [non-ISKCON] 
                schools. 
            </ul>
            <p>There were other factors which also contributed to the demise of 
              the <i>gurukula</i> in North America that should be noted. From 
              the beginning, the <i>gurukula</i> suffered from a lack of experienced 
              teachers and support staff. Rather than seeking qualified and interested 
              devotees to educate the movement's children, other criteria were 
              often more important. It was not uncommon, for example, for devotees 
              unsuccessful at <i>sankirtana</i> to be assigned to work in the 
              <i>gurukula</i> (V. dasa 1994:11). This had two consequences for 
              the survival of the <i>gurukula</i> system. 
            <p>First, over time a growing number of parents began to realise that 
              the <i>gurukula</i> was not providing the quality of academic education 
              they wanted for their children. On that basis, some decided to place 
              their children in non-ISKCON schools, or to school them at home.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#12">12</a> 
              A second factor was the growing realisation that some of the movement's 
              children had suffered abuse, including sexual abuse, in the <i>gurukula</i> 
              (McLellan, 1993; M. dasa, 1992a; ISKCON Youth Veterans 1992; Personal 
              interviews 1990-3). Many parents who had not already removed their 
              children from the <i>gurukula</i> did so after they became aware 
              of the allegations of abuse. Finally, by the mid-1980s, it had become 
              apparent that many of ISKCON's teenagers had abandoned any idea 
              of committing their lives to ISKCON. Because of this, some of the 
              leaders began to openly question the need for <i>gurukula</i> altogether 
              (Rochford, 1992b). 
            <p> As a result of these developments, ISKCON's system of education 
              was more or less transformed by the end of the 1980s. Only three 
              <i>asrama</i>-based schools remained in North America, in 1994. 
              Two, for high school aged men and women, are located in ISKCON's 
              Florida community. The other, situated in Baltimore, Maryland, serves 
              the educational needs of half a dozen elementary aged boys. Altogether 
              only about 40 elementary and high school aged students currently 
              attend <i>asrama</i>-based <i> gurukulas.</i> 
            <p>ISKCON's educational system in North America is now comprised largely 
              of day-schools. In 1994 there were nine ISKCON day-schools operating 
              in the USA and Canada. Many of them face ongoing economic problems 
              which threaten their survival (Rochford, 1992b). Two closed in 1992, 
              and 1993, because of falling enrolment and related financial troubles 
              (that is ISKCON's farm community near Port Royal, Pennsylvania, 
              and San Diego). A third school, in a splinter devotee community 
              in central California, closed, in 1993, for the same reasons. 
            <p>The majority of ISKCON's children in North America attend non-ISKCON 
              schools, or are schooled at home. The chairman of ISKCON's Board 
              of Education estimated that approximately 75% of all elementary 
              school aged children, and 95% of all secondary level students attend 
              non-ISKCON schools (M. dasa, 1992a). Most attend public schools 
              (Rochford, 1994a, 1996). 
            <p><b> De-communalisation, congregation-building, and transformation<br>
              </b>The emergence of the nuclear family changed the very structure 
              of ISKCON as a religious organisation. Devotee families became self-supporting 
              and increasingly independent of ISKCON and its control. ISKCON could 
              no longer assert totalistic claims over the lives and identity of 
              householders and their children. Freed from ISKCON control, householders 
              formed social enclaves between the larger culture and their local 
              ISKCON community. The result was the disintegration of ISKCON's 
              traditional communal structure. Having lost control over family 
              life, and with it the majority of the movement's membership, ISKCON 
              faced organisational change and transformation. Its sectarian structure 
              and lifestyle gave way under the weight of growing congregationalism 
              as householders took up residence in the suburbs of Krishna conscious 
              social life (Rochford, 1995a). 
            <p> Traditionally, the community served as ISKCON's primary unit of 
              social organisation. Like other communally based sectarian movements, 
              ISKCON sought to combine all aspects of daily life within co-ordinated, 
              centralised, and physically and socially bounded communities. Philosophically, 
              and practically, ISKCON members understood that association with 
              other devotees was vital to their spiritual progress. To wander 
              outside the confines of the devotee community represented a potential 
              threat to any ISKCON member seeking spiritual realisation in Krishna 
              Consciousness. (See Greil and Rudy, 1984; Lofland and Stark, 1965; 
              Snow and Phillips, 1980, on the influence of countervailing social 
              ties for commitment and conversion). 
            <p>ISKCON's communal structure afforded members the opportunity to 
              live and work in a reality-affirming enclave comprised of other 
              devotees. As we saw in Table 2, in 1980, ISKCON members worked almost 
              exclusively with other devotees. A scant 2% worked outside the movement. 
              Work represented 'devotional service', an offering to Krishna and 
              his devotees. Funds collected on <i>sankirtana</i> became communal 
              property, used to support the community as a whole and to carry 
              forward Prabhupada's preaching mission. As Kanter suggests, the 
              'sharing of resources and finances' serves as the key arrangement 
              distinguishing communes from other forms of social organisation 
              (1972:2). 
            <p>As the 1980s progressed, the economic strategies of ISKCON's membership 
              necessarily became more diverse and individualistic. Few devotees 
              continued to hold to the view that outside employment was a sign 
              of spiritual weakness. Only 5% of the ISKCON members surveyed, in 
              1991-92, agreed with the statement that, 'Working at a job outside 
              of ISKCON is maya'. But while there was a different attitude toward 
              outside employment there was also a new understanding of individual 
              versus communal resources. No longer did money earned by ISKCON 
              members go toward meeting community needs. Instead, householders 
              managed their own financial resources to meet the needs of their 
              families. Although Prabhupada emphasised that householders were 
              responsible for giving 50% of their income to support the movement 
              (1992:860), few have been able, or perhaps willing, to make such 
              a sacrifice. In large part, this reflects the fact that ISKCON families 
              have little discretionary income to contribute. The median income 
              category for ISKCON members, in 1991-92, was $6000-$15,000. 
            <p>But ISKCON's communal structure was undermined in even more direct 
              ways. The 1991-92 survey revealed that two-thirds of the devotee 
              respondents resided in non-ISKCON owned dwellings. Of those, nearly 
              six of ten (58%) lived a mile or more from their local ISKCON community. 
              Moreover, the majority (61%) reported that they wanted to maintain 
              their household independently of ISKCON. One reason for this seems 
              to be that many devotees have lost trust in ISKCON's ability to 
              tend to the needs of its membership. Sixty percent agreed with the 
              statement, 'I have lost trust in ISKCON's ability to look after 
              the material and economic needs of people like me.' Other reasons 
              can be found in the words of three householders living in ISKCON's 
              Northern Florida community, in 1993. 
            <ul>
              <p>I don't like living in too close proximity to devotees. I need 
                my space! I have personal projects I wish to oversee, and it's 
                easier to do that with a little distance between me and the temple.<br>
                I don't want to be under the thumb of any Temple President. <br>
                I value my own newly found independence. Therefore, I would not 
                choose to live on an ISKCON property.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#13">13</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>As householders began to create independent lives for themselves 
              and their families their relationship to ISKCON changed accordingly. 
              Nearly three-quarters (73%) of the householders surveyed agreed 
              that work and family obligations had placed limits on their ability 
              to commit more time to their local temple. Half (49%) expressed 
              the opinion that their family commitments were more important than 
              their commitment to ISKCON. Somewhat less than half (43%) agreed 
              that they had increasingly withdrawn from ISKCON to become more 
              involved in their family responsibilities. Finally, over half (53%) 
              held the view that most ISKCON members were more inclined to look 
              out for their own needs instead of the good of the devotee community.<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#14">14</a> 
              As these findings demonstrate, communal responsibility and sharing 
              has been undermined, if not displaced, by the needs of family life 
              (also, see Rochford, 1995a). 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b> Rosabeth Kanter (1972) in her classic work on nineteenth century 
              American utopian communities argued that marriage and family life 
              represented a threat to group commitment; that members would naturally 
              withdraw their loyalty to the group in favour of these relational 
              ties. By contrast, Rochford's (1995a) findings on ISKCON demonstrated 
              that family life was a barrier to group involvement, but not commitment. 
              Despite the contribution of each of these studies to our understanding 
              of religious and communal life, neither explicitly focuses on the 
              very foundation of group life-culture. More particularly, these 
              studies leave unexplored the complex interrelationship between marriage 
              and family life, cultural development, and the fate of alternative 
              movements and communities. 
            <p>During ISKCON's early days in North America, when its membership 
              was young and largely unmarried, and there were substantial revenues 
              flowing into its communities from <i> sankirtana,</i> the movement 
              was able to maintain a totalistic religious world within a communal 
              context. But when <i>sankirtana</i> revenues declined in 1977, only 
              to plummet in 1980, ISKCON was left without alternative 'communal 
              modes of production' (Cooper, 1987:1) to sustain an oppositional 
              religious culture. Without sufficient resources, and with the number 
              of families expanding at an unprecedented rate, ISKCON confronted 
              a cultural crisis that precipitated its decline and transformation. 
              Lacking the internal social institutions required to support family 
              life, ISKCON was left without the foundational elements of a religious 
              culture. As such, it remained 'culturally impoverished' (Lofland, 
              1995) and incapable of meaningfully integrating families into its 
              communities. This being the case, ISKCON witnessed the exodus of 
              householders and their families, with the resulting collapse of 
              its communal structure and sectarian way of life.<a

 href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#15">15</a> 
            <p>&nbsp;ISKCON's founder, Srila Prabhupada, foresaw the process of 
              change described here in many respects. While limits of space preclude 
              more than a cursory treatment, I would like to conclude by considering 
              Prabhupada's views on the role of culture in spiritual life. 
            <p> During the years just prior to his death in 1977, Prabhupada gave 
              increasing attention to the question of cultural development within 
              his movement. He expressed concern that ISKCON had failed to develop 
              a social and cultural system that would allow his disciples to live 
              peacefully in spiritual life. The seriousness of Prabhupada's concern 
              is indicated by a comment he made to a disciple that 50% of his 
              mission remained unfinished because the movement had failed to establish 
              <i>varnashrama</i> culture (M. dasa, 1992b). The following exchange 
              reported in a morning class in the Dallas ISKCON temple, in 1992, 
              echoes the same message: 
            <ul>
              <p>Toward the end of Prabhupada's stay [prior to his death], Prabhupada 
                at one point turned to the devotees with him and said, 'So I am 
                going to die. There is no lamentation [on my part].' Then a silence. 
                Finally, Prabhupada spoke up and said, 'Actually I have one lamentation.' 
                Bramananda asked, 'What is that Prabhupada; That you haven't finished 
                the <i>Bhagavatam</i>?' Prabhupada responded, 'No. That I have 
                not established <i>varnashrama</i>.' (M. dasa, 1992b). 
            </ul>
            <p>Beginning in 1974, during a series of morning walks with his closest 
              disciples in Vrndavana, India, Prabhupada detailed his vision for 
              the cultural development of ISKCON, as derived from the Vedic model 
              of <i>varnashrama</i>. As he described in 1975. 
            <ul>
              <p>The idea that I am giving, you can start anywhere, any part of 
                the world. It doesn't matter. Locally you produce your own food. 
                You get your own cloth. Have sufficient milk, vegetables. Then, 
                what more do you want? And chant Hare Krsna. This is Vedic civilisation: 
                plain living, high thinking (Mauritius, October 5, 1975). 
            </ul>
            <p>As he explained on one of his Vrndavan walks in 1974, the failure 
              to establish <i>varnashrama</i> invited the possibility of social 
              chaos. 
            <ul>
              <p>First of all <i>varna.</i> And <i>asrama,</i> then, when the 
                <i>varna</i> is perfectly in order, then <i> asrama.Asrama</i> 
                is specifically meant for spiritual advancement, and <i>varna</i> 
                is general division [within society]. It must be there in human 
                society, or they're on the animals [platform]. If <i>varna</i> 
                is not there, then this is a society of animal. (March 14, 1974).<a href="5_2rochfordfoot.html#16">16</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> Between 1974 and 1977 Prabhupada repeatedly returned to the question 
              of varnasrama. One indication of this is suggested by a study undertaken 
              by one of the movement's foremost authorities on <i>varnashrama</i>. 
              Of the 167 times that Prabhupada mentioned the word '<i>varnashrama</i>' 
              in his recorded conversations, 17% of these occurred prior to his 
              well-known '<i>varnashrama</i> Conversations', in 1974. Over the 
              course of the next three-and-a-half years leading up to his death, 
              Prabhupada mentioned the concept '<i>varnashrama</i>' the remaining 
              83% of the total recorded occasions (M. dasa, 1992b). 
            <p>There is every reason to believe that Prabhupada's preoccupation 
              with <i>varnashrama</i> grew out of the ongoing difficulty that 
              many, if not most, of his disciples were experiencing in spiritual 
              life. 
            <ul>
              <p>If you examine Prabhupada's instructions at the end of his life 
                . . . it's obvious he sees that his devotees who he initially 
                expected, or hoped, would come to the Brahmin Vaishnava platform, 
                had failed. That they couldn't maintain that standard . . . Prabhupada 
                recognised that we needed help. And that help was <i>varnashrama</i>. 
                Prabhupada realised that. He saw his devotees suffering from contact 
                with the material energy. That they had an inability to develop 
                a spiritual taste, and therefore were falling again and again 
                into material activities (M. dasa 1992b). 
            </ul>
            <p> As we have seen, Prabhupada's disciples, and those of his guru 
              successors, only became further entangled in the outside culture 
              during the 1980s and 1990s. As Prabhupada predicted, the absence 
              of a functioning movement culture left ISKCON and its membership 
              vulnerable to the influence of mainstream North American culture.
