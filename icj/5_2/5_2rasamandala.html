            <p>In my last article, I suggested that ISKCON was entering a new 
              and dynamic 'third phase' of development in which a systematic approach 
              towards training and education would be an important characteristic.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#1">1</a> 
              Since then, several education initiatives have progressed significantly.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#2">2</a>Nevertheless, 
              in some cases, they have aroused concern from some members of the 
              Society for drawing on philosophies and practices from beyond the 
              Vaisnava tradition. This essay will explore how one such discipline, 
              quite conventional in secular education, relates to its Vedic<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#3">3</a> 
              counterpart. It seems under scrutiny that the two are not inconsistent. 
              By amalgamating both we will produce a new model which will serve 
              as a basis for further research and development. This model can 
              also be used as a measure to examine where ISKCON stands in terms 
              of its evolution in education. Evidence will be presented to suggest 
              that formal education is perhaps the most important element in ISKCON's 
              continuing social and theological development. In conclusion, some 
              specific proposals will be put forward for the development of the 
              Society. 
            <p>In this study I will largely draw on my own experience, thus focusing 
              primarily on adult education, though many conclusions will also 
              be relevant to primary and secondary education (<i>gurukula</i>). 
              This essay is also a response to 'Education and ISKCON' presented 
              in the last issue of this journal by Sefton Davies.

              Knowledge, skills and values<br>

              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Comprehension of these three items are essential when establishing 
              the aims and objectives for any learning process as the aims and 
              objectives invariably fall within these three divisions. Furthermore, 
              various learning methods are deemed more or less appropriate for 
              each of these categories. Sefton Davies highlighted this in his 
              last article,<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#4">4</a> explaining the benefits 
              of experiential learning for teaching skills. He also highlights 
              the inordinate emphasis that ISKCON places on knowledge acquisition 
              and the corresponding modes of teaching. 
            <p>I have been using the knowledge, skills and values model for over 
              three years, particularly in training other devotees as teachers. 
              During this time I have personally become convinced of the value 
              of this method. The response from my students was also very positive. 
              Nevertheless, for some time I was feeling uneasy, on two accounts. 
            <p>Firstly, I had little conclusive scriptural endorsement for my 
              teaching practices, a point that contributed to some devotees questioning 
              their validity.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#5">5</a> Secondly, as I 
              attempted to gain a better understanding of my subject three important 
              questions remained unanswered: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>How do the three objectives rank chronologically? Is any one 
                predominant at a specific stage within the learning process?<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#6">6</a></li>
              <li> Is there a hierarchy of importance among the three, and if 
                so, what? </li>
              <li>Where does the concept of 'understanding' fit in?<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#7">7</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Naturally, my colleagues and I had our own ideas, largely distilled 
              from personal experience. In response to question (1) above, we 
              surmised that knowledge-transmission was typically predominant at 
              the start of any scheme of learning. Nevertheless, we were not sure 
              about the respective positions of 'skills' and 'values'. Do they 
              develop concurrently or one before the other? 
            <p>Our response to the second question was less equivocal. We concluded 
              that (within ISKCON at least) the category of 'values' achieves 
              top priority. We identified scriptural examples to support our case-that 
              the ultimate goal of education is to transform the nature of one's 
              <i>being</i> or, in other words, to become Krishna conscious. This 
              involves becoming humble, tolerant, compassionate and developing 
              all the twenty-six qualities of a Vaishnava.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#8">8</a> 
              A subsequent study of the first of 'The Seven Purposes of ISKCON', 
              adopted at the Society's incorporation in 1966, appeared to endorse 
              our conclusion that the whole thrust of ISKCON's education is to 
              effect a change in values.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#9">9</a> The 
              first of these purposes is 'To <i>systematically</i> propagate spiritual 
              <i>knowledge</i> to society at large and to educate all people in 
              the <i>techniques</i> of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance 
              of <i>values</i> in life and to achieve real unity and peace in 
              the world'. (Emphasis mine.) 
            <p>&nbsp;My observations were as follows: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Our three 'key words' are contained herein, 'skills' being replaced 
                with 'techniques'.</li>
              <li>Srila Prabhupada wishes our approach to be systematic-in other 
                words, 'formal education'. </li>
              <li> There is a tangible link between the Society's problems and 
                any imbalance in values. This is relevant in that it supports 
                the proposal that systematic training and education is one of 
                the most important ways of constructively addressing ISKCON's 
                internal, sociological issues.</li>
              <li>The ultimate purpose of education is to transform people's values: 
                that is <i>what we value</i>, which is so clearly connected to 
                how we perceive the world. Whilst developing education programmes 
                in ISKCON, many devotees considered that this was far more important 
                for devotees (or religious people in general) than for others. 
                Some, therefore, preferred the term 'character formation' in preference 
                to 'values and attitudes'. It is also clear that the ultimate 
                purpose of <i>Vaishnava</i> education is self-realisation. This 
                has raised the issue (though I will not address it here directly) 
                of whether or not 'character formation' is synonymous with self-realisation, 
                or superfluous to it. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b> Evidence from the Vedic scripture<br>
              </b>Despite these findings, we were far from a definitive understanding 
              of the education process. Then my god-brother, Bhakti Vidya Purna 
              Swami,<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#10">10</a> kindly directed my research 
              towards some interesting religious texts which shed some light on 
              my research. According to the <i> Brihadaranyaka Upanisad </i>(2.4.5), 
              there are three broad stages to any learning process. They are: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li><b><i>Sravana</i></b>-hearing knowledge from the teacher </li>
              <li><b><i>Manana</i></b>-gaining an intellectual understanding by 
                reflecting on what is learned.</li>
              <li><b><i>Nidhidhyasana</i></b>-realisation and application in one's 
                life.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>From this verse I deduced the following: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li> knowledge transmission is indeed the preliminary stage of education 
                (as we had suspected) </li>
              <li>understanding is part of a subsequent, second stage </li>
              <li>skills and values appear to be relevant later on (expressed 
                as 'application in one's life'<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#11">11</a> 
                and 'realisation'<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#12"> 12</a>).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Nevertheless, it was still not clear as to whether stage two (<i>manana</i> 
              or theoretical understanding) represents a progression from stage 
              one in terms of skills or values (or a combination of the two). 
              In other words, does knowledge transform into understanding through 
              the acquisition of skills, the development of appropriate values 
              or through the parallel evolution of both? Further insight was gained 
              from a verse in the <i>Nasadam</i>,<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#13">13</a> 
              a Sanskrit poetical work, where Shriharsha delineates the following 
              four stages of learning: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li><b><i>Adhiti</i></b>-to learn a subject thoroughly </li>
              <li><b><i>Bodha</i></b> -to gain insight and proficiency in one's 
                learning </li>
              <li><b><i>Acarana</i></b>-realising the purpose of, and living according 
                to, our learning </li>
              <li><b><i>Pracarana</i></b>-giving this knowledge to others </li>
            </ol>
            <p>It seems that the first three stages included in this verse from 
              the <i>Nasadam </i>correspond to those listed in the verse from 
              the <i>Brihadaranyaka Upanisad</i>. The fourth stage will not be 
              discussed here, although it is obviously important and clearly distinguished 
              from the other three. 
            <p>From the verse in the <i>Nasadam </i>it became clear that the second 
              stage, according to our developing Vedic model, not only encompasses 
              an intellectual grasp of the subject, but the concomitant practical 
              application of such an understanding. It seems that skills are learnt 
              primarily at this second stage. Nevertheless, there is not full-realisation, 
              nor have those skills become 'second-nature'. This only occurs in 
              the final stage (when perfection is achieved), where the knowledge, 
              understanding and skills become internalised, or part of oneself. 
              In other words, the student or apprentice <i>becomes </i>an engineer, 
              a carpenter or a teacher (or in Krishna conscious terms, a pure 
              devotee). He lives and breathes his subject, easily and effortlessly. 
              This suggests the platform of spontaneity.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#14"> 
              14</a> 
            <p><b>Towards an integrated philosophy of education<br>
              </b>It seems possible to conclude that this second stage of our 
              Vedic model corresponds to skills and the third to values (which 
              represents the ultimate goal of learning). By attempting to distinguish 
              clearly between these two stages I have postulated that each of 
              their outcomes correspond to 'conscious competence' and 'unconscious 
              competence' respectively.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#15">15</a> In 
              this process of learning knowledge is the predominant factor during 
              the first stage. In the second stage skills are the most predominant 
              factor and in the third stage, values are the most predominant. 
              This model seems incomplete, since knowledge, skills and values 
              cannot be neglected at any of the three stages. (See table 2.) 
            <p>&nbsp;In this model the three strands evolve in parallel throughout 
              the whole process and become perfectly integrated during the third 
              and final stage. Nevertheless, <i>the explicit emphasis of teaching 
              changes at each stage</i>. To clarify, knowledge progresses from 
              mere theoretical knowledge (conspicuous at the beginning of learning), 
              through intellectual understanding, to culminate in full-realisation. 
              Skills, latent in the beginning, form the focus of the second stage 
              and subsequently become fully internalised. It is here, at this 
              final stage that values take prominence, in the sense that knowledge 
              and actions must be integrated into one's life, becoming perfectly 
              congruent with self and desire.<a

 href="5_2rasafoot.html#16">16</a> It is the stage of becoming exemplary in thought, 
              word and deed, as expressed in the term acharana. 
            <p>For each strand three key characteristics are required of the student. 
              I have identified these from the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>; they are 
              namely inquiry, submission and service.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#17"> 
              17</a> The entire model, shown in table 2, may provide ISKCON with 
              a foundation for formulating a comprehensive philosophy of education, 
              firmly rooted in the Vaisnava tradition and explicitly endorsed 
              by scripture.

            <p align=CENTER><b>Table 2 <br>
              </b>The Three Phases of Learning in Terms of Knowledge, Skills and 
              Values 
            <p align=CENTER> 
            <p><b>Further research<br>
              </b>There remains ample scope for further research particularly 
              in scripture. Here are a few likely areas. The three terms 'knowledge', 
              'skills' and 'values' still beg precise definition.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#18">18</a> 
              The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, particularly chapter eighteen, yields 
              further information (especially verses 13-45). According to our 
              initial definition, values relate to 'being'. This alludes to the 
              self, which the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>describes as the 'knower' and 
              'the doer'.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#19">19</a> Values therefore 
              refers to the intrinsic nature of the self (however one conceives 
              of it), suggesting that this final stage of learning is identical 
              with 'the unfolding of the self', or realisation of one's <i>sva-dharma</i>.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#20">20</a> 
              It also suggests desire, since what we value is largely determined 
              by the nature of our desires. In fact, according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 
              our whole destiny rests upon the nature of our desire and the very 
              purpose of the spiritual path is to purify the heart of its materialistic 
              propensities.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#21">21</a> 
            <p> The other two terms, knowledge and action, cannot exist independent 
              of the self. (The converse is also true-there is no existence of 
              the self devoid of consciousness <i>and </i>activity.)<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#22">22</a> 
              There appears to be an ongoing reciprocation between the two, which, 
              I conclude, the experiential learning cycle demonstrates.<a

 href="5_2rasafoot.html#23">23</a> There are numerous other quotes in the <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>and other Vedic texts that demonstrate the various relationships 
              between our three strands.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#24">24</a> 
            <p> The analysis of education in terms of knowledge, skills and values 
              seems largely or wholly consistent with the Vedic model. Further, 
              I would suggest that the Vedic version positively embellish our 
              understanding of education and its ultimate purpose. Bhakti Vidya 
              Purna Swami has written, 'The thrust of education, therefore, must 
              be to develop character and philosophical realisation; external 
              knowledge and expertise are in a supportive role'.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#25"> 
              25</a> 
            <p><b>Part II </b> 
            <p>Here we will continue our exploration of the education procedure, 
              including that which is considered more progressive. We will examine 
              how it may be applicable within ISKCON and indeed, where it may 
              be inappropriate. We will focus on aims and objectives and how they 
              are delivered through a variety of teaching methods. Our conclusions 
              will again be useful in helping us analyse where ISKCON currently 
              stands and in formulating proposals for education development. 
            <p><b>Aims and objectives<br>
              </b>An essential feature in the design of any learning programme 
              is the clear definition of aims. In my last article, I identified 
              the pressing need to establish the concept of 'graduation from the 
              training <i>ashrams</i>' (<i>ashrams</i> are the four vedic developmental 
              divisions of the human life-cycle which are meant to elevate one 
              to spiritual perfection). This would enable the Society to keep 
              a focus on its main objective and to formulate clear aims in terms 
              of its most important resource-its committed members. Without such 
              formal education, there is no question of a deliberate and pro-active 
              approach towards developing the Society, and the various categories 
              of its membership. Shrila Prabhupada confirms the importance of 
              setting aims, comparing a man without aims to a ship without a rudder.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#26">26</a> 
            <p>We will examine later how the Society's trainers are often unclear 
              as to what constitutes their specific goals (although, quite ironically, 
              often claiming that they are obvious and hence require no explicit 
              delineation). We will return to this in Part Three. It is sufficient 
              to mention here that there are two further stages in planning developed 
              in response to the questions included below: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li><b>Aims</b>-What do you, or your organisation, want to achieve, 
                taking into account the learning needs of the students? </li>
              <li><b>Objectives</b> -What will students be able to do at the end 
                of your lesson or course which will demonstrate that you are meeting 
                your aims? </li>
              <li><b>Assessment</b>-How you will assess whether students are meeting 
                their objectives (and hence whether you are successful in meeting 
                your aims.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three steps are essential in planning and must be formulated 
              sequentially. The tendency is to look over them and to consider 
              content immediately, and I suspect that this is equally true for 
              both devotees and non-devotees alike. The reader may reflect on 
              his or her own preparation of a class or lecture. Most of us will: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>identify topics related to our main subject and </li>
              <li>determine what exciting learning experiences could be included</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If we are more experienced, we may also initially pinpoint a theme 
              that we intend to follow throughout. Even so, this approach remains 
              relatively ineffective. Education experts term it as 'content-driven'. 
              Teachers remain more concerned for <i>what </i>is taught rather 
              than for <i>why </i>they are teaching in the first place. It is 
              essential to have clearly focused aims without which we will undoubtedly 
              run into difficulties, such as leaning excessively towards knowledge-transmission. 
              This will result in the marginalisation of skills and values (though 
              this is not to suggest that the transmission of information is unimportant). 
              One of Sefton Davies' principal criticisms of ISKCON was that its 
              education processes focuses on knowledge acquisition, as demonstrated 
              by its predominant modes of teaching. 
            <p>Let us now examine some of these different methods and the possible 
              rationale behind them. 
            <p><b>Teaching methods and styles<br>
              </b>One aim of my training has been to broaden devotees' understanding 
              of what constitutes effective teaching and in particular trying 
              to introduce more interactive teaching methods. Most devotees have 
              warmly welcomed these changes as reflecting a positive shift in 
              values. Nevertheless (and quite understandably), these changes have 
              not been without their critics. A parallel debate exists in the 
              secular world between the advocates of traditional and progressive 
              practices. 
            <p>Sefton Davies highlights this dynamic, contrasting education which 
              is primarily concerned with 'putting in,' based on telling and with 
              that which is largely 'drawing out', based on asking. He writes, 
              'The extreme case of putting in is that of <i>indoctrination</i>, 
              where an educator wishes to implant a fixed set of ideas <i>and 
              to exclude the possibility of contrary ideas being considered and 
              accepted.</i>' Here he indirectly addresses two issues: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The correlation between any society's education and its style 
                of government (as a particular mode of education may well reflect 
                the prevailing ethos within its leadership). </li>
              <li>The dialectic between the needs for (a) authority (represented 
                by the Society) and (b) exercise of free will (as expressed through 
                the individual).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These are two essential points for ISKCON to consider and themes 
              we will pick up later in the article. 
            <p>Sefton Davies' statement implies that an education system favouring 
              'putting-in' may be rooted in the desire to preserve and perpetuate 
              a fixed set of ideas. Ideological groups, including ISKCON, fall 
              within this category. However, can they adopt progressive styles 
              of education? Sefton Davies has personally shared with me his conviction 
              that it is (almost) impossible. In other words, any organisation 
              with a fixed doctrine is obliged to be prescriptive. His ideas are 
              probably not without foundation. We may reasonably question how 
              ISKCON teachers can afford to draw answers from students since some 
              responses will inevitably be at variance with Gaudiya Vaishnava 
              theology. 
            <p>I will attempt to answer this question by relating an experience 
              from my own school days. Mr Jones, my physics teacher, would regularly 
              ask the class to conduct laboratory experiments. There was one in 
              particular that I recall. Our task was to measure the effective 
              weights of different objects immersed in water. We were then to 
              plot a graph of two sets of readings and estimate a corresponding 
              formula. On this day, I remember, I could not be bothered to finish 
              the experiment and besides, I was a theorist anyway and believed 
              that I already knew the correct answer. Therefore, I worked backwards, 
              constructing the graph from the formula, and then dotting co-ordinates 
              along its length. It was then easy to fill in the corresponding 
              'readings' and to gloat over my early finish. 
            <p> I was naturally convinced of the accuracy of my 'experiment', 
              but significantly less than if I had actually performed it! Nor 
              was the teacher anticipating much of a variation in the results 
              of his students. Why, then, did he have sufficient faith in his 
              students (providing, of course, that they correctly followed the 
              standard experimental procedure)? The answer seems to be clear: 
              <i>fundamental laws of nature cannot be contravened. </i>Consequently, 
              the events that such principles govern are entirely predictable. 
              According to Vaishnava theology, such universal laws apply just 
              as much to subtle phenomena (such as the mind and intelligence) 
              as to gross physical elements (such as earth and water), to living 
              beings as much as to dead matter. 
            <p>This evidence suggests that student-based learning is appropriate 
              when we are dealing with axiomatic or universal principles where 
              we consider the subject to be a science rather than merely faith 
              or belief. Conversely, such methods may <i>not </i>be suitable where 
              the predominant beliefs, values and practices of a society or individual 
              are incongruent with reality. Such ignorance can hardly flourish 
              in an atmosphere of open and honest inquiry, but requires a healthy 
              dose of unquestioning compliance, as is evident even in the scientific 
              world, as well as the 'overtly' religious. We may therefore rightly 
              suspect the integrity of any organisation or society, which restricts, 
              explicitly or implicitly, the right of the individual to inquire 
              openly. 
            <p>&nbsp;Another argument supporting a student-centred approach concerns 
              the residing place of knowledge, which the Vedas consider to be 
              locked within the heart.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#27">27</a> The 
              process of teaching is to unlock that inherent wisdom. The procedure 
              of 'drawing out' is consistent with this understanding and, if performed 
              expertly, it will yield accurate and effective results. 
            <p>My personal experience of teaching confirms this. If devotees observe 
              their spiritual practices, then the facilitator, through nurturing 
              honesty, introspection and self-expression, can usually evoke the 
              'right' answers from students themselves. Naturally, there are risks 
              involved for anyone who dares teach in a more dynamic, student-centred 
              way. It naturally puts an onus on the teacher to truly understand 
              and realise the subject or to admit his inadequacies.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#28">28</a> 
              In either case, it calls for depth of character and a willingness 
              to take risks! Again, this suggests that teaching methods reflect 
              not only the managerial or organisational ethos, as previously implied, 
              but the values held by teachers themselves.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#29">29</a> 
              This may further indicate that in borrowing methods of education 
              from outside ISKCON, devotees must be careful not to adopt values 
              which are inconsistent with their tradition.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#30">30</a> 
            <p><b>An analysis of experiential learning <br>
              </b> Certainly, my own support for progressive education practice 
              is not without qualification. For example, I often teach according 
              to the experiential learning cycle as Sefton Davies outlined in 
              his essay. See figure Figure 1. 
            <p align=LEFT>From a Krishna conscious perspective, however, this 
              process is to abstract not so much <i>ideas </i>as <i>realisations</i>. 
              Therefore, to differentiate between factual and erroneous conclusions, 
              <i>student perceptions</i><a href="5_2rasafoot.html#31"> 31</a><i> 
              must constantly be tested against scripture</i>.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#32">32</a> 
              This requires, in most cases, that students have some preliminary 
              scriptural knowledge. In addition, the process of drawing out answers 
              is dependent on the student having adequate experience of the subject. 
              These two conclusions further imply that 'putting in' is more appropriate 
              towards the beginning of any learning process, (at the stage of 
              knowledge acquisition) whereas drawing-out is more suitable later 
              on (when one tries to understand their realisations).

            <p align=LEFT>&nbsp;These two sets of criteria closely correspond 
              to the traditional and progressive models. I propose that each is 
              relevant, and each essential, at its respective stage.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#33">33</a> 
              The progressive model may not be appropriate without students having 
              passed through the earlier stage. Similarly, to maintain highly 
              didactic methods for mature students may prove equally counter-productive. 
            <p align=LEFT>The criteria listed above may again help us analyse 
              ISKCON in its provision of education opportunities. 
            <p><b>The importance of principles <br>
              </b>Let us return to our examination of experiential learning. We 
              have identified the need to speak of realisations rather than ideas. 
              Further, it seems the whole thrust of experiential learning is to 
              abstract not simply policies or guidelines, but primarily <i>principles</i>.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#34">34</a> 
              This point needs to be emphasised because unless a social group 
              understands the foundational principles behind its specific <i>raison-d'être 
              </i> it will not be able to effectively respond to changing circumstances, 
              nor preserve its tradition. Specifically, it must discern between 
              context-relevant instructions (or temporary policies) and unchanging, 
              axiomatic truths. Otherwise, it will commit one of two blunders: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>taking account of, and reacting to, changing circumstances and 
                public opinion, but losing grip on its core beliefs, values, mission 
                and so forth, or, </li>
              <li> sticking rigidly to externals, and to doctrine, often in the 
                name of preventing mission-shift, but losing the real essence 
                of that which needs to be preserved and perpetuated. </li>
            </ol>
            <p align=LEFT>It is essential that ISKCON preserves its legacy, and 
              in this training and education will play a vital role. 
            <p align=LEFT>A further advantage of a principle-based approach (over 
              one which simply defines practice and procedure) is that it legitimately 
              accommodates diversity. It maintains and communicates clear standards 
              by which to gauge a variety of practices. It does not promote a 
              culture of rigid compliance and conformity, but one which values 
              individuality and initiative (though within the bounds of the mission 
              which defines its membership). Additionally, a principle-based approach 
              will enable the mission to synthesise its conservative and radical 
              features and avoid fragmentation into various opposing camps. The 
              principles which form the bedrock of continuity are found within 
              Shrila Prabhupada's books.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#35">35</a> 
            <p><b>The role of scripture<br>
              </b>One may, however, question the need to use experiential learning 
              at all. The Vedas are considered infallible. Why not just accept 
              them-end of story? One danger to such a prescriptive approach, especially 
              devoid of the opportunity to question, is that students fail to 
              question not only the validity of scripture, but also <i>their understanding 
              </i>of such sacred injunctions. Consequently, they may <i>pretend 
              </i>to understand, or possess the prescribed levels of conviction. 
              Lack of opportunity to clear away doubts subsequently impedes progress. 
              This naturally involves a degree of self-deception. Leaders and 
              teachers in such societies may be more concerned with belief and 
              faith allegiance than an open exploration of truth. There may also 
              be a preference for 'yes-men', an 'us and them' mind-set and a reliance 
              on hype, slogans, and peer-pressure to support practices that are 
              often carefully tended as sacred cows. 
            <p align=LEFT>Therefore, we may conclude that an effective education 
              system promotes understanding and realisation achieved by internalisation 
              of knowledge derived from appropriate authority. 
            <p><b>The basis of commitment<br>
              </b>Our discussion raises another question: is commitment based 
              on a full exploration of facts or a suspension of the critical faculties? 
              In the eighteenth chapter of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, Lord Krishna 
              apparently supports the former option, favouring the well-informed 
              decision. After instructing Arjuna for the best part of an hour, 
              the Lord tells him, 'Thus I have explained to you knowledge more 
              confidential. Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish 
              to do.' Shrila Prabhupada further explains in his purport, 'Surrender 
              to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of 
              the living entities. It is not for the interest of the Supreme. 
              Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as 
              far as the intelligence goes; <i>that is the best way to accept 
              the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead</i>.'<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#36">36</a> 
              This text not only endorses teaching methods which stimulate real 
              understanding, but enrolment policies which acknowledge the free 
              will and individuality of the student. 
            <p align=LEFT> Assessment should precede each stage of commitment, 
              so that the candidate can take full responsibility for his or her 
              decision. Contrary procedure may lead to premature commitment, which 
              not only causes later retractions, but may also result in bitterness 
              towards the organisation that failed to meet unrealistic expectations. 
              A society such as ISKCON has a responsibility to explain clearly 
              to candidates their future prospects and any corresponding rights 
              and responsibilities. 
            <p align=LEFT> Any enrolment policy simultaneously requires the clear 
              understanding of the specific purposes of that particular programme. 
              Unfortunately, as we will see later, there are very few ISKCON initiatives 
              with such clearly focused aims. In fact, until recently there has 
              hardly been any formal education at all. In other words, the Society 
              and its leaders have not yet recognised the benefits. Which leads 
              to the obvious question-why not? 
            <p><b>Leadership and values<br>
              </b> Whatever the answer to this, it is clear that education does 
              not take place within a vacuum. It requires not only endorsement 
              but also the active and heartfelt support of the entire Society 
              and particularly its leadership. 
            <p align=LEFT>Values are determined not so much by what is spoken 
              from the <i>vyasasana </i>(elevated seat for a teacher in class). 
              Rather, they are largely moulded by social interactions, particularly 
              through forms of reward and punishment (however subtle). Therefore, 
              the prevalent leadership ethos will significantly determine the 
              nature of a Society's education system. It is also the duty of leaders 
              to ensure, through appropriate evaluation, that their organisation 
              is on course for meeting its aims. 
            <p align=LEFT>From my experience, I see striking parallels between 
              the managerial and education processes. Secular management often 
              recognises the importance of on-going training for its entire staff. 
              Nevertheless, in these professional organisations, training is usually 
              a matter of expediency in meeting financial goals. It is clear that 
              ISKCON's very aims are education-based, as revealed through the 
              first of its Seven Purposes. For this reason, the managerial function 
              must serve the education processes, rather than vice versa. The 
              following analysis of ISKCON and subsequent proposals are intended 
              especially for consideration by the leaders of the Society. 
            <p><b>Part III <br>
              </b> So far, we have explored the learning process in terms of (1) 
              knowledge, skills and values and (2) aims and objectives. We have 
              also examined briefly some variety in teaching methods and identified 
              the need for education to be principle-based and grounded in scripture. 
              In so doing, we have identified criteria to help us ascertain how 
              far and how effectively ISKCON's education has progressed and where 
              there is further room for improvement. 
            <p align=LEFT> This naturally involves identifying the Society's shortcomings: 
              not in a mood of criticism but as an attempt to move realistically 
              and constructively forward. Despite the challenges-and they are 
              numerous-there are indications as I mentioned in my earlier article, 
              that the movement is positively evolving as it enters 'Phase Three' 
              of its development. 
            <p> Identifying areas in need of improvement 
            <p><b>Knowledge</b> 
            <p>(1) <i>There is an over-emphasis on knowledge-acquisition <br>
              </i> Four years ago, at a public function in Bristol, I was chatting 
              to a lady who was a member of the congregation. She had recently 
              attended one of my weekend courses on teacher training. I was encouraging 
              her to try leading a local class. She, however, was hesitant. Finally, 
              she revealed that she felt unqualified. 'I don't know enough <i>slokas</i>!' 
              (verses from the scriptures), she admitted. I was astounded! Here 
              was a middle-aged woman, a certified counsellor, who had successfully 
              raised a family and demonstrated maturity in personal and professional 
              circles. I was simultaneously bewildered and enlightened! I was 
              convinced that the values prevalent in our temples were spilling 
              over into the congregation. She had the necessary skills and the 
              appropriate attitudes-yet considered the verses she could recite 
              the primary qualification for representing the Society. 
            <p align=LEFT> It would be interesting, if not revealing, to ask academics, 
              media and faith leaders who have an interest in ISKCON what they 
              expect of our members. I suspect that they would give greater emphasis 
              to character and behaviour. We could also reflect on what our own 
              tradition says about the respective priorities afforded to knowledge, 
              skills and values. 
            <p align=LEFT>(2) <i>Education methods are almost entirely teacher-centred. 
              <br>
              </i> Within ISKCON temples, lecturing remains the prevalent mode 
              of teaching. Devotees are reluctant to use other means, often doubting 
              their validity. Some consider them non-traditional, or even heretical, 
              citing our standard process of descending knowledge from guru to 
              disciple. 
            <p align=LEFT>Amongst some progressive non-devotee educators, lecturing 
              is considered suitable for little more than knowledge-transmission. 
              Conversely, within Vaishnavism, a morning class is a place of honour 
              and cannot be equated with mere information-transfer. On this point, 
              there seems to be a clear rift between non-devotee specialists and 
              the tradition itself. I have noted that the morning <i>Bhagavatam 
              </i>class does not take place in isolation. It is one part of an 
              entire process, which has other highly experiential components. 
              Lectures are delivered most effectively at the end of the 'morning 
              programme.' The attendant spiritual practices, particularly the 
              chanting of the names of Krishna on <i>japa </i>beads, enhance the 
              consciousness, making the practitioner far more aware and receptive 
              to hearing. During the lecture, an effective teacher will draw from 
              life experience, speaking with direct realisation, which will powerfully 
              transform the heart of the sincere listener. The devotee then carries 
              forward what is learned into the day's service, meditating on the 
              teacher's words. My own perception of this process is that even 
              the lecture itself can be highly experiential, with the potency 
              to transform values. 
            <p align=LEFT>For formal temple situations, I am reluctant to suggest 
              that devotees use radically different methods. Nevertheless, there 
              is scriptural evidence for using such technique (as we have already 
              examined). We have heard how realisation is one of the ultimate 
              goals of education. Let us now examine how Shrila Prabhupada defines 
              the word: 
            <ul>
              <p>Personal realisation does not mean that one should, out of vanity, 
                attempt to show one's own learning by trying to surpass the previous 
                acharyas. He must have full confidence in the previous acharyas, 
                and at the same time he must realise the subject matter so nicely 
                that he can present the matter for the particular circumstances 
                in a suitable manner. The original purpose of the text must be 
                maintained. No obscure meaning should be screwed out of it, yet 
                it should be presented in an interesting manner for the understanding 
                of the audience. This is called realisation. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT> &nbsp;This endorses the principle of adjusting one's 
              presentation to suit the audience, and may indeed support the whole 
              concept of progressive education technique. I suggest that devotees 
              should seriously consider using progressive education techniques 
              outside the context of a temple lecture. 
            <p align=LEFT>(3) <i>The Society has little promotional material beyond 
              canonical literature. <br>
              </i> Recently, my father asked me to bring, on behalf of a friend, 
              some basic Krishna conscious literature. 'Nothing too fancy', he 
              specified. I happily agreed, but subsequently felt quite embarrassed 
              with what I <i>could not </i>find. There was no information on devotees 
              and their personal stories; very little on the Society's cultural 
              heritage; next-to-nothing on the opportunities it offers the public; 
              and little with any pictures! However, there are stacks of books 
              simply on doctrine, which, for most people, is quite inaccessible 
              to the newcomer. 
            <p align=LEFT>Although theology is of the utmost importance for ISKCON, 
              many devotees now consider this insufficient on its own. They acutely 
              feel the need to practically live and demonstrate their teachings, 
              and to 'walk their talk'. For a society of our size and prominence, 
              the lack of suitable literature reveals, again, an inordinate emphasis 
              on knowledge alone and perhaps a reluctance to share ourselves with 
              those outside the movement. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Skills </b> 
            <p align=LEFT>(4) <i>Little importance is attached to skills training. 
              <br>
              </i>Lack of skills training is evident in several ways. I have often 
              observed capable devotees performing relatively low-level tasks 
              in comparison to their non-devotee counterparts. ISKCON may indeed 
              have difficulty affording comparable training systems. What is becoming 
              apparent, though, is the immense cost of <i>not </i>training members 
              and the gross inefficiency of constantly re-inventing the wheel. 
              Inadequate skills also become conspicuous in areas that determine 
              public perception, such as our reception and telephone services. 
              The whole issue of public credibility can be effectively measured 
              in terms of skills and values, as these are reflected through conduct 
              and behaviour. Skills and values can be constructively addressed 
              through appropriate training schemes. 
            <p align=LEFT>Another key issue is the lack of vocational training 
              for the vast majority of residential devotees who eventually marry. 
              The question often arises as to whether or not this is indeed the 
              responsibility of the Society. 
            <p align=LEFT>(5) <i>There is little or no service assessment and 
              insufficient accountability. <br>
              </i> Sincerity is often considered the sole qualification for maintaining 
              a position within the Society. Any attempt to assess devotees' performance 
              as functionaries may be construed as an affront to their spiritual 
              integrity. In temple leadership, the coups that sporadically tear 
              down temple presidents may be rightly attributed to a lack of formalised 
              evaluation. In the 1980s, initiating gurus were promoted to jet-set 
              executives, simply because of their spiritual standing. They were 
              equally expected to be knowledgeable on all aspects of life, whatever 
              their factual experience, placing them under considerable pressure 
              to perform according to such unrealistic expectations.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#37">37</a> 
            <p align=LEFT> A corollary of these phenomena has been the reluctance 
              of temple devotees to engage the skills of congregational experts 
              whose spiritual practices failed to meet temple standards. 
            <p align=LEFT>In conclusion, material propensities and spiritual qualifications 
              have been totally muddled. What is ironic here is the apparent emphasis 
              on values, which does not bear up to scrutiny, as we will now see. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Values </b> 
            <p align=LEFT>(6) <i> There is a lack of congruence between the theoretical 
              knowledge and values that devotees demonstrate. <br>
              </i>The early nineteen-eighties heralded the recognition of the 
              disparity between devotees' theology and their corresponding practices. 
              Shortcomings in values were reflected through poor, often shocking, 
              personal conduct and a striking increase in social anomalies. 
            <p align=LEFT>I have listed below some of the values that the Society 
              seems to have nurtured in its members, perhaps unconsciously, and 
              which are inconsistent with scripture: 
            <ul>
              <p>(a) <i>Short-term results have been rewarded more highly than 
                long-term commitment.<br>
                </i>Scripture emphasises the relative benefits of <i>sreyas </i>(ultimate 
                good) over <i>preyas </i>(the immediate result). Despite this, 
                new devotees who have contributed significantly towards fund-raising 
                initiatives have often received far greater acclaim from leaders 
                than older devotees who are no longer so financially productive. 
                It is therefore questionable, from an education perspective, whether 
                the appreciation a member receives is commensurate with his or 
                her factual spiritual advancement (as it should be). One noticeable 
                result has been that leadership often caters more effectively 
                for its younger followers but faisl to maintain their commitment 
                as these young followers mature.<br>
                (b) <i>Devotees have favoured 'transcendence' in preference to 
                'mundane morality'.<br>
                </i> In the early days devotees failed to appreciate the important 
                and sustaining role of morality in the long, and often gruelling, 
                journey towards transcendence. Self-realisation, or perception 
                of the self as separate from the mind and body, was considered 
                quite different from character development. These attitudes naturally 
                mitigated the need for introspection and any deliberate assessment 
                of one's personal values. <br>
                (c) <i> External renunciation has been valued far more than integrity 
                and personal responsibility. <br>
                </i>The leaning towards artificial renunciation and consequent 
                irresponsibility is particularly evident when studying the <i>brahmacaris</i>' 
                (celibate students) often negative attitudes towards marriage. 
                The <i>grihasta ashram</i> for married householders has often 
                been equated, quite erroneously, with materialistic household 
                life. The consequences for <i>brahmacaris </i>changing <i>ashrams 
                </i> have been predictably disastrous.<br>
                (d) <i>The prevalence of the 'welfare mentality'.<br>
                </i>Devotees have often expected the Society to provide far more 
                of their needs than it has been able and have eventually become 
                disappointed. This raises the question of establishing mutual 
                expectations, and the qualifications of the candidate for residential 
                training, particularly in respect of their values. For example, 
                some candidates may already possess desirable traits, such as 
                honesty and cleanliness, whereas others are practically incorrigible 
                even after training. Residential training, some suggest, should 
                primarily be for more independent, thoughtful people who have 
                a strong sense of vocation. <br>
                (e) <i>Unquestioning allegiance has been given preference to thoughtful 
                commitment. <br>
                </i>Faith based on suspension of the critical faculties certainly 
                results in a quick commitment, but usually not a lasting one. 
                <br>
                (f) <i>Spirituality is measured largely on the basis of external 
                practices, rather than inner development. <br>
                </i>Although strict adherence to <i>sadhana </i>is undeniably 
                essential, there has been little open dialogue about personal 
                issues and what is really going on within the devotee's heart. 
            </ul>
            <p>(7) <i>Scripture has been misused to endorse erroneous practices 
              and their attendant values. <br>
              </i> ISKCON has its share of emotionally charged words, which often 
              embody unquestionable truths and values. For example, when a devotee 
              is insensitive, he or she is invariably described as 'impersonal', 
              with all its negative connotations.<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#38">38</a> 
              Other terms worthy of exploration include 'surrender', 'humble', 
              'independent' and 'motivated'. Although these terms are theologically 
              significant, they may have been unconsciously misinterpreted for 
              tendentious purposes, usually related to maintaining a high degree 
              of hands-on control (such as for example, to keep the work-force 
              enthusiastically active). 
            <p>(8) <i>Business </i>(vaishya)<i> values have been predominant. 
              <br>
              </i> Inappropriate values lie at the heart of many of the Society's 
              challenges and may be the natural consequence of the leaders' emphasis 
              on productivity, which itself has been moulded by circumstantial 
              economic pressures, rather than as a direct fault of the management 
              itself. Those with brahminical tendencies (who tend to be independently 
              resourceful) have not always found appreciation or satisfying services 
              within the Society. Many, after living initially in temples, have 
              ultimately pursued more academic careers away from the Society. 
            <p>(9) <i>Discerning people have been reluctant to become closely 
              involved. <br>
              </i>Less-discerning residents have frightened away more intelligent 
              candidates, namely those with higher values. Many temple residents 
              became highly dependent on the institution for their material needs 
              and failed to win respect from the professional classes. When teaching 
              and questioned on subjects beyond their capacity, they often became 
              defensive, attempting to maintain their own perceived superiority 
              by borrowing strength, for example, from position or the length 
              of time they have spent in the movement. Traditionally the temple 
              and its residents are expected to be exemplary and such training 
              should be reserved for men and women of the highest calibre. 
            <p><b>Formal education </b> 
            <p>(10)<i> There is little formulation of people-centred goals. <br>
              </i>Members, according to their respective levels of commitment, 
              constitute ISKCON's most valuable asset and yet cars, books and 
              property have taken priority in setting goals. Material assets have 
              been often been considered the means to secure followers, rather 
              than vice-versa. This calls for a re-evaluation of the actual purposes 
              of the Society. 
            <p>(11) <i>There is very little continuity and progression.<br>
              </i> Many congregational members complain that they have been listening 
              to the 'you are not this body' class for many years. Similar concerns 
              are expressed by temple residents. Both education content and methodology 
              lack continuity and progression. Teaching methods and styles are 
              more suitable for newer members. The rationale behind this is that: 
              (a) hearing is purifying anyway and (b) repetition is necessary, 
              because we tend to repeatedly forget and fall into <i>maya </i> 
              (illusion). This approach does not acknowledge and validate the 
              intelligence of students, nor recognise the progress they will have 
              inevitably made if education procedures are sound. 
            <p>(12) <i>There are few clearly delineated systems and structures 
              for training. <br>
              </i>Less than thirty per cent of all temples world-wide have an 
              initial course for new-comers to temple life (bhakta / bhaktin courses), 
              what to speak of more extensive developmental programmes. Intelligent 
              people, who plan for the future, perceive few carefully formulated 
              prospects for a lifetime of spiritual growth. For many devotees 
              Krishna consciousness remains a distant dream rather than a goal 
              towards which they are consistently and perceivably moving. 
            <p>(13) <i>No clear enrolment policies. <br>
              </i> In most temples, the criteria for who is eligible to join remains 
              a mystery and has thus been highly subjective (and hence subject 
              to gross inaccuracy). Candidates, who may have been accepted to 
              ensure that the pots are washed, often turn out to be quite unsuitable 
              for ashram life. 
            <p>(14) <i>New devotees are considered manpower rather than students. 
              <br>
              </i>Temple departmental heads have sometimes resisted moves to introduce 
              systematic training, fearing an initial loss of manpower. Ironically, 
              formal training and education is ultimately intended (amongst other 
              things) to equip temples with highly qualified staff. <i>What is 
              clear is that the Society has not considered education a priority. 
              </i>Fortunately, opinions are shifting; most notably amongst the 
              leadership, indicating that ISKCON is indeed entering a new phase 
              that is characterised by rapid strides in education. 
            <p><b>Proposals <br>
              </b> The following proposals will be of particular interest to ISKCON 
              devotees, especially leaders, managers and educators. We need to: 
            <p>(1) Clearly establish the vision, identity and function of all 
              ISKCON temples, with specific emphasis on their primary role as 
              education institutes. 
            <p>(2) (a) Identify the different groups who have education needs. 
              I have isolated four major categories namely: 
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p>(i) leaders and managers <br>
                  (ii) residential devotees (i.e. students) <br>
                  (iii) congregational members <br>
                  (iv) common-interest groups<a href="5_2rasafoot.html#39">39</a> 
              </ul>
              <p>(b) Establish specific purposes of training and education for 
                each of these groups. <br>
                (c) For each group we establish paths of involvement, with aims 
                and objectives for each stage of training in terms of knowledge, 
                skills and understanding, and values. <br>
                (d) Each discipline within the Society establishes an education 
                team that will formulate the principles upon which its development 
                is based. These should largely come from Shrila Prabhupada's works. 
                These principles will then be used to evaluate its training policies 
                and practices. 
            </ul>
            <p>(3) Corresponding enrolment policies should be established for 
              all training courses and thereafter, scheduled periods of commitment 
              and assessment. 
            <p> (4) We publish appropriate advertising material which clearly 
              differentiate between: (a) our theology (b) our understanding and 
              experience of Krishna consciousness (c) the opportunities which 
              ISKCON offers to individuals for interaction with the Society. 
            <p>(5) Members who enter the Society for residential training do so 
              with clear understanding of their future prospects. They should 
              enter on a contractual basis with defined rights and responsibilities. 
            <p> (6) All teachers and trainers will be trained and accredited, 
              according to international standards. 
            <p>(7) All managers should be trained, particularly to appreciate: 
            <ul>
              <p>(a) the basic principles of leadership and management with regard 
                to dividing society and training accordingly<br>
                (b) the value of supporting those with brahminical functions <br>
                (c) the importance of continually improving the organisational 
                culture of the Society, and ensuring that its representatives 
                are aligned with its mission. 
            </ul>
            <p>(8) Strong links should be forged between managers and educators 
              to implement all the above and to ensure that the management procedures 
              serve the education purposes of the Society, and that the predominant 
              values within the Society are brahminical. This means that leadership 
              and management should be pro-active rather than reactive, responding 
              to situations promptly and anticipating what may be required in 
              the future. 
            <p><b>Conclusions <br>
              </b>Our discussion points to the need for a social system that is 
              based on the universal principle of service to Lord Krishna, and 
              yet accommodates all types of people with diverse values. This suggests 
              that the predominant values of the Society must be brahminical, 
              that is based on moral and ethical standards derived from scripture. 
              Since intellectual and religious leadership is naturally concerned 
              for the welfare of others, they base their decisions on principles, 
              rather than on political, economic or sensual expediency. We have 
              noted how any society's problems are rooted in an imbalance of values. 
              Our system must be one that can redress its imbalance of values 
              and address spiritual challenges-this I believe will come principally 
              through the education forum. In addition, a principle-based education 
              system may be the most effective arena for addressing ISKCON's current 
              social challenges. Furthermore, the suggestions outlined in this 
              discussion may provide a useful tool for delivering such remedial 
              measures. If the managerial and education leaders can co-operate 
              to introduce systematic training and education based on the principles 
              found in Srila Prabhupada's writings, then everything else will 
              naturally follow.
