            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>The future of Hinduism in Britain is by no means easy to predict. 
              The history of Hindu traditions within Britain does not go back 
              all that far, and the ways in which it is practised and perceived 
              certainly appear to have developed considerably since the 1970s, 
              when Hindu temples first become established in significant numbers. 
              Over the next twenty to thirty years the maturation of a new generation 
              of Hindus will produce an as yet unknown development for the maintenance 
              of the Hindu traditions. 
            <p>Recently, I have been surveying the feelings of Hindus across Britain-I 
              have mailed out questionnaires to Hindus (namely to people with 
              Hindu names) asking questions on a number of factors related to 
              their religiosity. At the end of the questionnaire I asked the question: 
              'Do you think that Hinduism in Britain is likely to change over 
              the next twenty years?' and 'please give reasons for your answer'. 
              So far I have only received about 45 responses from 190 questionnaires 
              posted- I still have a long way to go before I will have achieved 
              a good cross section of Hindu life. But I am very much struck by 
              the number of responses that I have received which predict a decline 
              in Hinduism: over half have said it will change for the worse in 
              some way, mostly because of the pressures on young Hindus to become 
              westernised, resulting in the loss of their religion and culture. 
              Thus according to two respondents: 
            <ul>
              <p>The current generation is being brought up in the 'British way', 
                i.e. more tolerance for drink, sex, etc. As time goes on our culture 
                will slowly die and become more faint as families are more westernised. 
              <p>Yes Hinduism will change: (there will be) fewer young generation, 
                a loss of traditions, especially the understanding and meaning 
                of customers, maybe a 'soulless' generation in terms of Hinduism. 
                (There will be) a drifting generation seeking salvation and solace 
                and forgetting that 'it' was always there. 
            </ul>
            <p>The main fear is that in the next generation there will be few 
              who wish to (or are able) to maintain the traditions which their 
              parents or grandparents brought from India. This will be partly 
              due to their own indifference, but also because of the indifference 
              of their parents. Thus according to these three respondents: 
            <ul>
              <p>The new generation is not going to be much interested (in religion). 
                I hate to say that. I am very much upset as well. 
              <p>Over the generation less and less Hindu tradition is passed on. 
              <p>We will be westernised completely. My wife was born and brought 
                up in the UK. We therefore hardly celebrate any of our own culture 
                apart from Diwali. Our daughter speaks no Indian [sic.] at all. 
                She will not know anything about her own culture because there 
                is no one to tell her. 
            </ul>
            <p>But the decline may also be a product of the ways in which Hinduism 
              is presented institutionally: 
            <ul>
              <p>I am afraid in my opinion Hinduism will suffer a decline in 20 
                years to come. Very few youngsters follow or understand the great 
                Hindu religions / traditions. They are far too liberal. Liberal 
                or ignorant preachers in temples do the daily rituals but they 
                don't themselves know / understand the golden principles of Hinduism. 
            </ul>
            <p>I have received many similar responses which follow this line of 
              thinking things are going to change for British Hindus and generally 
              for the worse. 
            <p>So how does ISKCON fit into this? Back in the 1980s (and still 
              in some quarters today) one did not have to look too hard to find 
              fairly similar predictions being made of the future of ISKCON. The 
              demise of the Hare Krishnas seemed almost inevitable, with the death 
              of Srila Prabhupada, the scandals of the gurus and the seeming lack 
              of interest from new generations who had lost sight of the hippie 
              ideals, all pointed to a religion which could not survive in a fiercely 
              secular world. 
            <p>But when you put ISKCON together with British Hindus you have an 
              interesting combination as the two groups are currently thriving 
              in a mutual relationship in Britain, which bodes well for the future 
              of them both. In this paper I will discuss how the various forms 
              of Hinduism are being shaped by the influences of ISKCON. By turning 
              towards the 'Hindu community'<a href="#1">1</a> ISKCON precipitated 
              developments which are not merely limited to themselves but may 
              also lead to significant changes in the way Hindu traditions are 
              expressed in the British context. It is quite likely that ISKCON 
              can and probably will have a strong and important influence both 
              directly and indirectly. On a direct level ISKCON reach a significant 
              number of Hindu population-through their worship, preaching and 
              literature. On an indirect level they have the potential to play 
              the part of a 'pace setter' for other groups to follow, in a similar 
              (although also very different) way in which the Ismailis had considerable 
              influence among many East African religious communities in the mid 
              decades of this century.<a href="#2">2</a> 
            <p><b>ISKCON and Indian Hindu<br>
              </b>The main problem faced by ISKCON devotees and British Hindus 
              is the extent to which ISKCON is 'Hindu', or to put it more accurately 
              the extent to which what ISKCON does (in ritual and teachings, for 
              example), fits in with the expectations of Hindus in Britain who 
              previously had no real experience of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. For most 
              ISKCON devotees the label of 'Hinduism' as a description of their 
              religion is one they are happy with, as a loose translation of the 
              more indigenous term <i>sanatana dharma</i> in Hindi. But even so, 
              there is within ISKCON a minority of devotees who do not like the 
              term Hinduism, which they feel has a lot of connotations which are 
              irrelevant to them. In particular for them 'Hinduism' is the mish-mash 
              (<i>khitchri</i>) of religious beliefs and practices that misrepresent 
              and distort the Vedic teachings. The lead is taken here from Srila 
              Praphupada's own writings on the matter in which he clearly states 
              that Krishna consciousness is <i>not</i> Hindu.<a href="#3">3</a> 
              Many of these non-Hindu devotees wish to retain the internationalism 
              of ISKCON and see the primary purpose of the ISKCON <i>yatra</i> 
              (organisation) as being to preach to, and convert, the indigenous 
              white population of Britain. So in this sense, the 'Indianisation', 
              or more accurately perhaps, the 'Hinduisation' of ISKCON is not 
              absolute. Of course, the ethnic composition of ISKCON reflects a 
              diversity of backgrounds and probably no more than one third of 
              initiated devotees in Britain are of Indian ancestry, whilst the 
              reminder are from British, American, Eastern European, African and 
              other backgrounds. 
            <p>But one can observe a large emphasis on the part of ISKCON in recent 
              years to engage with the idea of Hinduism, and to identify themselves 
              as part of the <i>sanatana dharma</i>, in the main arguing that 
              theirs is the most accurate representation of the eternal religion. 
              In the majority of their public statements ISKCON has been very 
              clear in saying that they are most definitely Hindu, and point to 
              the large level of support that they receive from Indian Hindus 
              as proof of their authenticity as Hindus. 
            <p> The large extent of this support from the 'Indian (Hindu) community' 
              should not be taken for granted. The large majority of Indian Hindus 
              who worship at ISKCON temples and centres (most particularly Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor) are of Gujarati ancestry, and come from a region and culture 
              far removed from the Bengali roots of ISKCON. One could argue that 
              there are a number of factors that have encouraged so many Gujarati 
              Hindus to turn to ISKCON to meet some or all of their religious 
              needs in Britain. One particular factor may be the convenience of 
              Bhaktivedanta Manor for the large population of mainly East African 
              Gujaratis who are living in north west London (although the traffic 
              problems and threat of closure which bedevilled the Manor for so 
              many years could hardly justify anyone thinking it was 'convenient'). 
              Of course, the Vaisnavite theology of ISKCON, and in particular 
              the very accessible worship of Radha Krishna, are also very important 
              factors for many Hindus visiting ISKCON centres. I think it would 
              be fair to say that of the thousands of Indian Hindus who visit 
              Bhaktivedanta Manor on Janmasthami in summer each year, the majority 
              will be going first and foremost to worship Krishna and the fact 
              that it is an ISKCON centre will be of far less interest to them 
              than that it is a Krishna temple. Of course a number of those who 
              visit out of general interest do become much more deeply involved 
              with Krishna Consciousness, but for many interaction with ISKCON 
              does not entail any high degree of commitment to ISKCON's ideals 
              or teachings. 
            <p>From my questionnaire returns, twenty-four respondents (that is 
              over half of the total) have been at some time to either Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor, or the central London temple in Soho Street. Many of these 
              had very positive comments to make about ISKCON as an institution, 
              such as the following: 
            <ul>
              <p>(Bhaktivedanta Manor) is a good holy place. 
              <p>It is a good institute to maintain Hinduism in this country. 
              <p> It's a good institution, run in a professional way by dedicated 
                people. 
              <p>I am not a devotee but I think they are a no-nonsense group doing 
                their bit in their own way. 
              <p>I feel it is doing a tremendous job making the wider society 
                understand some parts of Hinduism in Britain. 
              <p>I am surprised to see that most of these followers are Europeans 
                and they are following this faith much more accurately than the 
                original Hindus. 
              <p>Very organised devotees and true, honest to their religion. 
            </ul>
            <p>But there is certainly an engagement on a substantial level between 
              ISKCON and many Hindus, and I wish to argue here that this engagement 
              is a two way process: ISKCON is feeding into the milieu of British 
              Hinduism and on a number of levels they are becoming an important 
              player in the public and private debates on the direction of Hinduism 
              in Britain. Of course, ISKCON are by no means the only players on 
              the scene of British Hinduism. There are many other Hindu groups 
              who are also having a strong influence on the shaping of Hinduism, 
              most of whom have very different visions of what Hinduism is and 
              how it should be practised. But amongst other factors that ISKCON 
              have had in their favour is that they are one of the best organised 
              Hindu groups in Britain and they also seem to have the ability to 
              get things done. On both national and private levels, these two 
              things make a huge difference. 
            <p><b>ISKCON and the development of Hinduism on a national leveL<br>
              </b>ISKCON, through Bhaktivedanta Manor, have been involved with 
              the National Council of Hindu Temples (NCHT) since the 1970s, in 
              fact since the NCHT was founded. Through the NCHT ISKCON have, along 
              with other groups, been in the position to have an influence on 
              national discussion about the future of Hindu traditions in Britain, 
              particularly on the institutional level (that is with regard to 
              the creation and maintenance of temples). The NCHT has already had 
              a fairly limited role for most Hindus in Britain as its role is 
              mainly as an advisory body providing a great deal of help and advice 
              to local groups of Hindus. At the same time, however, the NCHT have 
              occasionally taken a more political / pressure-group type role, 
              for example during December 1992 following the destruction of the 
              Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, India, the NCHT were involved in discussions 
              with Muslim organisations to try to resolve Hindu-Muslin tensions 
              in Britain. 
            <p>In 1994 a new national Hindu organisation was created-very much 
              with the blessing of the NCHT (and indeed with many of its personnel). 
              This was the Hindu Council of the UK (HCUK), whose role is to become 
              a mouthpiece for all Hindus in Britain, modelling itself to a degree 
              along the lines of the British Board of Deputies for the Jewish 
              population. Therefore, the HCUK has the potential to become a strong 
              lobbying organisation for the 500,000 Hindu population of Britain. 
              Again members of ISKCON were involved in planning for and launch 
              of the HCUK, and so if the latter succeeds in its objectives, then 
              so will ISKCON since they will be able to have a strong influence 
              on the future development of Hinduism in the UK at this national 
              level. 
            <p>It is important, however, to bear in mind that there remains a 
              great deal of heterogeneity within British Hindu groups and that 
              ISKCON is playing against other powerful groups who are also seeking 
              to shape the future direction of national movements such as the 
              NCHT and the HCUK. There are several large non-sectarian temples 
              that have a high measure of public support from both local and wider 
              communities. There are other sectarian groups with very different 
              approaches to ISKCON, in particular the Swaminarayan groups-the 
              International Swaminarayan Satsang Organisation (ISSO) and the Swaminarayan 
              Hindu Mission. There are also regional groups such as the Hindu 
              Council of the North and the Hindu Council of Brent, and caste based 
              groups such as the Patidar Samaj. Each of these groups has a different 
              agenda to ISKCON, and so of course will want to take the national 
              organisations in different directions to those proposed by ISKCON. 
            <p>The most important factor within the development of the relationship 
              between ISKCON and British Hindus at the national level has been 
              the campaign to prevent the closure of the temple at Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor, just outside London. Although this place was originally envisioned 
              by Prabhupada as a training centre for ISKCON <i>pujaris</i> (temple 
              'priests'), the temple accommodating the deities of Radha-Gokulananda 
              at the Manor soon became popular with the local Hindu population 
              living in north-west London. During the 1970s-beginning with the 
              deity installation ceremony in September 1973-increasing numbers 
              of Indian Hindus visited the temple for worship. It has been primarily 
              through this temple that most Indian Hindus have become devotees 
              and followers of ISKCON. But the passage of large numbers of worshippers 
              in cars through the village nearby (in some cases as many as 25,000 
              for the festival of Janmasthami) caused upset for the local (mainly 
              white middle-class) residents. 
            <p>I have documented elsewhere the long campaign that ISKCON fought 
              to prevent the closure of the Manor.<a href="#4">4</a> As is well 
              known, ISKCON was finally successful in 1996 when the Conservative 
              Secretary of State for the Environment, John Gummer, gave permission 
              for the construction of an access driveway which by-passed the local 
              village, plus full planning permission for the Manor to be used 
              as a place of public worship. One very significant reason for ISKCON's 
              success was, I believe, that the fight to 'save the temple' was 
              not just about ISKCON standing up for itself, it became an issue 
              for <i>all</i> Hindus in Britain. The NCHT and the HCUK were mobilised 
              to demonstrate their support for Bhaktivedanta Manor, the Gujarati 
              language British newspaper <i>Gujarat Samachar</i> campaigned to 
              raise the awareness of its Hindu readership of the need to protect 
              the Manor. A group called the 'Hare Krishna Temple Defence Movement' 
              campaigned vigorously among Hindu groups both to raise money to 
              help the campaign and to organise public demonstrations in support 
              of the Manor. 
            <p>Through these intense efforts many local Hindu temples took up 
              the campaign to save the temple, and to fight what they saw as a 
              threat to Hinduism in Britain. Many parties frequently emphasised 
              the fact that the Manor was 'the most important Hindu temple in 
              the UK', with the best facilities and standard of worship, and it 
              is also the only institution in Britain where Hindu priests are 
              formally trained. The campaign has certainly raised ISKCON's profile 
              and support among the general Hindu population- few Hindus in Britain 
              will now be unaware of ISKCON as a society and where they can be 
              found. The support for the Manor as a genuine and important Hindu 
              temple has made it very difficult for any Hindus to accuse ISKCON 
              of being outside the Hindu tradition. In sum, the campaign as it 
              was fought was a fight against an external force (British society, 
              indifference to Hinduism and most extremely, white racism), and 
              as such it has been a very effective means by which ISKCON has gained 
              the sympathy and support of Hindus. 
            <p><b>ISKCON and Hindus on a private level<br>
              </b>It is not enough, however, for ISKCON to gain a public profile 
              through these campaigns and these organisations. ISKCON's influence 
              among British Hindus also has to go down to the 'grass roots' level 
              of individual practitioners and believers if it is to make a difference 
              to the next generations of Hindus. For many years Hindus have been 
              visiting Bhaktivedanta Manor, talking to devotees, receiving ISKCON 
              literature and teachings. In many ways the freely available facilities 
              that ISKCON provide to Hindus (and any other interested visitors) 
              have helped to transform the ways in which many Hindus in Britain 
              practise their religion and are likely to have an ongoing influence. 
            <p>On the level of public worship, the worship at ISKCON temples is 
              of an extremely high standard. Because of the training facilities 
              at Bhaktivedanta Manor and the way in which ISKCON have a high number 
              of full-time followers (supported by ISKCON without any other work 
              commitments), there is a pool of well trained <i>pujaris</i> who 
              have the ability to serve the temple deities very well throughout 
              the day. Worship of this standard is certainly not available in 
              many other Hindu temples in Britain and so this is a strong advantage 
              for ISKCON and sets a standard of expectation which other temples 
              need to aspire to. 
            <p>However, the high quality of worship means more to individual devotees 
              than merely a comfortable and enjoyable visit to a temple. Consistent, 
              rigorous and efficient worship by the <i>pujaris</i> in the temple 
              has the result that the deities (<i>murtis</i>) are pleased, and 
              will be more likely to intervene in human affairs. In particular 
              the <i>murtis</i> of Radha-Gokulananda (Radha-Krishna), that are 
              the main focus on worship at the temple at Bhaktivedanta Manor, 
              are considered by many Hindus to be very powerful, and highly effective 
              if prayed to. There are some stories that Hindus have received blessings 
              and miracles from Radha-Gokulananda-for example a woman who had 
              previously been unable to conceive a child became pregnant when 
              she performed worship to Radha-Gokulananda at Bhaktivedanta Manor. 
              Such stories are not unusual for Hindu temple deities, but they 
              do serve to establish the significance of the deities at a particular 
              place, and in turn this helps to establish the place as a centre 
              for pilgrimage. 
            <p>This again has a knock-on effect on other Hindu temples-first it 
              shows that Hindu deities are very much present and active within 
              the British environment (if proof is needed), and secondly it helps 
              to further shift the emphasis of Hinduism from India to Britain. 
              Now it is not strictly necessary to go to India to perform a <i>tirtha-yatra</i> 
              (pilgrimage). Although the main centres for Hindu pilgrimage still 
              remain on the Indian sub-continent, sites are developing in the 
              UK-such as Bhaktivedanta Manor- where effective pilgrimage can be 
              undertaken. 
            <p>To return to my questionnaire, however, it is interesting to note 
              that for most Hindus in Britain the idea of pilgrimage is something 
              which is done outside of Britain. I asked two questions about this 
              subject: 'what places / temples have you been on pilgrimage to?' 
              and 'which place / temple would you most like to make a pilgrimage 
              to'? All the responses I have received so far have been from people 
              living in the London area and from them by far the majority of responses 
              have mentioned India as the place they have visited or would like 
              to visit for pilgrimage. One respondent listed 'Luton, Coventry, 
              Leicester, India' as the places where he had been on pilgrimage, 
              and only one specifically mentioned Bhaktivedanta Manor, saying 
              'because it is so peaceful, no restriction in what you wear or how 
              you pray etc.'. On the whole, however, there are many Hindus going 
              to Bhaktivedanta Manor, but no so many of them describe it particularly 
              as a place of pilgrimage. 
            <p>ISKCON is also making a very important contribution to the development 
              of Hinduism in Britain through the process of education-both through 
              its literature and through the teaching abilities of its devotees. 
              Through its teaching programmes it can present a systematic and 
              highly comprehensible representation of Hinduism-not only to other 
              Hindus, but also to outsiders. This is not always a feat that is 
              easily achieved, and some may feel that to present Hinduism so systematically 
              is to actually <i>mis</i>-represent the complexity of Hindu traditions. 
              But nonetheless the ability of ISKCON teachers and educationalists 
              to communicate their religious tradition is well respected by many 
              Hindus- especially those who are struggling to teach their children 
              about Hinduism.<a href="#5">5</a> 
            <p> Since around 1994 ISKCON has also been strongly involved in generating 
              inter-faith dialogue with other major religious groups in Britain-particularly 
              Christians. In September 1994 a conference was held at Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor to explore experiences of god between ISKCON devotees, church 
              professionals and other interested parties<a href="#6">6</a> and 
              further such conferences have followed.<a href="#7">7</a> ISKCON 
              has indeed been involved with inter-faith groups (particularly the 
              national Inter-Faith Network) for many years, and has received support 
              from the Inter-Faith Network for their campaign to keep Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor open. But the organisation of these conferences to encourage 
              dialogue suggests a new attempt to shape outsiders' perceptions 
              of Hinduism- particularly the Vaishnavism of ISKCON-through dialogue 
              with leading members of other faith groups. 
            <p>On a more immediate level, however, ISKCON also has a ready-made 
              medium through which to communicate that message to young British 
              Hindus. As the answers to my questionnaire indicated earlier, in 
              Britain there are an ever growing number of Hindu children who are 
              not proficient in their 'mother tongue' (whether it be Hindi, Gujarati 
              or some other language). To some degree, therefore, religious ideas 
              have to be translated for them, and the transmission of the religion 
              to the next generation is heavily dependent on the way in which 
              the translation is made, if at all.<a href="#8">8</a> For ISKCON, 
              though, the process of translation began long ago, with the advent 
              of Krishna Consciousness in the west. One of Prabhupada's gifts 
              was as a translator-he saw his mission as bringing the message of 
              Krishna into the medium of English, and hence to the English-speaking 
              world (of course, his own guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati had encouraged 
              him to do this in 1922). This means that when young British Hindus 
              of Indian ancestry go to ISKCON temples, the devotees and teachers 
              that they find there literally speak their language and can talk 
              to them in depth about their religion in English. Furthermore, the 
              ISKCON devotees are ready and able to explain the complexities of 
              their philosophy in a medium that the young Hindus are able to understand. 
              This in itself is an advantage for ISKCON, since not only is the 
              provision of explanations for Hindu religious ideas not usually 
              found in Hindu temples, such explanations are heavily in demand 
              by young Hindus who have been educated to expect to have answers 
              to their questions about their religion. 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>The appeal of ISKCON for many British Hindus is obviously strong. 
              However, it is by no means universal, and it is not likely that 
              ISKCON will become the dominant form of Hinduism in Britain (either 
              in the short or the long term). But the development of Hinduism 
              in Britain has been-and will most probably continue to be-extremely 
              fluid, with innovation and reinvention of traditions taking the 
              various expressions of Hinduism in new directions which are specific 
              to the British context. As a traditional and yet innovative form 
              of Hinduism, ISKCON is well placed to take a leading role in shaping 
              some aspects of the forms of Hinduism that will emerge in this country 
              over the next generations, and they have already shown an ability 
              and willingness to reach out and be influential in this way. 
            <p>One final key advantage that ISKCON has in this situation is that 
              theirs is an outlook and a history which addresses one of the major 
              issues that all British Hindus have to face-that is, bridging the 
              gap between the Indian culture from which their experiences are 
              derived, and the western culture in which are they are very much 
              enmeshed. ISKCON can be of some help here, since the movement has 
              done some of the hard work in this renegotiation already. Prabhupada 
              himself tried to bridge the gap between traditional Indian Hinduism 
              and western cultures. The history of ISKCON as a westerner's form 
              of Hinduism-with many of its devotees coming from western cultural 
              backgrounds-places it at a similar interface as that experienced 
              by the majority of Hindus in Britain. In this sense, Prabhupada 
              and the early devotees have provided some paradigms and perhaps 
              a few answers for the new Indian / Hindu Krishna devotees (although 
              coming at the experience from a rather different angle). ISKCON 
              is providing devotees with a form of Hinduism that is definitely 
              designed for the west-in a way, it could be called a western form 
              of Hinduism-which is still most definitely rooted in the Hindu tradition. 
              This puts ISKCON in a very good place to succeed as a major influence 
              in the development of the emerging forms of Hinduism in Britain. 
              And it is quite likely-notwithstanding the pessimistic prognoses 
              of many British Hindus-that the religion will continue and develop 
              within its new context.
