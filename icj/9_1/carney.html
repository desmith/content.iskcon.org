            <p>These annual two-day meetings have been sponsored by ISKCON Communications 
              and by the Office of Inter-religious Relations of the National Conference 
              of Catholic Bishops (NCCB). The large meeting room at the conference 
              centre has been rearranged with three areas: for food, for discussion, 
              for worship. These meetings begin early Friday afternoon with presentations 
              by Christian and Vaisnava scholars. That leaves at least three hours 
              of discussion prior to dinner. After dinner, there is an informal 
              sharing of religious music and song. </p>
            <p>After breakfast, the Saturday morning programme begins with a sharing 
              of the variety of forms of prayer that are practised in each tradition. 
              From the Vaisnava side we have devotional songs, <i>kirtana</i>, 
              <i>arati</i>, and commentary on the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>or the 
              <i>Bhagavata Purana. </i>From the Christians we have hymns, Morning 
              Prayer, reading from the Bible, and preaching on the reading. The 
              discussion time after the prayer - about ninety minutes - has formulated 
              responses to the prayer as well as a continuation of the conversation 
              from the previous day. We have always been blessed with good spring 
              weather on Saturday and have enjoyed the grounds of the conference 
              centre during the lunch break. There is a final ninety-minute block 
              of time for discussion after lunch before the participants devote 
              the final hour of the meeting to planning for the following year. 
              The work of the group was co-directed by Anuttama Dasa (ISKCON Communications) 
              and by John Borelli (NCCB). </p>
            <p>The first two meetings (1998 and 1999) of the dialogue had been 
              devoted to the theme 'Spirit in the World' with assigned readings 
              chosen from the Vaisnava and Christian scrip-tures. The 2000 meeting 
              of this dialogue had been focused on reading the fundamental scriptural 
              texts of our traditions so that we could share a deeper appreciation 
              of each other's traditions. We examined selected texts from the 
              Gospel of John and <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. </p>
            <p>This year we had decided to read two classical, but not scriptural, 
              texts on growth in religious life: Saint Bonaventure's <i>The Soul's 
              Journey to God </i>and Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti's <i>Madhurya-kadambini 
              </i>(<i>Cloud Bank of Nectar</i>). Both texts were introduced by 
              a representative from the Vaisnava and Christian participants. </p>
            <p>James Wiseman, a Benedictine monk and president of the Monastic 
              Inter-religious Dialogue, showed how Bonaventure's thirteenth-century 
              work illustrated the soul's journey deeper into God, emphasising 
              the importance of human emotions and the world in bringing about 
              intimacy with God: from vestiges of God's presence in the universe 
              and human mind, through the image of God formed to clear likeness 
              in faith, hope, and love, to understanding God as the source of 
              Being and Goodness, and, finally, to abiding in God beyond the capacity 
              of intellect. He suggested links with the <i>Madhurya-kadambini 
              </i>as stressing the primacy of the <i>bhakti </i>path and the Lord's 
              grace, as love itself inspires more love, and as it finds expression 
              in <i>prema </i>and in the spiritual intoxication of the devotee. 
            </p>
            <p>Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, a member of the Governing Body Commission 
              of ISKCON, emphasised that the eighteenth-century <i>Madhurya-kadambini</i>, 
              like <i>The Soul's Journey </i>five centuries before, presumes a 
              life of devotional practice, which in the Vaisnava case comes about 
              through the chanting of the divine name. He proposed ten points 
              of encounter between the two works: the single-minded intensity 
              of purpose that they presuppose; the necessity of devotional cultivation 
              through prayer and discipline; the requirement of pro-gressive purification 
              of heart; the attainment of illumination; the perception of God 
              in all things, seeing the world - all things - as God's form; movement 
              toward participation in higher forms of God's presence, until one 
              knows and loves everything in God, develops the spiritual senses 
              to understand God; and, finally, to participate in the divine life. 
              He sug-gested that there were more possible links between Bonaventure's 
              understanding of creation and a Vaisnava sense of divine emanations. 
              Both presentations showed the wisdom of choosing two texts that 
              dealt specifically with the spiritual path and the development of 
              the devotee. In the concrete description of the journey into God 
              and the cultivation of <i>bhakti </i>they represented significant 
              steps beyond abstract doctrinal statements and provided very evocative 
              questions for further discussion. </p>
            <p>Throughout the periods left for discussion we focused on issues 
              that seemed to underlie the practical experience of religious life 
              in our diverse traditions: concern over the treat-ment of evil, 
              the role of passion as a path to God, the place of divine embodiment 
              as essential for spiritual advancement, and the relation between 
              the spiritual body in the Vaisnava thought and the resurrected body 
              in the Christian. </p>
            <p>The period of shared prayer from both traditions on Saturday morning 
              placed us and our theological discussion in proper context. We returned 
              to discussing the stages of spiritual development as it is understood 
              in our two traditions, particularly the hierarchical process of 
              advancement on the path, and the relation between <i>vaidhi-bhakti 
              </i>and Bonaventure's sense of the 'sacramentality of the created 
              order' as they contribute to spiritual development. Finally, we 
              discussed how the dynamism of God's presence is the foundation for 
              all spiritual growth, and how the fullness of God comes to be shared 
              by those who love God, as one tastes a relationship with God and 
              savours the sweetness of God's name. As we talked, our concern passed 
              from the texts themselves to an informal application to our experiences 
              - similar and different - of the spiritual journey into the life 
              of God. </p>
            <p>Several of the strengths of this dialogue process became clear: 
              the very high level of commitment of the participants, most of whom 
              were returning for three or more years; the experience of many participants 
              in both the Christian and Vaisnava traditions; the priority of shared 
              prayer as the context for dialogue; and the high level of trust 
              that has been generated among the participants that leads to serious 
              sharing about our religious paths - we now speak neither from books 
              nor from our heads alone but heart to heart. </p>
            <p>Once again we had sumptuous meals prepared by members of the Potomac 
              ISKCON community. For me it was reminiscent of festival meals in 
              Vraja when it was necessary to fend off the efforts of those serving 
              the food to pile more and more onto the plate. The food and the 
              atmosphere of the grounds provided a perfect accompaniment to our 
              conversa-tions. </p>
            <p>Before leaving, we reflected on the goals that had been fulfilled 
              in our work thus far: we have moved beyond tolerance to a level 
              of rapport, a deeper understanding of self through the other; we 
              have experienced change at the affective level in our appreciation 
              of our traditions and, more importantly, each other; we enjoyed 
              the retreat atmosphere and the time for prayer, the enthusiastic 
              participation of one and all, and, simply, the fun of coming together. 
              We considered several ways of continuing this sharing of classical 
              texts on the religious life and decided to devote the 2002 meeting 
              of the dialogue to discussing Bernard of Clairvaux's treatise <i>On 
              the Love of God </i>and selections from the <i>Narada-bhakti-sutra</i>. 
              Our journey together, well begun, continues. </p>
