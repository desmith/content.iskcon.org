            <p align="left"><i>In her presentation and in this paper Norma McCaig 
              posits a framework for examining and understanding cultural challenges 
              facing devotee youth and their parents. She points out that, although 
              they inhabit the same ISKCON culture, they are coming into that 
              culture from different angles; they are either immigrants or natives, 
              they are there by choice or birth. This difference in origins, and 
              the different perceptions that these give rise to, leads to further 
              differences in blending with external cultures. This paper shows 
              one way of understanding the relationships between the generations. 
              Development of this understanding is vital if ISKCON is to develop 
              a stable base of devotee families. </i></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
            <p>Having spent a portion of my youth in the Palni Hills of Tamil 
              Nadu, I was delighted to be present at the Vaisnava Family and Youth 
              Conference, surrounded by elements of a culture I hold dear. The 
              willingness of the ISKCON community to explore the impact of devotee 
              life on family dynamics is impressive. You are addressing difficult 
              issues with openness and courage and stand only to benefit from 
              such honest inquiry. </p>
            <p>In this paper I provide a framework for discussion of family cultural 
              issues as they affect the children of devotees. This structure is 
              based on work I have done with global nomads, persons who, like 
              myself, have been raised internationally because of a parent's career 
              choice and have experienced numerous cross-cultural transitions. 
              Global nomads and children of devotees share similar experiences 
              of cultural transition and marginalisation when entering the culture 
              of their 'home' countries. I am here because my work meets your 
              community's experience where your children meet the culture of the 
              outside world. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><strong>Overview </strong></p>
            <p>Four areas are to be addressed in the scope of this paper: </p>
            <p>(1) An overview of relevant terms used in the intercultural field 
              and for this paper. </p>
            <p>(2) An exploration of how ISKCON's parents and children develop 
              culturally (and differently). </p>
            <p>(3) What the implications are of high mobility, transitions and 
              intercultural interaction for Krsna youth relating to one another, 
              the ISKCON community and the outside world. </p>
            <p>(4) What might be done to guide and support them. </p>
            <p>Four second-generation panellists, Yudhisthira Dasa, Jahnavi Devi 
              Dasi (of Children of Krishna), Amrta Dasi, and Prajyumna Kafle, 
              joined me in the presentation from which this paper is drawn. References 
              are made to their comments throughout this document. I would refer 
              you as well to papers presented by Yudhisthira Dasa and Prajyumna 
              Kafle for powerfully eloquent reflections and suggestions borne 
              of their own experiences. </p>
            <p>An important note: many aspects of adjustment to the outside world 
              are similar for both parents and children. As a result, many first-generation 
              devotees will find resonance with much that follows. It is at such 
              points of intersection that you will be able to come alongside your 
              children to support them. However, it is important to do so with 
              keen awareness of the differences in your experiences - and the 
              notion that, as Jahnavi said at the conference, your child's responses 
              and conclusions may differ, therefore, from your own. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><strong>Relevant terminology </strong></p>
            <p>Many of you may have read the excellent book <i>The Third Culture 
              Kid Experience: Growing Up Among Worlds</i>, by Ruth Van Reken and 
              David C. Pollock, that has resonated so power-fully with a number 
              of second-generation Hare Krsna youth. The insights therein provided 
              the impetus to hold this session at the Vaisnava Family and Youth 
              Conference. </p>
            <p>The term 'third-culture kid' was originally coined in the 1960s 
              by sociologist Dr Ruth Hill Useem. It is this original definition 
              that I will use in this paper. Dr Useem defined third-culture kids 
              as persons who, as children, accompany parents on foreign assignments 
              due to a parent's 'certain specific sponsored role such as business, 
              foreign service, military, missionary or other categories where 
              he/she assumed a representative rather than solely an individual 
              role'. (Useem and Useem 1963) (Useem R. 1976)' (Jordan, p. 10). 
            </p>
            <p>A global nomad is someone who has lived abroad as a child because 
              of a parent's career choice. (McCaig 1996). </p>
            <p>The two terms are very nearly synonymous. Global nomad is a little 
              broader, as it includes not only those whose parents are sponsored 
              abroad by 'the church, the company or the flag' but also those whose 
              parents work abroad independently, such as the jazz musician who 
              bases his family in Europe while he plays concerts in that region. 
            </p>
            <p>Both terms, global nomad and third-culture kid, are useful in defining 
              this specific cultural community whose members are linked through 
              the circumstances of their internationally mobile upbringing. Some 
              ISKCON youth are more comfortable using one term or the other to 
              describe themselves. Many use them interchangeably. What speaks 
              to both groups is the description that follows. In this case it 
              comes on the heels of the global nomad definition: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>As a result of their internationally-mobile upbringing, many 
                feel <i>simultaneously </i>part-of and apart-from all countries 
                in which they live, including their country of passport, often 
                having a greater sense of the wholeness of common culture with 
                others who share their global nomad heritage. (McCaig, 1998) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This also describes most ISKCON youth who have never left their 
              country's borders, but have experienced cultural discomfort in adjusting 
              to the outside world. The difference between their experience and 
              that of the global nomad/third-culture kid is largely one of degree. 
            </p>
            <p>To comment about the importance of terminology on a personal, rather 
              than academic level, having one's experience 'named' in a way that 
              feels true to the core of one's being is like finally coming home 
              to oneself after a long journey to nowhere. The sense of cultural 
              affirmation that comes with this can be almost overwhelming. This 
              positive naming of a shared heritage ascribes normalcy and worth 
              to the experience. </p>
            <p>The terms 'global nomad' and 'third-culture kid' have done this 
              for several generations of internationally-raised individuals. ISKCON 
              itself seems to be on the cusp of 'naming consciousness', as cultures 
              within it - particularly that of Krsna youth - seek the affirmation 
              of definition. While centring one's self in Krsna is the ultimate 
              goal, this naming process provides additional clarity for devotees 
              and their children as they move through life. </p>
            <p>In the course of this paper, several new definitions or descriptors 
              are used to distinguish between different cultural experiences within 
              the ISKCON community. </p>
            <p>It is my hope that members of the ISKCON community will find the 
              same sense of cultural resonance, validation and identity in these 
              new terms that many global nomads and third-culture kids have found 
              in claiming these descriptors as their own. </p>
            <p>Now let's explore how the ISKCON culture has shaped different generations 
              of devotees and their children. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Family acculturation and continua of cultural 
              identity </p>
            <p>As common knowledge has it, first-generation devotees typically 
              grew up in the outside world and chose to join the Hare Krsna movement 
              through Prabhupada as young adults. Within their country's borders, 
              devotees then entered the enclosed, self-sufficient ISKCON communities 
              essentially as spiritual and cultural émigrés. Because these early 
              first-generation devotees chose the ISKCON mainstream values and 
              culture after childhood, they are referred to as 'Krsna-culture 
              adults' in this paper. </p>
            <p>These Krsna-culture adults maintained little communication with 
              the material world in their countries and generally held no thought 
              of ever returning permanently to it. Their culture of origin was 
              consciously and intentionally left behind as they willingly assimilated 
              into their culture of choice, the ISKCON culture. The values and 
              traditions of their adopted culture were (and still are, of course) 
              closely related to the more traditional mainstream values of India 
              as evidenced by the community's use of Indian words, gestures, customs, 
              dress, and foods, as well as Vaisnava spiritual philosophy. </p>
            <p>For devotees who are not from India, elements of their culture 
              of birth generally remained through the idioms, facial gestures, 
              and body language that are a part of any culture's verbal and nonverbal 
              communication. These became blended with the Indian influence, to 
              form each country's unique ISKCON culture (see Figure 1, overleaf). 
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Figure 1. Continuum of Krsna-culture adult 
              identity</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><img src="../../images/icj/mccaig1.gif" width="361" height="360"> 
            </p>
            <p>(This graphic, and all others in this paper, uses population bell 
              curves to describe identity. They are meant to illustrate concepts 
              and are not based on specific research data. ) </p>
            <p>The Krsna-culture adults' culture of choice is, however, their 
              children's culture of origin, their core culture (see Figure 2). 
              Life according to ISKCON was the only life most devotee children 
              knew growing up. This was particularly true for the older members 
              of the second-generation, whose contact with the wider world during 
              childhood was more limited than today's ISKCON youth. </p>
            <p>Regardless of age or nationality, these children of devotees share 
              a common culture as 'Krsna-culture kids'. This fact shapes who they 
              are and speaks to why they are - and always will be - culturally 
              different from their Krsna-culture parents. Once a Krsna-culture 
              kid, always a Krsna-culture kid. This is not a phase; it is a lifelong 
              identity marker of benefits and challenges that inform the Krsna-culture 
              kid's decisions throughout life, just as the childhood experiences 
              of first-generation devotees have had an impact on the decision 
              of each to seek Krsna consciousness through ISKCON. Obviously, it 
              is also why Krsna-culture kids are so different from mainstream 
              culture youth in their respective countries.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"> Figure 2. The second-generation Krsna-culture 
              kid cultural identity continuum</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><img src="../../images/icj/mccaig2.gif" width="361" height="360"></p>
            <p>There is one important distinction between the Krsna-culture adult 
              and the Krsna-culture kid experience. Krsna-culture adults willingly 
              moved to the edge of their country's culture to become marginal 
              individuals there. Their children, on the other hand, were born 
              into that marginality or received it during highly developmental 
              years. Yudhisthira Dasa, who grew up in the movement, both domestically 
              and internationally, said in his opening remarks at the Vaisnava 
              Family and Youth Conference: 'It wasn't until I was in college that 
              I finally stopped being afraid of being a Hare Krsna, of being different'. 
            </p>
            <p>For many Krsna-culture adults, the mainstream cultural values of 
              the community have also been shifting as a result of events in ISKCON's 
              history, leading, in a sense, to forced migration back into the 
              outside world to live and work. It is their children, the second-generation 
              young adults, largely born into the movement, <i>gurukula</i>-schooled 
              and with minimal lived experience in the outside world, who find 
              themselves balancing on the roughest edge where ISKCON culture meets 
              the wider world. Younger Krsna-culture kids, whose interac-tion 
              with the outside culture is more commonplace from an earlier age, 
              are, on the other hand, raised more bi-culturally than are their 
              older siblings. As such, their transition into the outside world 
              as young adults may well be less abrupt.</p>
            <p> In 1928, sociologist Robert E. Park defined his marginal man as 
              'a cultural hybrid, [one] who is living and sharing intimately in 
              the cultural life and traditions of two distinct peoples, never 
              quite willing to break, even if permitted to do so, with his past 
              and his traditions, and not quite accepted, because of prejudice, 
              in the new society in which he now [seeks] to find a place. He [is] 
              a man on the margin of two cultures and two societies which never 
              completely [interpenetrate and fuse]' (Park, p. 892). It is here, 
              in the internalised aspects of life lived on the margins of different 
              cultures, that the experience of Park's marginal man intersects 
              with that of both Krsna-culture adults and Krsna-culture kids. </p>
            <p>Some Krsna-culture kids have yet another significant cultural overlay 
              to their lives - the experience of living with their parents in 
              another country, or perhaps several countries, either as expatriates 
              sponsored by ISKCON or under other auspices. Through the internationally 
              mobile experience they become third-culture Krsna kids (third-culture 
              kids), part of the worldwide cultural community of third-culture 
              kids/global nomads mentioned earlier. Figure 3 illustrates the cultural 
              identity continuum of that community.</p>

            <p>Again, this community includes the sons and daughters of diplomats, 
              international business executives, United Nations employees, overseas 
              military personnel, and missionaries, to name a few sponsoring communities. 
              They are known as 'missionary kids', 'business kids', 'military 
              brats' (for dependents of service men and women in the Armed Forces), 
              'suitcase children' (for Finnish global nomads) and, now, 'third-culture 
              Krsna kids'.</p>
            <p> Figure 4 illustrates the third-culture kid's cultural identity 
              continuum. In this model, culture B is just one other country of 
              residence abroad. For some third-culture kids, time lived in several 
              countries during childhood adds more layers to their cultural identity.</p>

              identity continuum </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><img src="../../images/icj/mccaig4.gif" width="356" height="311"></p>
            <p>Third-culture kids are exposed to even greater complexities of 
              culture that may include major unexpected differences in language, 
              customs, food, basic daily amenities - the list can go on and on 
              - as they explore and adjust to at least three cultures simultaneously 
              in each country of residence outside their home country: </p>
            <p>(1) The ISKCON community culture in the host country, </p>
            <p>(2) the host country outside culture, and,</p>
            <p> (3) the expatriate community culture. </p>
            <p>For younger third-culture kids educated outside the <i>gurukula 
              </i>system, this could include adjusting to either a host country 
              school or to an international school and perhaps needing to learn 
              a new language.</p>
            <p> For all Krsna-culture kids, adjustment to the outside world requires 
              cross-cultural awareness and intercultural communication skills, 
              even within the borders of their own nations. The third-culture 
              kids' adjustment process and core value system is usually affected 
              in part by the complexity of adjusting to international relocations 
              into multiple cultures, each of which may be radically different 
              from the rest. </p>
            <p>Encouraging discussion about the similarities and differences between 
              the Krsna-culture kid and third-culture kid experiences - and ways 
              they affect perceptions - would be useful for both groups. It is 
              critically important for those considering marriage to share how 
              each views the outside world - how to relate to it, where to live, 
              and how children need to be raised. The effect of national culture, 
              ISKCON culture and, where relevant, third-culture-kid culture on 
              each partner - especially in intercultural marriages - needs to 
              be con-sidered, as all can affect the dynamics of daily married 
              life in ways not initially apparent. </p>
            <p>Finally, and importantly, each of these diagrams is presented as 
              a continuum for good reason. The bell shape in each diagram sends 
              the message that it is impossible to stereotype those in any of 
              the systems represented. Not all members of each system align themselves 
              totally with the core values of that system at the centre of the 
              bell curve. Wide variation may exist. Within ISKCON itself, clearly 
              some members are committed to traditional public expression of faith 
              through dress, for example. Others choose to express their faith 
              more pri-vately, perhaps as an adaptation to the realities of bridging 
              the gap between ISKCON and the outside world. Their position on 
              the curve would perhaps be moving toward the national culture. In 
              addition, throughout one's life, where one would place oneself relative 
              to the values of one's primary cultural system often varies according 
              to circumstance. </p>
            <p>Using these continua as a starting point for discussion can be 
              valuable in developing awareness and understanding of others, both 
              in ISKCON and the community beyond. Focused discussions can be especially 
              helpful as a means for spouses, friends, parents and their children 
              - grown and growing - to share feelings, attitudes and opinions 
              to foster better communication. Where would they put themselves 
              on the continuum? What does being Krsna conscious mean to each? 
              What impact has the community had on each? How would each express 
              the values of the majority of the community and their own in relation 
              to it? How are these values expressed in daily life or in life planning? 
              What are the benefits and challenges they bring? How can each family 
              member support the other in balancing more than one culture, living 
              in more than one culture? </p>
            <p>In confirming whether or not their assumptions about each other 
              are correct and by opening the door to further dialogue, parents 
              can affirm and support their children during their growing years 
              and the transition into adulthood. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Implications of high mobility, transitions 
              and intercultural interaction </p>
            <p><i>High mobility </i></p>
            <p>It is common for Krsna youth to relocate several times with their 
              parents; such relocations can be either to other parts of their 
              home country or other parts of the world. For some, the benefits 
              that come with frequent moves might include a healthy sense of adventure. 
              You know you're a Krsna-culture kid or third-culture kid when, as 
              Yudhisthira said, 'Just watching the travel channel makes you itchy'. 
              Along with this might come the willingness to take risks and change, 
              and a high degree of independence. On the other hand, some feel 
              in themselves a built-in migratory instinct that can result in change 
              for the sake of change, and a sense of restlessness and rootlessness 
              that is disquieting to the soul. </p>
            <p>Perhaps the greatest impact of high mobility revolves around issues 
              of commitment and belonging. Many who move may show hesitancy in 
              making any sort of commitment - relationships, employment, putting 
              down roots. They may quickly move on emotionally, professionally 
              and geographically. In addition, many have difficulty making decisions 
              and developing long-term plans. If a Krsna-culture kid has moved 
              every two to three years during childhood, a five- or ten-year plan 
              may be difficult to envision. This may be related in part to the 
              child's sense of powerlessness, as alluded to earlier. Children 
              have little or no voice in matters involving where they will live 
              and with whom. This may be particularly relevant to youth who lived 
              apart from their parents in <i>gurukulas</i>. As Jahnavi Devi Dasi 
              described it: 'Kids may think parents are thinking more of themselves 
              and may feel betrayed, unable to trust what priority [they] have 
              in their parent's lives'. She went on to say that this is where, 
              for the child, the parents' commitment to the philosophy of detachment 
              can backfire. You become so attached to what you didn't have - love 
              and commitment - and at the same time you don't know how to commit'. 
            </p>
            <p>Another critical factor for children who move often is the sense 
              of loss that comes with each uprooting and replanting. In his presentations, 
              David Pollock expresses this with brief eloquence: 'Hellos are awkward; 
              goodbyes are painful'. With enough successive goodbyes, the 'certainty' 
              of hurt seems inevitable. The child, and later the adult, may grow 
              protective </p>
            <p>and wary of connecting with others with any degree of emotional 
              intimacy. In his presentation, Prajyumna used a metaphor to describe 
              powerful feelings related to these partings: 'You're like a prostitute 
              who cuts off feelings because you can't give your heart'. Understanding 
              the power of loss, allowing the child to express feelings of sadness, 
              to honour the value of who and what is left behind, and to have 
              enough time to say goodbye to, as Pollock says, places, people and 
              pets are ways to help children cope with leave taking. When the 
              grief process is allowed to flow and move to resolution, turning 
              toward the new home can be done with perhaps a greater sense of 
              excitement and anticipation. </p>
            <p>During the presentation, Prajyumna, who lived in several countries, 
              shared the metaphor of forensics as a suitable one for the Krsna-culture 
              kid and third-culture kid experience when he said: 'When you enter 
              into an environment, you leave pieces of yourself, and you pick 
              up aspects of the environment you leave', echoing Tennyson's, 'I 
              am a part of all that I have met'. Each changes the other; nothing 
              remains the same. Touching on the benefits and challenges of high 
              mobility, Prajyumna went on to say: 'The global nomad child is doing 
              that all over the planet, so to comprehend who you are, where you 
              belong, [involves] a lot of confusion. But when you address all 
              that confusion and you understand who you are and you can see yourself 
              in full depth, then you're a much richer personality than somebody 
              who has only come to the conclusion about their [identity] from 
              one environment'. </p>
            <p>Moving, domestically or internationally, can add layers of experience 
              and perspectives that last a lifetime. Youth who have done so often 
              develop good social skills in the process of reconnecting in new 
              places and working through the process of fitting in with the new 
              environment. Like cultural chameleons, they take on the some of 
              the colouration of their surroundings, adapting to the ways of those 
              around them. Krsna-culture kids understand this process unconsciously, 
              and the ability to adjust is part of the Krsna-culture kids' understanding 
              of who they are. For Yudhisthira, for example, encountering the 
              cultural chameleon image brought a revelation of its own. 'I thought 
              I was shy', he said. 'Now I realise I was just observing'. As it 
              turns out, this skill of observation, learned by youth as a coping 
              strategy when moving from place to place, can benefit Krsna-culture 
              kids in any number of ways later in adulthood - particularly in 
              professions involving mediation, negotiation and accurate reporting, 
              to name a few. </p>
            <p><i>Transition </i></p>
            <p>Moving can challenge anyone's sensibilities because one is adjusting 
              at several levels simultaneously. After an initial period of fascination 
              and exhilaration about being in a new place, reality sets in. One 
              of the reasons the relocation experience is so powerful is that 
              it requires adjustment on six and sometimes seven different levels 
              - often several simultaneously: </p>
            <p>(1) Practically - finding housing, shopping, learning about the 
              new location; </p>
            <p>(2) Socially - making friends, establishing networks within ISKCON 
              and otherwise; </p>
            <p>(3) Culturally - learning the customs and habits of the new area; 
            </p>
            <p>(4) Professionally, vocationally or educationally - adjusting to 
              new surroundings; </p>
            <p>(5) Emotionally - dealing with homesickness or the stress of the 
              move; </p>
            <p>(6) Physically - adjusting to new sights, sounds, smells, climate, 
              and foods; </p>
            <p>(7) Spiritually - the change may strengthen or challenge faith. 
            </p>
            <p>As a result, every member of the family, young and old, experiences 
              culture shock when adjusting to the new environment. Changes in 
              mood, reactions to the discomfort of change - culture fatigue - 
              are normal. Awareness of the process can encourage parents to develop 
              strategies both for preventing some of the stress and for dealing 
              with it as it occurs. </p>
            <p><i>Intercultural Interaction </i></p>
            <p>For Krsna-culture kids, when the change involves greater interaction 
              with the outside world, the impact at each level mentioned above 
              is magnified by the overriding difference between cultures. This 
              has been particularly true for second-generation Krsna-culture kids 
              who are moving beyond the confines of the ISKCON community upbringing 
              into the real-ity of daily life on their own in the mainstream culture. 
              Jahnavi, for example, 'had no idea of the outside world' until she 
              was thirteen. She spoke of her shock and disgust when at that age 
              she saw the suggestive dancing of female singers on stage. Others 
              experience confusion or have strong reactions when sitting next 
              to someone in a cafeteria wolfing down a steak; facing the profanity 
              and near public nudity that the outside world takes for granted; 
              deciding how, when, and if his or her identity as a Hare Krsna should 
              be revealed; learning the rules of friendship, classroom behaviour, 
              and workplace behaviour; trying to comprehend the rules of male/female 
              interaction and dating; making decisions about how much or how little 
              to change behaviour while still staying true to oneself. The intercultural 
              dimensions of this transition are extremely challenging. That they 
              are being discussed more openly now can only be good for all Krsna-culture 
              kids, present and future. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
            <p>Panellists in the session were clear about ways parents and the 
              community can help their children. Giving Krsna-culture kids a sense 
              of their own community is important. One of the greatest benefits 
              of ISKCON is the heritage given to its youth. As one panellist said, 
              'If you have a devotee identity, you can depend on it for internal 
              security'. </p>
            <p>Jahnavi Devi Dasi observed: 'Kids need to hear where their parents 
              were coming from in becoming devotees'. Her final words to parents 
              were, 'Understand that the kids had no choice, give them room, and 
              don't judge'. </p>
            <p>The dialogue continues in person and via the Internet as Krsna-culture 
              kids - youth and young adults alike - exchange impressions of their 
              unique upbringing and how they face the future. The community itself 
              can extend the dialogue further so that the wisdom borne of discussion 
              can be passed on to the next generation of parents and youth. It 
              is an ongoing process for all. In the words of T. S. Eliot: </p>
