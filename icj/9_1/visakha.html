            <blockquote> 
              <p>I am not a <i>brahmana, </i>I am not a <i>ksatriya, </i>I am 
                not a <i>vaisya </i>or a <i>sudra</i>. Nor am I a <i>brahmacari, 
                </i>a householder, a <i>vanaprastha </i>or a <i>sannyasi</i>. 
                I identify Myself only as the servant of the servant of the servant 
                of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, the maintainer of the <i>gopis</i>. 
                (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Madhya-lila, 13.80) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Although each of us must carefully follow the particular principles 
              of the role we are playing in society - whether as a wife or husband, 
              a <i>brahmacari </i>or <i>sannyasi </i>- our true identity is that 
              we are the eternal servants of the servants of the devotees of Lord 
              Sri Krsna. By playing our present-day role in the proper consciousness, 
              we can realise our original identity - who we actually are - and 
              rejoin Krsna in His home. Krsna says, 'By worship of the Lord, who 
              is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, one can attain 
              perfection through performing one's own work'. (<i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>18.46) </p>
            <p>To be a husband or a wife is, in Srila Prabhupada's words, 'actually 
              a duty performed in mutual cooperation as directed in the authoritative 
              scriptures for spiritual advancement. Therefore marriage is essential 
              in order to avoid the life of cats and dogs, who are not meant for 
              spiritual enlightenment'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>3.14.19) We 
              accept the role of husband or wife so that we can gradually become 
              the best devotee we are capable of being. The first and overriding 
              principle in the husband-wife relationship is the unrelenting desire 
              of both individuals to make their marriage work through Krsna consciousness. 
              If that desire is in place, then there are scores of books and discussions, 
              counsellors, scriptural directions and the Lord in the heart to 
              help. For now, based on Srila Prabhupada's teachings, let us briefly 
              look at six items that can hamper one's service as a husband or 
              a wife. Then we will look at six items that can enhance that service. 
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">What makes it rough </p>
            <p><i>(1) Weakness of character </i></p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada writes: 'When a young boy or girl sees a member 
              of the opposite sex there is a natural attraction without the need 
              for any introduction. Without any training there is a natural attraction 
              due to the sex impulse'. (<i>Nectar of Devotion</i>, p. 81) Prior 
              to marriage, this natural attraction for the company of the opposite 
              sex may lead to flirting, dating, and dallying in coyness and sexual 
              innuendos. Such casual premarital relationships deny young men and 
              women the fortitude that celibacy in mind, word and deed creates; 
              deny the magnificence of carefree sailing over choppy waves of unnecessary 
              indulgences; and deny a sense of completion to one's formative years. 
            </p>
            <p>By such indulgence, material tendencies expand, one's neediness 
              expands, and one hankers and laments. Young persons, who avoid the 
              gifts that come from voluntary self-dis-cipline, may later find 
              themselves handicapped householders, that is, householders who have 
              difficulty controlling their senses, who are dissatisfied and frustrated. 
              Because they have not taken the time to find the quiet confidence 
              of emotional fulfilment and happiness within themselves, they crave 
              those things from their partner. But fulfilment and happiness are 
              not to be found there. Srila Prabhupada explains: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Unfortunately, in this present civilisation both men and women 
                are allowed to be attracted to one another from the very beginning 
                of life, and because of this they are completely unable to come 
                to the platform of self-realisation. They do not know that without 
                self-realisation they suffer the greatest loss in the human form 
                of life ... The span of youth expires very quickly. One who wastes 
                his life simply by committing sinful activities in youth immediately 
                becomes disappointed and disillusioned when the brief period of 
                youth is over. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>4.27.4-5) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our goal is to re-establish our relationship with God, and we cannot 
              expect to do that by defying His social standards. Moreover, when 
              one is thinking of a qualified companion for a qualified young devotee, 
              one is attracted to a person with inspired devotion, a kind heart 
              and spiritual wisdom. In short, a good devotee, not one who is needy, 
              intemperate and who defies Srila Prabhupada's directives. If we 
              would be married, we must make ourselves marriageable by becoming 
              disciplined human beings. </p>
            <p>We find this description in <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>(4.21.4): 
              'As the King entered the gate of the city ... he was received by 
              many beautiful unmarried girls whose bodies were bedecked with various 
              ornaments'. In his purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, 'A welcome 
              offered by unmarried girls who are internally and externally clean 
              and are dressed in nice garments and ornaments is auspicious. <i>Kumari, 
              </i>or unmarried girls untouched by the hand of any member of the 
              opposite sex, are auspicious members of society'. The <i>kumaris 
              </i>and the <i>brahmacaris </i>(described elsewhere in the <i>Bhagavatam</i>) 
              separately learn to serve God, to worship Him, to become absorbed 
              in enriching, spiritual arts and to explore their unique gifts. 
              By developing their inner and outer lives with same-sex peers, these 
              young people discover their personal mettle, thrive in that discovery, 
              and have a strong sense of self-worth. Their noble and godlike character 
              is not a thing of favour or chance but is the natural result of 
              continued effort, self-control and good association, and their presence 
              is always auspi-cious. Those who would achieve much must also sacrifice 
              much. When young people with a solid personal foundation in self-discipline 
              later enter household life, they also make it auspicious. 'Before 
              entering household life, a student is fully trained to become <i>jitendriya, 
              </i>a conqueror of the senses. Such a mature student is allowed 
              to become a householder.' (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>5.1.18) By Krsna's 
              grace, the future husband and the future wife find fullness and 
              beauty first within themselves and then in each other. </p>
            <p>After several decades, when the challenging journey of householder 
              life finally ends, the singular strength one found in youth and 
              maintained in midlife can fortify one at life's closure. Srila Prabhupada 
              writes: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>... at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to 
                Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered 
                by another ... Draupadi had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadi 
                to come; Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting 
                for her great husbands. And because she was already trained, she 
                at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva, 
                Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>1.15.50) 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The ultimate goal of life is the spiritual growth of the individual; 
              it is our personal journey to the lotus feet of the Lord. Successful 
              training and a successful marriage nurture this most significant 
              journey. In fact, training and marriage exist for nurturing that 
              journey. 'If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement 
              in Krsna consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very 
              effective for such advancement'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>6.18.34) 
            </p>
            <p><i>(2) Incompatibility </i></p>
            <p>Worse than being alone is to be with a person who doesn't like 
              you. Too many devotees have experienced the anguish and chaos caused 
              by an incompatible marriage. Such travesties are systematically 
              avoided in Vaisnava culture because, besides undergoing training 
              and learning restraint before marriage, all care is taken in matchmaking: 
              'Formerly, boys and girls of similar dispositions were married; 
              the similar natures of the boy and girl were united in order to 
              make them happy'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>3.21.15) 'The central 
              idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage 
              would be happy, whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>9.18.23) 'Marriage and friendship are proper between two people 
              who are equal in terms of their wealth, birth, influence, physical 
              appearance and capacity for good progeny, but never between a superior 
              and an inferior'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>10.60.15) We want our 
              life's companion to be a true peer. </p>
            <p>Besides conscientiously matching a suitable young man with a suitable 
              young woman, compatibility also includes the husband having like-minded 
              male friends and the wife having like-minded female friends. All 
              our dialogue need not fall on just one pair of ears, but in confidence, 
              we reveal our mind to and have dedicated and loving ties with handpicked 
              friends. If at some point our marriage is rocky, qualified friends 
              can help us learn from the difficulties and acquire skills to improve 
              our relationship. Marriage is a process of changing and accepting 
              change, of settling differences and living with differences that 
              will never be settled, of drawing close and pulling apart and drawing 
              close again. Good friends smooth the bumps on this long journey. 
            </p>
            <p>Compatibility also includes living with our spouse's faults. Anyone 
              can live with another's good qualities, but can you live with that 
              person's weaknesses? After the initial period of guarded good behaviour, 
              the character flaws we brought with us to the marriage begin to 
              surface, and we face the pain of dealing with both our own and our 
              spouse's shortcomings and the conflicts those create. No two people 
              are completely compatible, and not all incompatibilities in marriage 
              can be worked out. Sometimes inevitable differences can be laughed 
              at, sometimes coped with, sometimes negotiated, sometimes accepted, 
              and sometimes they are complementary. Sometimes waiting and praying 
              is the answer. It is rewarding when, after thousands of these tribulations 
              have come and gone, you know and honour your spouse despite the 
              differences between you. By focusing on closeness, differences become 
              manageable; by focusing on differences, closeness disappears. </p>
            <p>The more one advances in consciousness, the less affected one is 
              by another's failings; conversely, the more neophyte we are, the 
              more those failings will irritate us. Not everyone can be like Mandodari, 
              the chaste wife of Ravana, who was fully aware of her husband's 
              lowly nature and activities and yet remained loyal till the end: 
              'Ravana's wife Mandodari knew very well how cruel a person Ravana 
              was. The very word Ravana means one who causes crying for others 
              ... Thus Ravana was condemned not only by Lord Ramacandra but even 
              by his own wife, Mandodari, who said to the slain body of her husband, 
              By your deeds you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures 
              and your soul fit to go to hell.' (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>9.10.26-8) 
            </p>
            <p><i>(3) An inability to hear </i></p>
            <p>Our prayer is not, 'Dear God, help him (her) see it my way', but, 
              'Please God, show us the way'. Even with spiritual progress as a 
              common goal, even with inner strength and compat-ibility, a marriage 
              will still be painfully difficult if the couple cannot empathetically 
              hear from each other. If we only listen enough to protect our own 
              territory, we lose common ground. If we only hear what we want to 
              hear, we will remain inflexible and unaware of the other's needs. 
              But when we don't impose ourself on the other or allow the other 
              to impose himself or herself on us, hearing is an opportunity for 
              lifetime learning, for responding to healthy needs and for reconciling 
              divergent opinions. A rewarding marriage creates an atmosphere that 
              encourages each person to talk honestly. Emotions need not be repressed; 
              they can be expressed, but expressed considerately, so the other 
              can hear. </p>
            <p>True hearing, total concentration on the other, is to value the 
              other and extend oneself for mutual growth. An essential part of 
              this process is to temporarily set aside our prejudices, frames 
              of reference and desires so as to experience our spouse's world 
              from the inside, stepping into his or her shoes. Sensing this acceptance, 
              the speaker feels inclined to open up more to the listener, and 
              the listener appreciates the speaker more and more. Unfortunately, 
              most couples do not truly hear each other. </p>
            <p>The art of knowing what to say and when to say it and the craft 
              of give and take are part of hearing, as illustrated in this pastime 
              from the Sixth Canto of the <i>Bhagavatam</i>, explained in Srila 
              Prabhupada's purports: 'Mother Parvati could not appreciate Citraketu's 
              position, and therefore she cursed him, but when she understood 
              the instructions of Lord Siva [her husband] she was ashamed ... 
              and covered her face with the skirt of her sari, admitting that 
              she was wrong in cursing Citraketu'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>6.17.35, 
              36) </p>
            <p>However, earlier in this wonderfully intricate narrative, we learned: 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee 
                of Lord Visnu, Sankarsana, was somewhat proud at having achieved 
                Lord Sankarsana's favour and therefore thought that he could now 
                criticise anyone, even Lord Siva. This kind of pride in a devotee 
                is never tolerated ... Mother Parvati was justified in punishing 
                Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticised the supreme father, 
                Mahadeva ... Acting through the heart of Parvati, the Lord, who 
                is situated in everyone's heart, cursed Citraketu in order to 
                end all his material reactions. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>6.17.10, 
                15, 17) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Given this explanation, was there a need for Parvati to hide her 
              face in shame? Yes, for by doing this, instead of an argument to 
              establish who was 'right' and who was 'wrong', we find Parvati acknowledging 
              her husband's greatness, his joking exchange with Citraketu and 
              Citraketu's amazing devotional qualities. Yet, at the same time, 
              her curse remains in tact for the reasons Srila Prabhupada mentions 
              above. The exchange is a beautiful interplay of maturity, humility, 

              knowledge and detachment - a tapestry of harmony despite differences. 
            </p>
            <p>The inability to hear and the inability to speak in such a way 
              that we can be heard creates a husband and wife who 'constantly 
              make material endeavours to eliminate their unhap-piness and unlimitedly 
              increase their pleasure but who inevitably achieve exactly the opposite 
              result'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>11.3.18) </p>
            <p><i>(4) Self-righteousness </i></p>
            <p>At the time of initiation we solemnly vow to avoid intoxication, 
              illicit sex, meat eating and gambling and to chant sixteen rounds 
              of the <i>maha-mantra </i>daily. To preserve these holy vows that 
              we take before the Deity, before the fire and before the Vaisnavas 
              are the most important practices in our spiritual life. Caring for 
              one another means protecting these principles in each other's lives 
              by our example and by our words. </p>
            <p>Yet, if the husband or the wife is not following these principles, 
              we do not have the right to reject that person because we feel superior. 
              The day may come when the roles are reversed, for pride leads to 
              a loss of austerity. Without being condescending and self-righteous, 
              the one who is strict can humbly help the lax one, and the lax one 
              must be willing to accept that help. This is teamwork, an exchange 
              of affection in which one person's misfortune of distraction becomes 
              turned around by the other person's gift of focus. </p>
            <p>If we have too high an estimation of ourselves, we will make our 
              <i>asrama </i>into a war zone. This war may not be over fundamentals, 
              like the regulative principles, but over more minor infractions 
              - wasting time, wasting money, inappropriate behaviour, harsh language, 
              and so forth. Whatever the cause of upset, the discussion and the 
              mood can still be good-natured and hopeful instead of angry and 
              accusative. Contempt is a corrosive that over time breaks down the 
              bond between husband and wife. In the exchange between Parvati and 
              Siva quoted above, instead of contempt and pride, we find light-heartedness 
              and submission. Since both of them are honourable, it is natural 
              for them to honour each other. </p>
            <p>For one who cares about another, confronting that person is not 
              easy; the act has a great potential for arrogance, for to confront 
              is to assume a position of moral superiority over the other - we 
              confront because we want to change the course of that person's life. 
              The reality is that at times, one does know better about a certain 
              matter than the other, and one is obliged to confront the other 
              with the problem. To do this effectively, we must stringently examine 
              the value of our 'wisdom' and our motives behind offering it. (Peck, 
              1978) This self-scrutiny and self-doubting requires the unusual 
              combination of meekness and strength. To fail to confront when confrontation 
              is required is as detrimental as self-righteous con-demnation. When 
              circumstances require it, a partner must sparingly and carefully 
              confront the other, and in turn, submit to being confronted by the 
              other. </p>
            <p><i>(5) Quitting (in a non-abusive relationship) </i></p>
            <p>In marriage, commitment is a journey by two people who have oneness 
              in purpose. When we unearth the taproot of commitment, we come to 
              our commitment to the Supreme Lord Krsna, from whom the quality 
              of commitment originally emanates, in whom it eternally reposes, 
              and who Himself is the perfection of commitment. Sri Krsna says: 
              'To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I 
              give the understanding by which they can come to Me. To show them 
              special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining 
              lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance'. (<i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>10.10-11) The Lord is unwaveringly committed to selflessly serving 
              those who serve Him selflessly. </p>
            <p>Marriage is difficult; once that fact is accepted, it no longer 
              matters. Sometimes, because of false ego, there may be tremendous 
              conflict and disagreement between husband and wife, but if, in this 
              darkness, their mutual commitment to their relationship prevails, 
              that commitment can carry their relationship beyond its troubles 
              to greater intimacy. When quitting is not an option and is not justified, 
              the alternative - sooner or later - is overcoming the difficulty. 
              Difficulties are inevitable, but overcoming them - not quitting 
              - is optional and requires our discipline, courage and wisdom. Our 
              reward is to again resonate, to grow in kindness, in trust and in 
              trustworthiness. Problems and conflict are not an opportunity to 
              quit but to move forward, to become unstuck. As Krsna is mystical, 
              so non-negotiable commitment to His service is also mystical because, 
              by His grace, we can deal with a problem when we take respon-sibility 
              for it. When the Lord sends us a test, He simultaneously gives us 
              the ability to pass that test if we so desire. 'The Lord is so kind 
              to His devotee that when severely testing him the Lord gives him 
              the necessary strength to be tolerant and to continue to remain 
              a glorious devotee'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>8.22.29-30) </p>
            <p>In his last speech to the members of the Gaudiya Matha, delivered 
              on 23 December 1936, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura spoke 
              on remaining committed despite obsta-cles: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Living in this world one has to face many kinds of difficulties. 
                It is not our job to try and remove those difficulties. Nor should 
                they depress us ... We have no attachment or hostility towards 
                anyone in this world. All arrangements of this world are temporary. 
                Everyone has an indispensable need for the Absolute Truth. May 
                all of you with one goal and in harmony with each other, attain 
                the right to serve the original <i>asraya-vigraha </i>[Krsna]. 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We become a husband or a wife as a service to Krsna. Difficulties 
              are not a reason to stop that service or to become discouraged. 
              They are an opportunity, however painful, to serve with fewer conditions. 
              In the end, that self-sacrifice becomes self-enhancement because, 
              for a devotee, sacrifice is an offering to please the Lord. Sacrifice 
              is the surrender of something desirable for the sake of something 
              having a higher claim. We surrender quitting so that we can please 
              Srila Prabhupada. </p>
            <p><i>(6) Selfishness </i></p>
            <p>If we focus on our own needs and negate our partner, the relationship 
              can't last, and if we give up who we are to please our partner, 
              we may suffocate and become frustrated, resentful and depressed. 
              One who is self-controlled doesn't need to lord over another, and 
              neither does that person need to be lorded over by another. Marriage 
              is a balance between satisfying ourself and satisfying our partner. 
              It is maintaining an awareness of the other person and that person's 
              desires, even as the other maintains an awareness of us and our 
              wishes. It is putting ourself out, when necessary, to satisfy the 
              other person's feelings and needs. Marriage is sincerely and respectfully 
              discerning what is best for everyone. </p>
            <p>For example, 'the first duty of a chaste woman is to carry out 
              the order of her husband'. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, Antya-lila, 
              7.106) Yet, in <i>Ramayana </i>we find that when Rama ordered His 
              wife, Sita, to remain in the kingdom until His return from banishment, 
              Sita, renowned as one of five supremely chaste women, insisted that 
              she accompany Rama. Rama's reasoning was that He had been banished, 
              not Sita, and that forest life would be difficult and dangerous 
              for her. But Sita felt that her place was to be with Rama instead 
              of alone in Ayodhya. Had Sita automatically subordinated herself 
              to Rama's will, she would not have been true to herself. Similarly, 
              had Rama insisted that Sita remain behind - for many sound reasons 
              - He would have dishonoured Sita's desire. Sita gave up a comfortable 
              life so that she could fulfil her need to be with Rama, and Rama 
              gave up His vision of a safe life for Sita so that He could please 
              her by allowing her to come with Him. Reason and logic have been 
              delicately tempered by needs and feelings. Both must be taken into 
              consideration for a couple's well-being, so neither feels ignored 
              or suppressed. </p>
            <p>Another beautiful interplay of selflessness is when the the wife 
              of Sudama suggested that her poverty-stricken husband see his friend, 
              Lord Krsna, in Dvaraka. Prabhupada writes, 'The wife was not anxious 
              for her personal comfort, but she felt concerned for her husband, 
              who was such a pious <i>brahmana</i>'. (<i>Krsna, The Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead</i>, Ch. 80) Sudama agreed to go to Dvaraka not because 
              he wanted to ask Krsna for help but because he wanted to see the 
              Lord and to satisfy his wife, who was so eager to satisfy him. </p>
            <p>Selfishness is closely related to the inability to hear, as our 
              preoccupation with ourself makes us deaf to another's voice. To 
              overcome this, we can learn to consider all matters thoughtfully, 
              with due respect to our spouse's point of view. This honest approach, 
              which avoids manipulation and partiality to one's own insights, 
              facilitates finding a better conclu-sion than one person alone could 
              have attained. It is unlikely that the best possible decision will 
              be made if one person imposes his or her will on the other. After 
              all, our will, our deep conviction of what is undoubtedly 'right' 
              and Krsna conscious, may actually be the zeal experienced by neophyte 
              devotees, who, in the words of Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, are 'very 
              expert in arguing though they have no sense of advanced devotional 
              service'. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Madhya-lila, 2.93) In 
              other words, without our being aware of it, our dearly held opinion 
              may cloak selfishness. </p>
            <p>When differences are humbly honoured and balanced, the husband 
              and wife find the room they need for spiritual growth, both individually 
              and as a satisfied couple. A mutual spirit of goodwill shifts their 
              focus from themselves to the other. Each wants the best for the 
              other and each feels the other is an ally. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">What makes it smoother </p>
            <p><i> (1) Enthusiasm </i></p>
            <p>'Without enthusiasm', Srila Prabhupada writes, 'one cannot be successful. 
              Even in the material world, one has to be very enthusiastic in his 
              particular field of activity in order to become successful'. (<i>Nectar 
              of Instruction</i>, p. 30) When Sukanya, a young princess, was wed 
              to Cyavana Muni, an irritable old <i>sadhu</i>, she set her mind 
              not on the apparently unfortunate match but on making a conscientious 
              effort to do her best. She did not try to change her spouse but 
              fully played her role, surrendered her pride and, by perseverance, 
              succeeded in making a marriage that worked. A devotee's enthusiasm 
              crystallises into industriousness, which solidifies into circumstances 
              of Krsna conscious pleasantness and advancement. </p>
            <p>In his introduction to <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </i>Srila Prabhupada 
              explains that our inherent nature is to serve. In this world everyone 
              is rendering service to someone, just as, for example, the wife 
              serves the husband and the husband serves the wife. Both the wife 
              and the husband can be enthusiastic in this service because, as 
              Srila Prabhupada states elsewhere, 'Krsna is pleased when a Vaisnava 
              is rendered service'. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</i>, Madhya-lila, 
              5.24) If our spouse is a devotee and we are sincerely serving that 
              person, we will benefit spiritually. 'Anyone who wishes to advance 
              in Krsna consciousness must try to serve the devotees of Krsna'. 
              (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Antya-lila, 13.113) </p>
            <p>Marriage is like a fortress created by the husband and wife to 
              protect themselves from the powerful enemies of the uncontrolled 
              senses and peacefully make spiritual advance-ment. 'The bodily senses 
              are considered plunderers of the fort of the body. The wife is supposed 
              to be the commander of the fort, and therefore whenever there is 
              an attack on the body by the senses, it is the wife who protects 
              the body from being smashed'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>3.14.20) 
            </p>
            <p>'There is no difference between a good wife and good intelligence. 
              One who possesses good intelligence can deliberate properly and 
              save himself from many dangerous conditions'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>4.26.16) 'One who is situated in household life and who systematically 
              conquers his mind and five sense organs is like a king in his fortress 
              who conquers his powerful enemies'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>5.1.18) 
              As in any battle, if they would be victorious, the fighters must 
              first be enthusiastic. </p>
            <p><i>(2) Gratitude </i></p>
            <p>The health of the marriage depends on the health of the individuals 
              in it, and it is gratitude that keeps those individuals healthy 
              and free from dullness and complacency. As a household dedicated 
              to spiritual cultivation, the <i>grhastha-asrama </i>is founded 
              on the spouses respecting, honouring and appreciating each other 
              as Krsna's devotees. The husband thinks, 'My wife is the sacred 
              and holy property of her spiritual master and of Krsna. She is not 
              mine. If I do not honour her, if I do not respect her, if I do not 
              protect her and provide for her, then I am a <i>vaisnava</i>-<i>aparadhi</i>. 
              I am offending a Vaisnava, and it will seriously impede my spiritual 
              progress'. Similarly, a wife sees her husband as the sacred and 
              holy property of guru and Krsna. She treats him as a Vaisnava and 
              is faithful and assists and serves him in his role as her husband. 
              Each appreciates the sacrifice of the other, the generosity of the 
              other, the loving intent of the other, and each grows in gratitude, 
              overlooking the other's flaws. A sane person wants nothing less 
              than this in marriage and will make the success of such a relationship 
              a top priority. </p>
            <p>An example of marital appreciation from <i>Krsna, The Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead</i>: when the cowherd boyfriends of Krsna were refused 
              alms by the <i>brahmanas </i>who were performing sacrifices, Krsna 
              sent them to the wives of those <i>brahmanas</i>, who ecstatically 
              provided varieties of wonderful foods for Krsna, Balarama and Their 
              friends. Later, the <i>brahmanas </i>understood their foolishness 
              in refusing the boys and appreciated the spiritual advancement of 
              their wives. They said, 'Just see how fortunate these women are 
              who have so devotedly dedicated their lives to the Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead, Krsna ... They have surpassed all of us in firm faith 
              and devotion unto Krsna'. (<i>Krsna, The Supreme Personality of 
              Godhead</i>, Ch. 23) </p>
            <p>In another place Srila Prabhupada writes: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Everyone should be friendly for the service of the Lord. Everyone 
                should praise another's service to the Lord and not be proud of 
                his own service. This is the way of Vaisnava thinking, Vaikuntha 
                thinking ... Everyone should be allowed to render service to the 
                Lord to the best of his ability, and everyone should appreciate 
                the service of others. Such are the activities of Vaikuntha. Since 
                everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform and is 
                allowed to serve the Lord according to his ability. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
                </i>7.5.12) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Sincere gratitude is an antidote for self-righteousness. </p>
            <p><i>(3) Affection </i></p>
            <p>Lord Krsna told Rukmini, 'My dear beautiful wife, you know that 
              because we are householders we are always busy in many household 
              affairs and long for a time when we can enjoy some joking words 
              between us. That is our ultimate gain in household life'. Srila 
              Prabhupada comments, 'Actually, householders work very hard day 
              and night, but all fatigue of the day's labour is minimised as soon 
              as they meet, husband and wife together, and enjoy life in many 
              ways. Lord Krsna wanted to exhibit Himself as being like an ordinary 
              householder who delights himself by exchanging joking words with 
              his wife'. (<i>Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead</i>, Ch. 
              60) Similarly, it is described, 'Lord Siva was sitting in an assembly 
              of great saintly persons and embracing Parvati on his lap with his 
              arm ... For Parvati to be embraced by Lord Siva was natural in a 
              relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing extraordinary'. 
              (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>6.17.5). Also, </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>We always speak of the goddess of fortune as being placed on 
                the chest of Narayana. In other words, the wife must remain embraced 
                by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected ... 
                Just as intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved 
                chaste wife should always have her place on the chest of a good 
                husband. This is the proper relationship between husband and wife. 
                A wife is therefore called <i>ardhangani, </i>or half of the body. 
                One cannot remain with only one leg, one hand or only one side 
                of the body. He must have two sides. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>4.26.17) 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A prerequisite for affection is acceptance, and from acceptance 
              grows a rich understanding and deep trust between the husband and 
              wife. In marriages that have endured for some time, the partners 
              are comfortably and effortlessly together, whether in dialogue or 
              in silence. They can always be themselves, with nothing to prove, 
              nothing to get, no need to impress. They feel mutually secure, cared 
              for, wanted and valued. The strength of their affection allows them 
              to enjoy each other's company - foibles and all. Affection shifts 
              frustration, anger and blame to friendliness, understanding and 
              kindness. </p>
            <p><i>(4) Contentment </i></p>
            <p>Everyone's goal is to enter into and and remain in the elusive 
              condition called 'happiness'. To be happy we must be peaceful. In 
              Krsna's words, 'How can there be happiness without peace?'(<i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>2.66) To be peaceful we must be content with whatever situation 
              we are in. We accept our lot in life and are happy even if we don't 
              completely settle our marital discord. 'One should be satisfied 
              with whatever he achieves by his previous destiny, for discontent 
              can never bring happiness'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>8.19.24) There 
              is no element of chance in the circumstances of our life - they 
              are the result of a law that cannot err, and they are our destiny 
              created by our past activities. It is as futile to rail against 
              our pains and misfortunes as it is to toil to increase our pleasures. 
              'Without endeavour, one can get the amount of happiness and distress 
              for which he is destined. And one cannot change this. Therefore, 
              it is better to use one's time for advancement in the spiritual 
              life of Krsna consciousness'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>7.7.42) 
            </p>
            <p><i>(5) A long-term vision </i></p>
            <p>When King Yayati was cursed to immediately become old, he was also 
              benedicted that he could exchange his old age with another's youth. 
              Yayati approached his son, Yadu, for this exchange, but Yadu refused, 
              not out of defiance or a desire for sense gratification but because 
              Yadu had a long-term Krsna conscious vision: he wanted to use his 
              youth to attain the renounced order in the future. Srila Prabhupada 
              explains: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Maharaja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord's 
                service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material 
                desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and 
                unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there 
                is a chance of one's being disturbed in rendering service to the 
                Lord. We have actually seen that many <i>sannyasis </i>who accept 
                <i>sannyasa </i>prematurely, not having satisfied their material 
                desires, fall down because they are disturbed. Therefore the general 
                process is to go through <i>grhastha </i>life and <i>vanaprastha 
                </i>life and finally come to <i>sannyasa </i>and devote oneself 
                completely to the service of the Lord. Maharaja Yadu was ready 
                to accept his father's order and exchange youth for old age because 
                he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned. 
                But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement 
                in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father's 
                old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. 
                (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>9.18.40) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The husband and wife play their roles expertly so that eventually 
              they will expertly distinguish reality from illusion, become fully 
              self-realised and attain love of God. 'If a man is in good consciousness, 
              he consults with his religious wife, and as a result of this consultation, 
              with intelligence, one advances in his ability to estimate the value 
              of life. In other words, if one is fortunate enough to have a good, 
              conscientious wife, he can decide by mutual consultation that human 
              life is meant for advancing in Krsna consciousness'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>4.27.6) </p>
            <p><i>(6) Krsna consciousness </i></p>
            <p>Our home is Krsna's property, and when we orient all the affairs 
              of our home around its proprietor, Krsna - around service to the 
              Deities - then all our household activities are devotional service. 
              If we're Krsna conscious, if we're actually <i>grhasthas, </i>then 
              everything we do is spiritual. 'According to Bhaktivinoda Thakura, 
              a husband and wife can turn the home into a place as good as Vaikuntha, 
              even while in this material world. Being absorbed in Krsna consciousness, 
              even in this world husband and wife can live in Vaikuntha simply 
              by installing the Deity of the Lord within the home and serving 
              the Deity according to the directions of the <i>sastras</i>'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>4.23.29) When we worship the Deity, when we offer all our food, 
              when we share <i>prasadam </i>with our family, when we regularly 
              invite devotees to come and when we serve them <i>prasadam, </i>have 
              <i>kirtana </i>and discuss Krsna topics, our home is a sacred place. 
            </p>
            <p>To the degree that we see our <i>asrama </i>as a means to serve 
              and please Krsna, it will be a facility for advancing in Krsna consciousness. 
              To the degree that we desire material satis-faction, household life 
              will distract us from Krsna consciousness. 'Generally a person cannot 
              make much advancement in spiritual consciousness if he is married. 
              He becomes attached to his family and is prone to sense gratification. 
              Thus his spiritual advancement is very slow or almost nil'. (<i>Sri 
              Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Antya-lila, 13.112) Whether our marriage 
              helps or hinders is a question of consciousness; in other words, 
              it is up to us. </p>
            <p>A Krsna conscious marriage is meant to bring us into greater alignment 
              with our spiritual nature. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised the householder 
              Kurma, 'Remain at home and chant the holy name of Krsna always. 
              Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Sri Krsna as they 
              are given in the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>... 
              If you follow this instruction, your materialistic life at home 
              will not obstruct your spiritual advancement. Indeed, if you follow 
              these regulative principles, we will again meet here, or, rather, 
              you will never lose My company'. Srila Prabhupada comments: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Many people come and inquire whether they have to give up family 
                life to join the Society, but that is not our mission. One can 
                remain comfortably in his residence. We simply request everyone 
                to chant the <i>maha-mantra: </i>Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna 
                Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. 
                If one is a little literate and can read <i>Bhagavad-gita As It 
                Is </i>and <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>that is so much the better. 
                If a devotee follows the instructions of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, 
                he lives in the company of the Lord. Wherever he lives, he converts 
                that place into Vrndavana and Navadvipa. This means that materialism 
                cannot touch him. This is the secret of success for one advancing 
                in Krsna consciousness. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Madhya-lila, 
                7.128-9) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Similarly, when a <i>grhastha </i>resident of Kulina-grama asked 
              Lord Caitanya, 'My Lord, kindly tell me what my duty is and how 
              I should execute it'. The Lord replied, 'You should engage yourself 
              in the service of the servants of Krsna and always chant the holy 
              name of Krsna. If you do these two things, you will very soon attain 
              shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>Madhya-lila, 
              16.69-70) </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
            <p>'In a restaurant or place for drinking cold water, many travellers 
              are brought together, and after drinking water they continue to 
              their respective destinations. Similarly, living entities join together 
              in a family, and later, as a result of their own actions, they are 
              led apart to their destinations'. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>7.2.21) 
              Srila Prabhupada remarks, 'In the material world a so-called family 
              is a combination of several persons in one home to fulfil the terms 
              of their imprisonment. As criminal prisoners scatter as soon as 
              their terms are over and they are released, all of us who have temporarily 
              assembled as family members will continue to our respective destinations'. 
            </p>
            <p>By Srila Prabhupada's grace, may Lord Sri Krsna's philosophy be 
              our solace, our guide, and a source of enduring strength, patience 
              and determination. As much as we take Srila Prabhupada's words into 
              our hearts and realise them, that much will our present and future 
              circumstances improve, for it is our consciousness that determines 
              the states of being we shall attain. </p>
            <p>Each of us is inconceivably fortunate because Krsna, our best friend, 
              is on our side; He wants us with Him. That we are not with Him is 
              due only to our causeless unwillingness. May our service to the 
              Lord as a husband or a wife eradicate that causeless unwillingness.
