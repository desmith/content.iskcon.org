            <p class="maintextsubhead">Translated by Gopiparanadhana Dasa <br>
              Publisher: Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Grödinge, Sweden, 2002 <br>
              ISBN: 91-7149-439-1 </p>
            <p>This work is the first of a projected three-volume English translation 
              of Sanatana Gosvami's two-part 16th century magnum opus<i>, </i>the 
              <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta</i>. As a self-contained didactic narrative, 
              Volume One ('Finding the Essence of the Supreme Lord's Mercy') offers 
              us a fascinating, often humorous, exploration, clarification, and 
              elaboration of themes and motifs found in the Caitanya Vaisnava 
              tradition's most central text, the <i>Bhagavata Purana. </i></p>
            <p>As noted by the translator, Gopiparanadhana Dasa, the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta 
              </i>belongs broadly to the quest genre of literature. As one follows 
              sage Narada in his search for the 'greatest recipient of Krsna's 
              mercy' it becomes clear that the quest's reward is a cumulative 
              understanding and appreciation of <i>krsna-bhakti</i>, unreserved 
              devotion to the Supreme Lord, understood by Sanatana to be Krsna 
              as celebrated in the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>. </p>
            <p>As in any good quest story, the journey itself is the reward. Narada's 
              search allows the reader or listener to meet several exemplar devotees 
              encountered in the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>, this time 'off stage', 
              as it were, enabling Sanatana to unfold a nuanced presentation of 
              the <i>Bhagavatam's </i>devotional message in a concentrated if 
              not altogether systematic manner. Sanatana's auto-commentary, closely 
              paraphrased by the translator, offers yet further explication and 
              enrichment of the text. The commentary serves in several capacities, 
              such as highlighting links between a given verse and previous verses; 
              offering proof-texts from a variety of sources; adding interesting 
              details; and exploring theological ramifica-tions of statements 
              in the text. </p>
            <p>A glance at the 'Expanded Table of Contents' (in the back of the 
              book) makes clear the pattern structuring Narada's travels. Upon 
              meeting each successive recipient of Krsna's mercy, Narada's praise 
              is refuted by the recipient of praise, who directs Narada onward 
              to the one he considers more praiseworthy. One soon catches the 
              point: Narada's praises are always fitting and true (to the <i>Bhagavatam's 
              </i>presentation of devotional reality), <i>and </i>the refutations 
              by the respective devotees (showing their humility, but also their 
              genuine appre-ciation of other devotees) are equally fitting and 
              true (in pointing always beyond themselves to the greater reality 
              of which they are parts). While bringing readers to understand the 
              Caitanya Vaisnava message that Krsna's associates in Vrndavana (especially 
              the gopis) are the greatest recipients of His mercy, Sanatana conveys 
              several lessons prerequisite to becoming oneself a participant in 
              Krsna's loving exchanges. </p>
            <p>It is clear that this is a work written mainly for persons aspiring 
              to become adepts in <i>krsna-bhakti</i>, and who are probably more 
              or less familiar with the <i>Bhagavata Purana. </i>At the same time, 
              it is so structured, especially with the explanatory commentary, 
              that it can serve as an introduction, or even as a 'study guide' 
              for the <i>Bhagavatam</i>. Yet it goes further, invit-ing even the 
              accomplished reader of the <i>Bhagavatam </i>to explore with Sanatana 
              the question left unresolved in that text: Does Krsna ever return 
              to Vrndavana, and if not, why not? </p>
            <p>To deal with these questions, one is taken, along with an unwitting 
              Krsna, to 'Nava-vrndavana', a facsimile of the original fashioned 
              by Visvakarma, the cosmic architect. What follows, as Krsna awakens, 
              is a touch of situation comedy culminating in Krsna expressing confusion 
              over His own identity: 'When Krsna looked around the seacoast, He 
              noticed His own great city visible in the distance. Krsna was surprised 
              and exclaimed, What is this? Where am I? Who am I?' (7.54). Only 
              after He has inadvertently demonstrated the depth of his affection 
              for the Vrndavana residents (all present as statues) to the on-looking 
              Dvaraka residents does Krsna 'come to His senses', reminded by Balarama 
              of His mission to 'remove the burden of the earth', and hence duty-bound 
              to remain in Dvaraka. On the suggestion that He should reassure 
              his Vrndavana devotees by returning to them, Krsna reasons that 
              His personal presence in Vrndavana would only aggravate the problem 
              (of their suffering feelings of separation) rather than solve it. 
            </p>
            <p>This last episode is particularly intriguing as a study of Krsna's 
              two competing identities, as Gokulesvara and Vaikunthesvara - the 
              Lord of Gokula (Vrndavana, the realm of sweetness and intimacy) 
              and of Vaikuntha (the transcendent majestic realm). But perhaps 
              even more interesting is the notion that Krsna's devotees can put 
              Him into 'illusion' for the sake of showing His devotion for His 
              devotees, a notion that serves to counterpoint a theme running throughout 
              the work, namely the problem of communicating exalted truth through 
              language, coupled with the issue of qualified readership, addressed 
              in the commentary to the first verse: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Is it not beyond the scope of good fortune for ordinary persons 
                to hear about and understand the uniqueness of devotion of Krsna? 
                Since this book attempts to make public the secret glories of 
                Krsna, one might therefore ask whether writing such a book is 
                not a hopeless endeavour. (p. 7) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The answer, we are assured, is that by the mercy of Krsna in His 
              form as Sri Caitanya the endeavour is by no means hopeless. Implied 
              is that readers/listeners are granted access to that mercy, such 
              that by the end of this first volume he or she will be ready to 
              adopt the same mood of humility qualifying the sages of Prayaga 
              after hearing from Narada, in prepara-tion to read or hear the second 
              part of the work wherein one accompanies the spiritual aspirant 
              Gopa Kumara on his journey to Goloka, the ultimate realm of <i>krsna-prema. 
              </i></p>
            <p>With this volume, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust presents its first 
              complete translation from a Sanskrit text done by followers of Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Prabhupada. All previous BBT publications had been translations 
              and commentaries by Prabhupada, completions of translations and 
              commentaries begun by Prabhupada, or compilations of selected lectures 
              by him. </p>
            <p>This volume represents a very positive indication that members 
              of ISKCON and its publisher, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, are competent 
              to carry on the legacy of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in conveying 
              the teachings and devotional understanding of the Caitanya Vaisnava 
              tradition. With the effective conveyance of this literary tradition, 
              one can hope to see the makings and continuation of a genuinely 
              vibrant devotional culture able to attract thoughtful persons to 
              participate in its ongoing enrichment. </p>
