            <p class="maintext">From a mundane perspective, the death of Tamal 
              Krsna Goswami (Thomas G. Herzig) on 15 March 2002 was a tremendous 
              loss: to his religious community, the International Society for 
              Krishna Consciousness, and to the world of scholarship in the academic 
              study of religion. Goswami, as he wished to be called, both in the 
              Divinity Faculty and in his College, Clare Hall, in the University 
              of Cambridge, was my doctoral student. In the UK, there is generally 
              no panel of doctoral advisers, as in North America. There is a single 
              supervisor who bears sole responsibility for the candidate's academic 
              progress. As can be imagined, potentially this makes for a close 
              academic relationship between supervisor and candidate. So it was 
              with Goswami and myself. Goswami was coming to the end of three 
              years' research, and I had the opportunity to know him well. </p>
            <p>The prospect of supervising Tamal Krsna Goswami was first raised 
              with me in April 1997. Professor Lonnie D. Kliever, then Chair of 
              the Department of Religious Studies at Southern Methodist University, 
              Dallas, wrote to me, commending Goswami as a prospective candidate. 
              I had met Professor Kliever at SMU several years earlier, and respected 
              him as a person and a scholar. Goswami had also come recommended 
              by Professor Kenneth Cracknell, formerly of Cambridge, England, 
              but now teaching and residing in Dallas. Kenneth was also someone 
              I looked up to as a friend and scholar. So I decided to give careful 
              consideration to Goswami's case. Goswami was a renounced monk who 
              was approaching middle age. If Cambridge and I were to consider 
              him seriously, he would have to give evidence of having gone through 
              several academic hoops of training in the academic study of religion 
              and other criteria of competence. I was impressed to learn that 
              even at his age he was resolute and mentally flexible enough to 
              be succeeding in the appropriate undergraduate course conditions: 
              a good degree and competence in Sanskrit. In the event, Goswami 
              gave evidence of meeting both requirements. This was accompanied 
              by excellent references. </p>
            <p>In the half millennium history of the Divinity Faculty at the University 
              of Cambridge, no student of Goswami's background had been accepted 
              before. There were understand-able doubts about his preparedness 
              for a senior research degree. As a renounced monk with pastoral 
              and teaching responsibilities in an organisation with no track record 
              at the time of successful doctoral candidates in the academy, would 
              he be able to do what was needed? These were legitimate questions. 
              But I considered the evidence and had a personal interview with 
              Goswami. I decided to take him on, and the Faculty's Degree Committee, 
              after inspecting the evidence themselves, decided to back my recommendation. 
            </p>
            <p>Neither I nor the Faculty ever had reason to regret our decision. 
              Goswami seemed naturally to slip into the academic groove. Accustomed 
              to giving guidance from a position of authority, he also had the 
              ability to place himself with the right attitude at the receiving 
              end educationally. He accepted guidance with grace and humility, 
              read voraciously, worked with great intensity to deadlines, and 
              wrote with clarity and power. His doctoral topic was the 'Krishnaology' 
              of ISKCON's founder, Swami Prabhupada. His personal knowledge of 
              Prabhupada's teaching was vast, he was extremely well-informed about 
              scholarship on the Society, and he had innovative and penetrating 
              ideas. In my view, he succeeded in researching his subject matter 
              with integrity, the requisite criticality, and much originality. 
            </p>
            <p>When Goswami's life was tragically cut short, his thesis was almost 
              finished. He placed the last chapter of his dissertation on my desk 
              before he left for India. We were due to discuss it the week after 
              his return. It is my intention to seek to publish the thesis in 
              his name after due formalities have been seen to. </p>
            <p>If this can be accomplished, the thesis, I am sure, will be of 
              great benefit to ISKCON and the scholarly world. In a letter to 
              me, dated 18 April 1997, before he was accepted to study at Cambridge, 
              Goswami explained his motivations for seeking a PhD. I quote: </p>
            <p>They are: </p>
            <p>(1) to explore and understand my own religious tradition by means 
              of the best canons of critical scholarship; </p>
            <p>(2) to become an effective interpreter of my own religious tradition; 
            </p>
            <p>(3) to become an informed participant in inter-religious dialogue; 
            </p>
            <p>(4) to become a participant in the ongoing efforts to understand 
              new religious movements within the academy; </p>
            <p>(5) to share with my own tradition a broader vision of its place 
              in history and the wider contribution it can make to the world; 
              and </p>
            <p>(6) to participate in the development of higher education within 
              my own institution. </p>
            <p>Here speaks a man of integrity: integrity with respect to his own 
              personal commitment, and integrity with respect to his commitment 
              to critical scholarship. Goswami's thesis succeeds in combining 
              both. From one point of view, ISKCON is in an important phase of 
              transition. Unless it meets the present challenge of implementing 
              Goswami's aims, it will gradually and inevitably sink into a mire 
              of internal and petty squabbles and lapse into the obscurity of 
              a minor cult. But if it strives to face the world and meet this 
              challenge in the way outlined by Goswami, it has every chance of 
              sturdy and healthy growth and of contributing to the wellbeing of 
              society at large. Though, as some know, evidence of internecine 
              disagreements in ISKCON has surfaced, there is also refreshing evidence 
              of a number of other members working seriously in academia to meet 
              the objectives outlined by Goswami. Much seems to be at stake. In 
              stating his aims for accomplishing a doctoral degree, Goswami was 
              a courageous pioneer and a man of vision, and an inspiration, not 
              only for his Society but also for the goals of scholarship more 
              generally. I wish to pay tribute to his dedication, courage and 
              pioneering scholarship. </p>
