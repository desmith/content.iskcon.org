              Jr. </a></p>
            <p align="left"><i>Long-term ISKCON watcher, Burke Rochford, sets 
              the scene for the Vaisnava Family and Youth Conference by outlining 
              the relevant trends in ISKCON membership. He notes how over the 
              last two decades ISKCON has become a far more family-oriented and 
              household-based, and therefore less temple-centred, congregation. 
              Drawing on his seminal Prabhupada Centennial Survey, he looks at 
              how this demographic shift affects members' commitment to the organisation 
              and to spiritual practice. How importance is collective and individual 
              spiritual practice to ISKCON's householder members? What are their 
              attitudes to ISKCON authority and how has their commitment to ISKCON 
              and Krsna developed? The answers in this paper may chal-lenge some 
              preconceptions. </i></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="left"><i>... wherever there aren't any householders a 
                religion can't live. </i>(Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, 2001) 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This paper considers change within ISKCON since the mid-1980s - 
              specifically, the ascendancy of the nuclear family and the corresponding 
              demise of communalism. Some within the movement have suggested that 
              this change has been detrimental to ISKCON and its membership, that 
              members' religious commitments and levels of involvement have declined 
              as householder life has expanded. This decline is seen as undermining 
              individual religious advancement and the viability of ISKCON as 
              a religious organisation. </p>
            <p>The findings and discussion presented here suggest that ISKCON 
              in North America has changed dramatically as a religious movement 
              and that the growth of householder life has brought about new patterns 
              of individual religiosity. As ISKCON has progressed toward becoming 
              a congregational movement of independent householders, the private 
              dimensions of Krsna consciousness have gained prominence at the 
              expense of collective religious practice and ISKCON involvement. 
              In essence, this change has not meant a decline in religious practice 
              and involvement, but rather a shift in the ways householders express 
              their religiosity. Given the developments I discuss here, it seems 
              appropriate to suggest that the home, and householder life generally, 
              be elevated from its longstanding 'inferior' status. Such a development 
              would be consistent with trends in other religious groups and traditions. 
              As a Hassidic Jewish woman from the Crown Heights section of New 
              York remarked, </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="left">A lot of what we do is done in private [within the 
                household], but in our lives 'private' does not mean 'inferior.' 
                Despite what everyone believes, the synagogue is not the center 
                of Jewish life. The home is ... the place where all the really 
                practical bridges to a religious life are built. (quoted in Harris, 
                pp. 125-6) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Indeed, the household, whether intentionally or not, has become 
              the very centre of religious life within ISKCON's North American 
              communities and throughout much of the ISKCON world. (Rochford 1995a, 
              2000) </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Householder life and organisational change 
              in ISKCON </p>
            <p>Marriage and family life have played key roles in the development 
              of ISKCON in North America. During ISKCON's beginning years in the 
              late 1960s and early 1970s, there were relatively few married members, 
              and fewer still who had families. Even in 1980, there was about 
              an equal percentage of single renunciates and married householders 
              within ISKCON. Only about one in four had children at that time. 
              By the early 1990s, however, ISKCON had become a householder movement, 
              with the large majority of its membership married and having children. 
              <sup><a name="1"></a><a href="#1a">1</a> </sup>(Rochford 1995a, 
              p. 156; Rochford 1997, 1998a) </p>
            <p>Up until the early 1980s, ISKCON's management retained considerable 
              control over married and family life. (Rochford 1995b, 1997) Indeed, 
              virtually all ISKCON members were subject to the control of the 
              movement and its largely renunciate leadership. As Ravindra Svarupa 
              Dasa (2000, p. 37) has argued, the ability of ISKCON's leaders to 
              control people within the movement was based largely on the latter 
              being financially dependent. Yet marriage and family life were subject 
              to still further control through ongoing preaching meant to disparage 
              marriage as a 'dark well' spiritually, suitable only for those unable 
              to live a strict Krishna conscious lifestyle. (Ravindra Svarupa 
              Dasa 1994, Rochford 1997) Marriage was thus devalued and involved 
              a loss of status, especially for men. </p>
            <p>As ISKCON's economic fortunes began to change after 1976, when 
              book distribution declined dramatically, (Rochford 1985, p. 175) 
              ISKCON's social organisation changed with it. Lacking adequate financial 
              resources to sustain its collective way of life, communalism gave 
              way to the nuclear family as the basis of ISKCON's social organisation. 
              Associ-ated with this were a number of related changes: (a) most 
              parents were forced into the outside labour market to seek employment; 
              (b) children, previously cared for in <i>asrama-</i>based <i>gurukulas</i>, 
              were returned to the care of their parents; and, (c) householders 
              increasingly lived independently of ISKCON, forming enclave communities 
              near an ISKCON temple. (Rochford 1995b, 1997) Accompanying these 
              changes was the ongoing crisis involving ISKCON's leadership and 
              the resulting demise of religious authority attributed to the gurus 
              and the GBC. (Rochford 1995b, p. 168-71, Rochford 1998a, 1998b) 
              Moreover, renunciate leaders often claimed disinterest in householder 
              affairs and the struggles of devotee parents and their children. 
            </p>
            <p>By the mid to late 1980s, ISKCON had become a very different movement 
              from what it had been during its early years. Congregationalism 
              had displaced ISKCON's previous sectarian structure and way of life. 
              Accompanying this change was a shift in the ways that devotees involved 
              themselves in Krishna consciousness and ISKCON. It is these latter 
              issues and their implications that frame the interests of the present 
              paper. I want to briefly present a number of findings suggestive 
              of the new ISKCON, one that is defined by householder life as the 
              very centre of Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Data and methods </p>
            <p>Findings presented in this paper are based on data from the Prabhupada 
              Centennial Survey. This survey was conducted from 1994 to 1995 with 
              approximately 2000 respondents from 53 different countries. (see 
              Rochford 1998a, 1999) The findings reported below include full-time 
              temple devotees and congregational ISKCON members residing in the 
              United States and Canada. </p>
            <p>Appendix 1 details the dimensions of commitment and involvement, 
              as well as the variables and specific measures used in the present 
              investigation. Virtually all of these dimensions and measures were 
              used in my analysis of the Prabhupada Centennial Survey data as 
              reported to the GBC in November 1998. The specific details relating 
              to scale construction can be found in the original GBC report (see 
              Rochford 1998a). </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Findings </p>
            <p><i>Collective religious life </i></p>
            <p>As shown in Table 1, householders with children are significantly 
              less involved in ISKCON's collective religious life than devotees 
              without children, married or unmarried (see Appendix 1, 1.A. for 
              specific measures). The higher mean score for those without children 
              indicates that they attend the morning temple programme more often 
              than those with children. </p>
            <p>The explanation here is largely a matter of availability; parents 
              with children simply find it more difficult to regularly attend 
              early morning programmes in the temple. With get-ting children off 
              to school, getting ready for work and the like, parents find it 
              difficult to attend the morning programme in the temple. </p>
            <p>Table 1<i><br>
              Mean differences between ISKCON members with and without children 
              (see Appendix 1 for corresponding questions) </i></p>
            <p><img src="../../images/icj/rochfordtable.gif" width="583" height="710"></p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>Table 1, with two exceptions, presents mean 
              scores for the above dimensions comparing devotee respondents with 
              and without children. Some numerical scores on the right side of 
              the table have a attached to them. These symbols are used to indicate 
              statistical significance of varying degrees. Mean scores reported 
              without these symbols indicate that there was no meaningful statistical 
              difference found between the mean scores reported for a particular 
              dimension (e.g., follow the regulative principles). The number in 
              parentheses under each of the mean scores represents the total number 
              of respondents used in the calculation. <br>
              * p &lt; .10<br>
              l p &lt; .05 <br>
              l p &lt; .01 <br>
              § p &lt; .001 </p>
            <p><i>Voluntary service </i></p>
            <p>Parents contribute less time doing volunteer service in their local 
              ISKCON community than devotees without family obligations. Although 
              a near equal percentage of devotees with and without children contribute 
              some unpaid work to their local ISKCON community, those without 
              children contribute far more time. If we consider both the mean 
              and median number of hours of volunteer work committed weekly, devotees 
              without children contribute far more (see Table 1). </p>
            <p>Here again, the explanation lies with the fact that parents are 
              working, tending to the needs of their children and households, 
              and, as we will see, tending to their own individual religious practices. 
            </p>
            <p><i>Individual religious practice </i></p>
            <p>There are no major differences in individual religious practice 
              between devotees with children and those without. In fact, parents 
              with children are more involved in a variety of private/individual 
              religious practices such as chanting, offering food, reading Prabhupada's 
              books, listening to tapes of Prabhupada, and holding worship services 
              at home. As can be further seen in Table 1, those with and without 
              children follow the four regulative principles equally. </p>
            <p>As the findings suggest, family life in no way diminishes individual 
              religious practice. While family life clearly limits collective 
              religious practice, it has no apparent adverse affects on individual 
              religiosity. Rather than going to the temple in the morning to chant 
              their rounds or to attend <i>arati</i>, many householders reproduce 
              this worship within their households with members of their family 
              and perhaps friends. Worship in this sense has become increasingly 
              privatised. The temple is no longer the primary place where devotees 
              worship and otherwise conduct their daily religious practice. </p>
            <p><i>Preaching </i></p>
            <p>Many have commented about the apparent lack of preaching and book 
              distribution occurring in North America. Implicitly, householders 
              are often blamed for having lost the preaching spirit. Yet when 
              we compare parents and non-parents, we find little difference between 
              the two with respect to commitments to preaching (see Appendix 1, 
              2.E. for specific measures). It is true, however, that 58% of those 
              without children, as opposed to 48% of those with children, disagree 
              with the statement, 'I have little desire to go out in public and 
              distribute books and preach'. </p>
            <p>Yet preaching itself has undergone change as ISKCON has increasingly 
              become a congregational movement. Preaching is no longer confined 
              to book distribution in public loca-tions. Rather, preaching today 
              is more likely to occur in the workplace and other less public settings. 
              Over 50% of those with and without children say that they 'actively 
              preach to non-devotees at work and/or as part of [their] daily routine'. 
              Moreover, nearly two-thirds of those employed in non-devotee work 
              environments reveal their identity as Krsna devotees to their co-workers. 
              What some have called the failure to preach, in fact, represents 
              a shift in the style and location of preaching. Preaching now occurs 
              more frequently through social relationships in the workplace and 
              in other more private and less visible locations. As such, preaching 
              remains largely out of sight of leaders and other ISKCON members. 
              Given this invisibility, it is not feasible to award this form of 
              preaching the equivalent of <i>sankirtana </i>scores to be read 
              out and publicly acknowledged during the morning programme. </p>
            <p>Also less acknowledged is the ongoing preaching work performed 
              by parents as they train their children in the religious values, 
              practices, and lifestyle of Krsna consciousness. Too often this 
              work has been taken for granted, yet for most parents this represents 
              the most significant activity they perform, not only for their children 
              but potentially for ISKCON as well. </p>
            <p><i>Authority </i></p>
            <p>As shown clearly in Table 1, parents are far more likely to challenge 
              the authority of the <i>gurus </i>and the GBC than devotees without 
              children (see measures in Appendix 1, 2.A and C). The very institutions 
              that embody religious authority within ISKCON (apart from Prabhupada) 
              have been subject to serious questioning and accorded little trust 
              and respect by ISKCON's membership generally (see also Rochford 
              1998b, 1999). But as the findings suggest, those with children are 
              far less likely to accept the authority of the GBC and the guru 
              institution as it has emerged following Prabhupada's disappearance. 
              Given this lack of trust, devotee parents are far more likely to 
              favour a more democratic GBC structure and greater organisational 
              controls on the gurus and the guru institution, as demonstrated 
              in Table 1 (see Appendix 1, 2.B and D). Further evidence of this 
              is reflected in the comments of one parent and long-time ISKCON 
              member, who commented angrily: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>They forced us out to find jobs and live on our own; to raise 
                our families with little money and after being separated from 
                our children for so long. After so much service. Now they [the 
                leaders] turn around and criticise us because we did what they 
                told us to do. That somehow we are materialistic because we live 
                outside. How can I have respect for them? (Rochford 1995b, p. 
                171) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><i>Commitment to ISKCON and Krsna consciousness </i></p>
            <p>Despite the differences noted with respect to collective religious 
              practices, hours of volunteer work, authority attributed to the 
              GBC and the gurus, and the need for reforming both the GBC and guru 
              institutions, devotees with and without children remain more or 
              less equally committed to Krsna consciousness and to ISKCON (see 
              Table 1). These findings sug-gest that children and family life 
              stand as barriers to collective religious practice and organisational 
              involvement but not to commitment or private forms of religiosity. 
              In the end, the emergence of the nuclear family effectively limited 
              the ability of parents to act in ways consistent with their collective 
              identity as ISKCON members. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Discussion and conclusion </p>
            <p>According to the distinguished British sociologist of religion, 
              Bryan Wilson (1976), religion necessarily functions within the context 
              of community. Secularisation - change in the direction of accommodation 
              with mainstream cultures - represents the decline of community. 
              (Wilson 1976, pp. 265-6) When community no longer serves as a meaningful 
              basis of social organisation, religion succumbs to privatisation, 
              its more public and collective elements fading into the background, 
              leaving the residual - individual religiosity - as the essence of 
              religious life. This is true largely because group ritual and participation 
              lose meaning and relevance in the absence of a functioning community 
              of believers. (Wilson 1982, p. 160) Moreover, as the community disintegrates 
              and loses its previous 'sacred' meaning and significance, traditional 
              structures of authority simultaneously lose their ability to exert 
              control over the actions of individual believers. It was precisely 
              such a pattern of change that was associated with the expansion 
              of the nuclear family in ISKCON during the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
            <p>So what does this pattern of growing privatisation mean for ISKCON? 
              It could mean that the organisation and its leadership will continue 
              the pattern of denigrating family life. Yet this tactic has already 
              proven destructive in a variety of ways, including the neglect and 
              abuse of women and children. A wiser strategy, and one that is already 
              underway in some quarters, is to promote family life as the very 
              foundation of ISKCON's future. Despite the failure to hold the commitment 
              of a majority of the second generation, it still remains true that 
              children represent ISKCON's hope for the future. (Rochford 1998a) 
              The number of new recruits coming into ISKCON's communities in North 
              America remains small. Unlikely to sustain itself entirely by recruiting 
              new members, ISKCON's future as an organisation lies with developing 
              strong families, families that, for the most part, are practicing 
              Krsna consciousness within private households. Yet, as our Hassidic 
              friend reminds us, 'private' does not mean 'inferior'. It is time 
              for ISKCON's scholars and leaders to study the scripture, and to 
              listen to Prabhupada's words, with an eye toward elevating the status 
              of householder life. To do otherwise, I believe, risks the very 
              future of Prabhupada's movement. </p>
            <p>But while Krsna consciousness promises to be practiced largely 
              in the context of family life, there are dangers ahead. As Peter 
              Berger states in his classic text, <i>The Sacred Canopy</i>, the 
              family is a 'tenuous construction' for religious meaning. Religion 
              within the sub-world of the family challenges the very possibility 
              of sustaining an 'integrated set of definitions of reality that 
              ... serve as a common universe of meaning'. (Berger, p. 134-5) A 
              religious system practiced largely within independent nuclear families 
              risks becoming fragmented as individuals craft their own personal 
              religious beliefs and practices relatively unencumbered by religious 
              tradition. To counter this requires leaders whose religious authority 
              is beyond questioning. Yet this authority is presently under siege. 
              Over the past two decades ISKCON has witnessed a 'decay of spiritual 
              authority in general'. (Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, 2000, p. 38) Because 
              of this, ISKCON's leaders face the urgent task of restoring trust, 
              the very foundation of religious authority. Without religious authority 
              as embodied within the GBC and guru institutions, Krsna consciousness 
              as a 'lived religion' is likely to move along the path of least 
              resistance, thus compromising the spiritual vitality of the tradition. 
              Householder life must therefore be promoted as the centre of a Krsna 
              conscious life; central to this is the recognition of the importance 
              of teaching children within the household. But this also must be 
              accompanied by a revitalisation of ISKCON's institutions of religious 
              authority to both restore trust and provide spiritual direction 
              for the movement's growing congregation of householders. </p>
