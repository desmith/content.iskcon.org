            <p align="left"><i>A personal reflection on the legacy of a </i>gurukula 
              <i>education by a </i>gurukula <i>alumnus. Yudhisthira Dasa gives 
              a first-hand account of how ISKCON </i>gurukulas <i>prepared their 
              students for life in the wider society and offers advice on how 
              </i>gurukulas <i>can be improved. What duty does a </i>gurukula 
              <i>owe to its students who may choose not to be fulltime ISKCON 
              members upon reaching adulthood? And how can a better understanding 
              be reached between those who enter ISKCON by birth and those who 
              enter by choice? </i></p>
            <p>Some of what I write here may be old news. My last year in <i>gurukula 
              </i>(ISKCON's school system) <i>- </i>and really my last intimate 
              involvement with ISKCON - was in 1986, when I was fifteen years 
              old. Devotee children born then would themselves be fifteen years 
              old now. I know they have experienced a very different upbringing 
              than my peers and I. Most have not attended boarding school <i>gurukulas</i>. 
              I also know that the entire movement has changed in many ways since 
              then, and I think (and hope) that the few <i>gurukulas </i>that 
              exist, but more importantly the attitudes of ISKCON leaders, parents, 
              and educators, have changed. Still, at the risk of repeating realisations 
              that devotees may have had years ago, and with the benefit of hindsight, 
              I wish to make several things very clear that were obviously not 
              clear to the leadership, educators, parents, and members of ISKCON 
              fifteen years ago. </p>
            <p>The first of these I will call the antinomian heresy, which, while 
              a term from Christian theology and not perfectly accurate in this 
              case, is a good shorthand for the basic idea that spiritual perfection 
              places one above the law. In my youth, many devotees operated as 
              if they and ISKCON were above the law, and by this I mean not just 
              the law in a strictly legal sense but also in the sense of the basic 
              moral laws that govern civilised behaviour, especially among those 
              who claim to be religious. Many devotees seemed to have taken the 
              passages in scripture that say that anyone engaged in Krsna's service 
              is without faults and beyond reproach<sup><a href="#1a">1</a><a name="1"></a> 
              </sup>as a license to engage in, or at least look the other way 
              from, all kinds of criminal and immoral behaviour, and that this 
              was justified in the name of Krsna's service. Anyone who's been 
              around ISKCON over its lifetime will know what I'm talking about, 
              and I need only use the slang term 'scam-kirtana'<sup><a href="#2a">2</a><a name="2"></a> 
              </sup>to give you one example. </p>
            <p>Among the young children of ISKCON, this resulted in <i>gurukula 
              </i>teachers and administrators not even thinking to treat sexual 
              abuse and physical abuse as crimes. Instead, when incidents of sexual 
              abuse came to light, they were usually hidden and hushed. <i>Gurukula 
              </i>administrators seemed less concerned with the welfare of the 
              children than with the reputation of <i>gurukulas, </i>which they 
              saw as their service to Prabhupada and thus something to be protected 
              at all costs. Instead of treating sexual abuse as a crime that must 
              be reported to civil authorities, and for which the perpetrator 
              must be prosecuted, they treated the incidents as 'falldowns' that 
              could be rectified by better spiritual practice. In almost every 
              case, perpetra-tors were simply counselled to practice better <i>sadhana 
              </i>in order to reduce their sexual desires; in some cases, the 
              perpetrators were not even removed from their positions as teachers 
              but quietly transferred to another school. In my own case, and that 
              of many others, incidents that occurred in Dallas, when I was barely 
              five years old, had consequences that will affect us for all our 
              lives. Thus, from the very beginning, <i>gurukulis' </i>lives were 
              'spoiled' - to use Prabhupada's term<sup><a name="3"></a><a href="#3a">3</a> 
              </sup>- by personal exposure and the exposure of their classmates 
              to criminal sexual activity. I remember no lawful response by <i>gurukula 
              </i>or ISKCON leaders to any of this. </p>
            <p>As I mentioned, there have been many instances of what I've called 
              antinomian thinking in ISKCON's culture, and child abuse is only 
              the most egregious. As recently as last year, I was at a conference 
              in New Vrindaban in which Professor Rochford urged ISKCON to take 
              concrete institutional steps to avoid abuses of authority.<sup><a name="4"></a><a href="#4a">4</a> 
              </sup>One of the devotees in attendance insisted that the proper 
              understanding is that ultimately these things happen because of 
              spiritual defects and that, therefore, better spiritual practice 
              is the only real cure for ISKCON's problems. However, even if the 
              root causes of all our problems are spiritual in nature, I strongly 
              disagree that leaders of ISKCON should respond to crimes and immoral 
              behaviour, especially sexual and physical abuse in <i>gurukulas</i>, 
              with only a so-called spiritual prescription. </p>
            <p>When a devotee gets on an airplane, is he more concerned that the 
              pilot and crew have the proper training or that they are devotees 
              in good standing? Does a devotee ask the surgeon if he's chanted 
              his daily rounds and is strictly following the regulative principles 
              before he allows the operation? Yet, at one point in <i>gurukula's 
              </i>history, it was felt that train-ing and qualifications for teachers, 
              such as an education degree, were actually to be avoided because 
              they would only contaminate the devotee teachers with <i>karmi </i>ideas. 
              While faith cannot be discarded, it often seemed that <i>gurukula 
              </i>teachers had faith and only faith, not real plans based on practical 
              principles. They seemed convinced that everything would work out, 
              and not only work out, but that this was the best possible educational 
              experience for us, simply because they had good intentions and saw 
              themselves as working sincerely to please Prabhupada and Krsna. 
              I hope by now that ISKCON leaders, and especially parents and educators, 
              have realised that while spiritual practices like faith in guru 
              and Krsna are the important foundations of ISKCON, they cannot substitute 
              for practical intelligence and expertise. Similarly, whatever perfection 
              may result from being a devotee of the Lord, no one is above the 
              law or too good for civilised behaviour. I think even within the 
              philosophy of Krsna consciousness, a proper understanding of the 
              twenty-six qualities of a Vaisnava and the imperatives of action 
              in the mode of goodness would make that clear. </p>
            <p>I would think by now that the abuses we suffered in <i>gurukula 
              </i>are common knowledge. Some <i>gurukulas </i>and some teachers 
              were much better than others, so not everyone lived a horror story, 
              but what has been heard is not exaggeration. The tremendous difficulties 
              many former <i>gurukulis </i>have gone through, both in the <i>gurukulas 
              </i>and then later in life as they tried to come to terms with their 
              childhoods, are almost too much to bear. I personally don't want 
              to dwell on these at this time, except to say the obvious: that 
              they must never happen again. In terms of sexual abuse, there is 
              absolutely nothing in Krsna conscious philosophy that condones it. 
              I think that now that ISKCON is aware that sexual abuse does happen 
              even in a religious society, and if it diligently keeps to the standards 
              that the Child Protection Office has put in place, nothing like 
              what happened before will happen again. </p>
            <p>In terms of physical abuse, there may be some complications. ISKCON 
              educational philosophy places a great emphasis on strict discipline 
              and absolute obedience to authority. Furthermore, it involves separation 
              of children and parents, isolating the children from mainstream 
              society, requiring attendance at <i>mangala-arati </i>and the full 
              morning programme, and other practices of devotional life conducted 
              in the name of austerity (<i>tapasya</i>), such as having few possessions 
              and sleeping on simple bedding. Some of my peers have argued that 
              all these principles are inherently abusive. I disagree, but I do 
              know that these principles can and often did become abusive in the 
              hands of fanatical teachers. Thus, while physical abuse of children 
              can happen in any circumstance, ISKCON educators and parents should 
              specifically recognise that certain aspects of Krsna conscious educational 
              philosophy can easily be misapplied in an abusive manner, and they 
              must avoid repeating this at all costs. Children may wake up early 
              and attend <i>mangala-arati</i>, but they must get enough sleep; 
              some <i>gurukulas </i>were good about this, but many were not. A 
              simple lifestyle is not abusive, but lack of basic facilities and 
              affectionate, loving care, as occurred in many <i>gurukulas </i>in 
              the past, is certainly abusive. Discipline is not abusive, but beatings, 
              threats of beating, and an atmosphere of complete intimidation are 
              definitely abusive. Teachers and parents must be careful to apply 
              practical intelligence so as not to blindly follow philosophical 
              ideas to the point of fanaticism. The principle, as Prabhupada himself 
              said several times, is not to force.<sup><a href="#5a">5</a><a name="5"></a> 
              </sup>Tragically, this aspect of his instructions was largely ignored 
              by teachers and parents alike.</p>
            <p>I've heard stories that give me the impression that some devotees 
              think that <i>gurukula </i>was a great thing and everything would 
              have worked out just fine for us, but somehow 'demons' got involved 
              and abused some of the kids, and that's the reason why we're not 
              all full-time devotees and why some of us have even become antagonistic 
              toward ISKCON. I think blaming so-called 'demons' or even placing 
              all the blame on <i>gurukula </i>administrators and teachers (who 
              certainly deserve some blame) is a way to ignore institutional failings 
              and avoid self-examination.<sup><a href="#6a">6</a><a name="6"></a> 
              </sup>I suggest such devotees read Professor Rochford's 1998 article 
              'Child Abuse in the Hare Krsna Movement: 1971-1986' (Rochford 1998) 
              for an excellent sociological analysis of what happened. Like those 
              leftists who claim that the history of the Soviet Union doesn't 
              accurately reflect communism because the Soviet Union was never 
              really communist, I have some sympathy with those who see the history 
              of <i>gurukula </i>as so marred by sexual and physical abuse that 
              it tells us little about a real Krsna conscious education. At least 
              for ISKCON's sake, I hope this is the case. Nevertheless, I think 
              the leaders, parents, and educators of ISKCON must also realise 
              that graduates of even the most perfect <i>gurukula</i>, who have 
              never suffered from any form of abuse, will still have to contend 
              with a host of problems as they grow older. Nothing in <i>gurukulas 
              </i>of the past prepared us for those difficulties, and in fact, 
              the abuses of <i>gurukula </i>only made these difficulties much 
              worse. </p>
            <p>The crux of the problem is that Krsna consciousness and modern 
              culture, especially in America, are about as far apart culturally 
              as you can get. In many ways they are in direct opposition. Most 
              devotees recognise this. In fact, in becoming devotees, they specifically 
              seek an escape from modern culture, which they view as an increasingly 
              abhorrent product of Kali-yuga. Thus they enthusiastically transform 
              not only their beliefs, but every aspect of their lives - from what 
              they read, what they do, and with whom they associate to their clothing, 
              hairstyle, diet, and even their very names. </p>
            <p>I remember over the years many devotees joyfully telling me how 
              happy I must feel and how lucky I must consider myself to be a <i>gurukula 
              </i>boy. I always found that a strange comment. First of all, I 
              didn't always think it was that cool to be a <i>gurukuli </i>kid 
              subject to authoritarian rules like standing in line to go to the 
              temple, being made to wear an ugly yellow <i>dhoti, </i>being forbidden 
              to ride bikes around the farm, or not being allowed even to talk 
              to girls. But mostly I found it strange because for me this was 
              the only life I knew. I had nothing to compare it with, and in no 
              way had I chosen it. Those who joined the movement imagined <i>gurukula 
              </i>as an amazing gift, because while they had made a choice to 
              change their lives, renounce the material world and become devotees 
              of Krsna, they found so many ingrained impurities and attachments 
              within themselves. To have grown up without those impurities was 
              the stuff of their dreams, and when I look back to how really innocent 
              we all were, I guess I can understand that enthusiasm. </p>
            <p>I tell this, though, to illustrate what I believe is the most important 
              thing the educators of ISKCON should understand. They joined the 
              Hare Krsna movement by choice. They saw it all and did it all and 
              finally found their home at the feet of Prabhupada and Krsna. No 
              matter what pressures they may have experienced to 'shave up' or 
              'move in' and not to 'bloop' (drop out of ISKCON), as adults, they 
              are ultimately involved with ISKCON by choice. In fact, the whole 
              basis of surrender and devotional service in loving relationship 
              with Krsna (<i>bhakti</i>) is one of choice. Children born into 
              ISKCON, however, do not and cannot really make that choice until 
              they are independent, that is, until they reach adolescence. </p>
            <p>Before reaching adolescence, <i>gurukulis </i>are more or less 
              parrots. We dance, we sing, we chant <i>japa, </i>we recite <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>verses to impress visiting life members, we even distribute 
              books and preach the philosophy, but it is all we know. We'll even 
              get initiated, like many of my friends did, but the vows are often 
              meaningless, as time has shown. Our complete absorption in the devotee 
              lifestyle is not necessarily an expression of deep spiritual realisation 
              but simply the natural capacity of children to be inculcated in 
              their culture, be it the American one or the ISKCON one. When we 
              began to be independent, when we went from being obedient <i>gurukula 
              </i>kids to becoming free-thinking adults, the two completely dissimilar 
              cultures of ISKCON and America clashed. We had the most difficult 
              time, because no one had ever prepared us to face this. As long 
              as there is this difference between American culture and ISKCON 
              culture, each <i>gurukuli </i>(or at least American <i>gurukuli</i>) 
              will face this culture clash and the choices it brings. I hope that 
              in the future, children of ISKCON will have more help and are better 
              prepared than we were. </p>
            <p>When I graduated from the <i>gurukula </i>in Vrndavana, I had a 
              Bhakti-sastri degree, which means I knew <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and 
              other scriptures rather well. I also had some skills at reading 
              and writing, mostly developed through the study of scriptures, and 
              a smattering of Sanskrit, but I had received only the most basic 
              rudiments of the social sciences and mathematics. I had absolutely 
              no science education. I would make an outstanding temple devotee, 
              but I had no training with which to do anything else, like enter 
              college and pursue a career. It seems I was never expected to even 
              want to do that. From quotations I have read from Prabhupada, this 
              seems to me more or less what he wanted academically. Interested 
              overwhelmingly in a religious education, he specifically instructed 
              that the goal of <i>gurukula </i>was to create preachers and devotees 
              of high character and sense control, and that advanced academics 
              and higher education like university were neither desired nor required.<sup><a href="#7a">7</a><a name="7"></a> 
              </sup>So perhaps the fact that I found myself at age fifteen with 
              basically only a religious education is not a failure of <i>gurukula 
              </i>but something to be expected from <i>gurukula</i>. </p>
            <p>What does seem a clear failure is that no one seemed to know what 
              to do with us when we were done with <i>gurukula</i>. In my case, 
              when it became obvious that there was nothing more for me to learn 
              in the <i>gurukula </i>system, it was arranged that I would serve 
              as the typist for Satsvarupa Maharaja. This didn't last long, and 
              now that I understand just how difficult fifteen-year-olds can be, 
              I'm surprised that it lasted as long as it did. At the Gita-nagari 
              farm they tried to have the teenagers work as devotees (i.e. for 
              no pay), and after much strife, that too failed. No one knew what 
              to do with all these <i>gurukulis; </i>not only that, once we started 
              experimenting with the outside world, there was often outright hostility 
              toward us. It seemed no one had even considered that teenagers may 
              not want to live the life of devotee monks. I suppose they assumed 
              that since we had experienced the higher taste of love of Krsna 
              we would never want sense gratification. It was a shock that we 
              wanted to eat ice cream or watch movies and that we were fascinated 
              with American culture, what to speak of the near heart attacks we 
              caused when we engaged in those activities that potentially involved 
              breaking the regulative principles, like associating with girls. 
            </p>
            <p>I've read one of my father's (Ravindra Svarupa Dasa) articles in 
              which he describes how early devotees had no idea how to relate 
              to 'fringies', those on the fringe of ISKCON society. Well, adolescent 
              <i>gurukulis </i>were (and I think always will be) fringies with 
              a vengeance. Even to this day - for example, at our reunions - we 
              cause problems because of our fringe behaviour. One day we'll be 
              running around and swimming in our shorts and bikinis, boys and 
              girls freely mixing, listening to rock and roll or hip-hop, and 
              the next day we'll be at the Sunday programme in <i>dhotis </i>and 
              <i>saris </i>singing and dancing in the <i>kirtana</i>. No one had 
              any idea that something like this would happen, no one had any idea 
              how to respond when it did, and it seems some still don't know how 
              to respond. Everyone was scrambling - children had not grown up 
              with their parents and so parent and child didn't know each other 
              very well, temple authorities didn't know how to deal with troublemakers 
              they couldn't just kick out of the temple - and we kids were especially 
              scrambling, for we not only had to face the normal troubles of any 
              adolescent but added to that was this unbelievable clash between 
              the ISKCON culture we grew up in and the larger world that we were 
              now more or less free to enter. </p>
            <p>I believe that an upbringing that does not prepare <i>gurukula 
              </i>kids to face this dichotomy, and more than that, does not provide 
              at some point the basic academic and social build-ing blocks for 
              success in the secular world, should they choose to enter it, is 
              a disservice to ISKCON's children. Considering that Prabhupada envisioned 
              <i>gurukula </i>as ending at fifteen years of age and that the American 
              system of education continues until at least age eighteen, I think 
              there should be flexibility in the <i>gurukula </i>system, so that 
              students could maintain the strict spiritual principles of <i>gurukula 
              </i>but still not be impaired with regard to their secular future. 
              This may be a moot point since so many devotee children are now 
              being educated in secular schools and are straddling both worlds 
              from the beginning, but for my peers and me, we had to figure out 
              all this stuff more or less on our own. </p>
            <p>It was very frustrating for me that I had spent months in minute 
              study of the <i>Nectar of Devotion </i>and years memorising Sanskrit 
              grammar <i>sutras, </i>the meaning and application of which we weren't 
              taught, yet when I wanted to take the SATs for college admission, 
              I didn't know what a sine or cosine was. I feel even more for the 
              girls, so many of whom were not even given the scriptural education 
              the boys received, for at least that education taught me to read 
              and write well. Instead, they were taught that their only worth 
              was as an obedi-ent wife, that academics and philosophy were over 
              their heads, and they would be better off learning to cook, sew, 
              and clean. The simple fact, which may now seem obvious but was evidently 
              not even imagined in the past, is that, given the renunciation required, 
              relatively few <i>gurukulis </i>are going to end up being full-time 
              temple devotees. Therefore, at some point they will need to receive 
              the education and social tools to allow them to live and work in 
              the secular world if they choose to do so. </p>
            <p>As far as this choice is concerned, I think it is important to 
              note that this will most likely be an issue between the adolescent 
              and the parents. In the past, one of the problems was that parent/child 
              relationships were neglected, and this made things all the more 
              difficult when we reached adolescence. There was an absolute insistence 
              by <i>gurukula </i>authorities that all ISKCON children had to be 
              separated from their parents while in <i>gurukula</i>, even when 
              some children and parents clearly should not have been apart. In 
              some cases, <i>gurukula </i>authorities even actively kept children 
              and their parents from communicating, because they thought the parents 
              were too much <i>maya</i>. I also wish the parents had not been 
              so quick to go along with the authorities' demands when their children 
              were clearly unhappy in <i>gurukula</i>. Even if we accept that 
              a boarding school <i>(asrama</i>) education under the daily care 
              of a guru is the best for a spiritual education, it seems obvious 
              that a child's relationship with his or her parents cannot be neglected 
              or given second-class status. A child cannot be more or less abandoned 
              to be raised by an <i>asrama </i>teacher. In my own case, even though 
              I spent more time between five and fifteen years of age in the <i>asrama 
              </i>than I did with my parents, and as much as those experiences 
              and teachers have shaped me, my connection to my parents is more 
              visceral and enduring and means much more to me, both then and now, 
              than my connection with <i>gurukula</i>. If my parents had been 
              less involved with my life while I was in <i>gurukula</i>, or if 
              they had reacted to my choices as I grew older with hostility or 
              resentment - if they had not been forgiving, open-minded, and supportive 
              as I made my choices and ultimately became my own person - I would 
              have had an incredibly more difficult time. When an adolescent leaves 
              <i>gurukula, </i>especially if he or she chooses to leave the community 
              of ISKCON, that person's only real connection in life, and to Krsna 
              consciousness as well, will be with the parents. Thus, whatever 
              the philosophical principle of rising above bodily attachment, I 
              believe a child's relationship with his or her parents cannot be 
              neglected or diminished, even if, or perhaps especially if, the 
              child goes to a boarding school. </p>
            <p>Another issue of choice that every adolescent <i>gurukuli </i>will 
              face is sexuality and relationships between the sexes. I remember 
              my last year in <i>gurukula, </i>when I was fifteen - and I hope 
              you remember what it is like to be that age - one of my teachers 
              discovered I had a crush on a certain girl. He gave me a little 
              lecture, telling me, 'Don't get involved with </p>
            <p>girls. They'll only bring you trouble'. Whether he was right or 
              wrong, that particular instruction was out the other ear in record 
              time. I wanted nothing more than exactly that kind of trouble. Now, 
              I don't want to argue that ISKCON has to change its principles and 
              condone illicit sex. Prabhupada clearly wanted strict <i>brahmacarya, 
              </i>and celibacy is of course a very important spiritual practice. 
              However, I think that it is a problem that my teacher's only option 
              seemed to be to tell me, 'No, you can't'. I suppose he could have 
              arranged my marriage, but considering that, if I am not mistaken, 
              one hundred percent of the marriages of young <i>gurukulis </i>have 
              already ended, I don't think that marriage at that time would necessarily 
              have been a better choice. I might add that those early marriages 
              between young <i>gurukulis </i>occurred because the girls 'had' 
              to get married immediately; I suppose the boys were expected to 
              remain celibate until they were twenty-four or twenty-five. Celibacy 
              or marriage seems to be the only options and, even when attempting 
              marriage, I know many <i>gurukulis </i>who couldn't stand the nosy 
              fishbowl of a small ISKCON community. I must admit I have no solution 
              to this problem, but I also understand that ISKCON is not the only 
              religious com-munity to face it. However, because American culture 
              practically celebrates dating and premarital relations, I want to 
              emphasise that this is a major part of that vastly complex choice 
              that devotee adolescents will face. Perhaps a little more tolerance 
              and understanding than we were shown will go a long way toward not 
              alienating future <i>gurukulis. </i></p>
            <p>The fact that we were allowed no contact with girls whatsoever 
              made our adolescence, and especially our first forays into the wider 
              world, that much more awkward and difficult. American boys and girls 
              relate with each other throughout their lives, and in the secular 
              world of work and school, men and women relate with each other all 
              the time, and it is not always with sex on the brain. The fact that 
              boys and girls coming out of <i>gurukula </i>have absolutely no 
              idea how to relate with members of the opposite sex is an added 
              burden. America is not a village society in which only a limited 
              number of boys and girls will ever be potential mates for each other, 
              in which all the families know each other, in which the roles of 
              the sexes are exclusively defined, and in which common societal 
              obligations outweigh personal desires. America is a much more complicated 
              social scene, and if ISKCON children enter that world, how are they 
              going to be prepared for it? As it was, we often became sneaky and 
              hypocritical, because most of us did find ways to at least talk 
              to girls, and we went through all kinds of other tribulations and 
              embarrassments, boys and girls alike, when we were finally exposed 
              to the wider world. Again, I don't have an easy answer. I would 
              just like you to understand that this is a difficulty that all ISKCON 
              teenagers will face, and it would be helpful if ISKCON parents and 
              educators understood that and planned for it in some way. </p>
            <p>I have been criticising my <i>gurukula </i>upbringing, but now 
              I would like to share what I think was valuable about it. Of course, 
              from a Krsna conscious perspective, there's no question of the priceless 
              value of even the most minor association with Krsna, His holy name, 
              and His devotees, what to speak of being given the fortunate opportunity 
              to begin this rare human life as a devotee. However, I would like 
              to address this from the perspective of someone who has made the 
              choice to enter the secular world, to become sometimes more American 
              than devotee, and to reject some of the spiritual values I was taught, 
              at least for a time. In other words, what do I feel I gained from 
              <i>gurukula, </i>which is essentially a religious education, even 
              though I have left the religious movement? </p>
            <p>The most obvious thing is that <i>gurukula </i>made us tough. Especially 
              those of us who had gone to <i>gurukula </i>in India felt that since 
              we'd survived that, we could take anything - sleep anywhere, make 
              do with whatever - and not let it get to us. I remember when I decided 
              to become a pilot and joined the Civil Air Patrol, which is a US 
              Air Force auxiliary search and rescue organisation that teenagers 
              can join. (They will even teach you to fly if you stay around long 
              enough.) The Pennsylvania Civil Air Patrol has a ten-day programme 
              called Summer Hawk, which is a kind of eased-down basic training 
              and wilderness survival camp in the Pocono Mountains. Many kids 
              couldn't take being yelled at, or they missed their parents, but 
              none of that even fazed me. Even the real military training I later 
              received never really fazed me. I knew how to obey orders; I knew 
              how to make do with few comforts; I had been yelled at by people 
              who I had seen hit kids with impunity. I knew the drill instructor 
              couldn't do that, what to speak of the older kids in the Civil Air 
              Patrol trying to imitate drill instructors. A lot of us <i>gurukulis 
              </i>felt and feel this pride, and in a way it is a direct result 
              of the austerities we faced. Many of our austerities were just experiencing 
              the standard of living that is fairly normal for countries like 
              India. In many ways we had received an education in how much of 
              the world lives, and I personally consider that something valuable 
              to know as I now live in the relative luxury of the United States. 
              Don't get me wrong. It was often scary, like when I was seriously 
              ill in a hospital in Mathura, and I was often homesick, and one 
              certainly can't forget the overwhelming context of abuses. But I 
              survived it, and I believe I'm stronger for it. </p>
            <p>Another thing I treasure from my upbringing is music, especially 
              drumming. Without really realising it at the time, I had an excellent 
              foundation for becoming a musician. Every day I played <i>mrdanga 
              </i>and sang in the <i>kirtanas</i>. It seems that skills like that 
              become second nature the more they are practiced in the crucial 
              years of cognitive development before age twelve, and while artistic 
              development is a life-long quest, I have been blessed with a head 
              start in certain skills. It is one of my greatest pleasures to play 
              music with people, and I can thank my upbringing for opening that 
              door for me. Many of my peers, too, find pleasure and fulfilment 
              in similar artistic endeavours. </p>
            <p>Earlier, I mentioned the vast difference, almost complete opposition, 
              between ISKCON culture and American culture. As an adolescent living 
              in America after leaving <i>gurukula, </i>I found this difference 
              very embarrassing. I had no knowledge or any idea about how to relate 
              to American culture. I had none of the 'culture specific' skills 
              (to use a term from sociology), and I basically went on a crash 
              course in American culture. I watched hours of television, rented 
              hundreds of movies, started listening to top-forty radio, slowly 
              made some non-devotee friends in the Civil Air Patrol, got a job, 
              and eventually started attending the local community college. I 
              felt very lonely and really just wanted to be a normal American 
              teenager, just like most adolescents who want to fit in somehow.<sup><a href="#8a">8</a><a name="8"></a> 
              </sup>In many ways I was resentful that my parents had joined the 
              movement and raised me so differently, and I remember thinking that 
              if I wasn't able to get into college and become a Naval officer 
              so I could fly jet planes, if my upbringing had ruined my chances 
              at this dream of mine, I would hold a lifelong grudge against my 
              parents and ISKCON. </p>
            <p>Fifteen years later I don't hold that grudge at all; what is more, 
              in many ways I have come to treasure the differences that I once 
              despised. Even if I don't apply them or have complete faith in them, 
              the beliefs and ideas that were my first philosophy give me ways 
              to analyse the world and to try to understand life that most Americans 
              cannot really conceive. The understanding of the soul and how it 
              transmigrates, the interactions of the modes of nature, the philosophy 
              of simultaneous oneness with and difference from God, the intricacies 
              of developing a loving relationship with God, what to speak of the 
              wealth of stories that are certainly among the world's greatest 
              literature, are all gifts of my upbringing. Now that I'm not so 
              frightened to be different and am as comfortable living in American 
              culture as I used to be in ISKCON culture, these differences are 
              almost what define me. This tension between American culture and 
              ISKCON culture and this almost dance I do on the edges of both are 
              in many ways who I am. I don't really want to become all American, 
              but neither do I want be a full-time devotee. </p>
            <p>You may have noticed that what I consider the valuable things from 
              my <i>gurukula </i>education are all related to my familiarity with 
              a culture different from America's. Only a few months ago, when 
              I had first heard of plans for this conference, Citralekha Dasi, 
              one of my classmate's mothers and a staff member of ISKCON Communications, 
              recommended a book called <i>The Third Culture Kid Experience: Growing 
              Up Among Worlds, </i>by David C. Pollock and Ruth E. Van Reken. 
              Reading that book was a great comfort, not so much because it gave 
              me a lot of new information - it was more like reading a great presentation 
              of many of my own disorganised and scattered thoughts - but because 
              it was very comforting to realise that many people around the world 
              straddle cultures the way <i>gurukulis </i>do, and it seems we all 
              have similar issues. In a way, I already knew this. My best friends 
              in life have almost always been third culture kids, from my former 
              classmates in <i>gurukula, </i>with whom I feel the strongest bonds, 
              even when I don't see them for years, to my college roommate, who 
              had attended high school in Quito, Ecuador, to my girlfriend, who 
              grew up in East Berlin until she was fifteen years old. I think 
              this idea of a third culture will be incredibly useful for parents, 
              educators, and children of ISKCON to understand. I think that even 
              if <i>gurukulis </i>later reject the religious and spiritual aspects 
              of their upbringing, they may still find value in it if (to use 
              the language of the book) they manage to meet the challenges and 
              embrace the benefits of being third culture kids. </p>
            <p>I initially wanted to write this without quoting Prabhupada, and 
              just give my opinions about what academics and social life should 
              be like for <i>gurukulis, </i>based on the lessons from my own upbringing. 
              However, an essential aspect of <i>gurukula </i>is the instructions 
              of the guru. In that respect, the instructions of Prabhupada will 
              remain a guiding principle of <i>gurukula </i>education, and I think 
              it is as fundamental an American right as any other that ISKCON 
              can pursue this religious vision, as long as it doesn't break the 
              law. However, as I argued in the beginning, this spiritual pursuit 
              must be done with practical intelligence, wisdom, kindness, and 
              love. In the same presentation in New Vrindaban that I mentioned 
              earlier, Dr. Rochford made the suggestion that while ISKCON devotees 
              have been good at studying and repeating the instructions of Prabhupada, 
              they have not really learned to apply his wisdom.<sup><a href="#9a">9</a><a name="9"></a> 
              </sup>To make that same point - and just for a change of pace, to 
              argue the way devotees argue - I wish to relate a story that appears 
              in a book written by one of my former teachers: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Once, on the Hyderabad farm during a morning walk, Srila Prabhupada 
                was asked whether a particular <i>mantra </i>could be chanted 
                within the temple. Srila Prabhupada's reply was that there was 
                nothing wrong with the <i>mantra</i>, but our principle should 
                be not to change anything. Yet, on another occasion, while he 
                was taking his massage in Melbourne during 1975, I heard Srila 
                Prabhupada explain the reason for his success in preaching in 
                the West as allowing women to live within the temples of the Krsna 
                consciousness movement. He then laughed and said that his Godbrothers 
                criticised him for the change, but that they were unsuccessful. 
                'And the only time they have some attendance is during <i>parikramas 
                </i>on Gaura-purnima in Mayapura. And who attends? Women. Old 
                widows in white.' He laughed. 'And because I made this adjustment,' 
                Srila Prabhupada continued, 'I was successful'. </p>
              <p>Srila Prabhupada's servant then asked an intelligent question. 
                'Prabhupada', he inquired, 'how do know the difference between 
                making an adjustment and changing the principles?' On hearing 
                this, Prabhupada closed his eyes in concentration for several 
                moments. When his eyes opened, Prabhupada gravely answered, 'That 
                requires a little intelligence'. (Bhurijana Dasa, p. 50) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I would like to close with one last reference, and that is to a 
              paper by Raghunatha Anudasa, one of the older <i>gurukulis, </i>entitled 
              'Prabhupada's Magic: Cure for ISKCON Child Abuse'.<sup><a href="#10a">10</a><a name="10"></a> 
              </sup>He wrote this as a response to Dr. Rochford's 1998 paper on 
              child abuse in the Hare Krsna movement, and also as a defense of 
              Prabhupada himself. In this paper, Raghunatha recounts his personal 
              experiences with Prabhupada, and he concludes that Prabhupada had 
              a magic, namely, that he treated each person as an individual and 
              somehow made them feel special. </p>
            <p>From what I remember of the philosophy of Krsna consciousness, 
              the great enemy of devotees of Krsna in the tradition of Lord Caitanya 
              is impersonalism. The very goal of all devo-tional spiritual practices 
              is to develop an individual loving relationship with Krsna. A similar 
              loving relationship is supposed to develop with one's guru, with 
              other devotees, and, in fact, with every living entity. Somehow 
              or another, in the history of <i>gurukula</i>, and even ISKCON at 
              large, loving relationships have been sorely lacking. Too often, 
              instead of having loving personal relationships, with all the give 
              and take, compassion and understanding they involve, those in authority 
              have had destructive and even abusive personal relationships, or 
              have been impersonal in their dealings by expecting every devotee 
              to fit in the same box. I hope that with intelligence, and by developing 
              loving personal relationships, the devotees of ISKCON, especially 
              the leaders and parents, can avoid the terrible blunders of the 
              past and realise the glorious potential one hopes Krsna consciousness 
              can bring. </p>
