            <p class="maintextsubhead">Prajyumna Kafle </p>
            <p>When I look around and see children happily running across the 
              temple grounds, I sometimes wonder if the things I endured as a 
              child in this same ISKCON really happened. I feel reality is suspended 
              because, although I was a Hare Krsna boy just like a lot of youngsters 
              growing up in the movement today, my personal experience seems so 
              different from theirs. I struggle trying to see my experience through 
              the eyes of an outsider so that I can tell what I went through in 
              simple language. </p>
            <p>Leaving the Hare Krsna setting was like having to change from diesel 
              to petrol. I had to switch to a completely different way of thinking 
              to fuel my motivation. I suppose I just wasn't pure enough to continue 
              to try to do everything to please Krsna after I left the temple. 
              That whole way of reasoning just didn't make sense in the outside 
              world while trying to fend for myself and get an education. Looking 
              back, seeing the naivety I took with me as I walked out of the communal 
              setting, it's amazing in some ways that I lived to tell the tale. 

            </p>
            <p>I was taught that Krsna consciousness should be the broadest of 
              all viewpoints, not the narrowest. It is a viewpoint that should 
              never become irrelevant, no matter what disci-plines I enter for 
              practical life. But I found I understood little of the world by 
              looking through the lens I had been taught to use. Instead of illuminating 
              my vision, I felt reality was so narrowly defined that I was restricted 
              from seeing major parts of it. I initially rejected my Hare Krsna 
              way of thinking in order to mix with the outside world. Eventually, 
              experience and philosophical reasoning showed me that it wasn't 
              an 'either/or' situation in which I had to reject one viewpoint 
              to accept another. It was just a question of broadening my vision 
              to encompass both worlds. I didn't understand why my authorities 
              didn't concentrate more on helping me to see the whole picture. 
              Our philosophy is broad enough to embrace everyone's point of view 
              without causing anyone to feel threatened by another's existence 
              or lifestyle. I wish the focus had been more on this than on insulting 
              and putting down people whose lifestyles were different from our 
              own. In my upbringing in ISKCON, I gained the impression that devotees 
              had a very egotistical view of goodness. It seemed that if goodness 
              did not ultimately come from a 'devotee' then it was not worth appreciating. 
              When introducing children to Krsna consciousness, devotees need 
              to be careful that out of their enthusiasm they don't misinterpret 
              the philosophy and hinder their children. I feel that overprotecting 
              children from exposure to the real world because of a phobia that 
              they may succumb to illusion can stifle a child's emotional growth. 
            </p>
            <p>It is easier now, as an outsider, to see this visceral fear and 
              to expose it. But when you're a dependent child in the tight grip 
              of the Hare Krsna movement, it's a difficult knot to cut and hard 
              to protest against. The institution starts with a stringent philosophy 
              that has a philosophical rebuttal for any counter-argument. Combine 
              that foundation with spiritual authorities who, according to the 
              book, can be questioned but in all practicality often have mammoth 
              egos that are easily threatened by penetrating, persistent questions; 
              mix in a dash of nudging peer pressure from your older temple-mates 
              who may also be your Godbrothers or Godsisters, and you may well 
              question who is there to encourage the personal develop-ment of 
              the lone individual in this institutional quagmire. </p>
            <p>This is the reason why, when I occasionally meet people who are 
              interested in my spiritual beliefs, I hesitate to send them to a 
              Hare Krsna temple for the answers. Personally, I can now enjoy the 
              positive spiritual result of visiting an ISKCON temple without feeling 
              my individuality threatened too much, but I wouldn't want to be 
              responsible for sending a neophyte to the Hare Krsna movement without 
              some 'adult supervision'. I do not feel there is a high enough standard 
              of uniform care offered to visitors for me to feel assured that 
              my guest would be treated properly everywhere. I'd hate to see another 
              innocent individual who had finally gathered the guts to seek spirituality 
              be given a raw deal at the hands of a mismanaged ISKCON facility. 
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Growing up in an authoritarian structure 
            </p>
            <p>As I grew up in ISKCON, I was fed an attitude of such awe and reverence 
              for the untouchable position of my spiritual authorities that I 
              could not even question them when they started to influence and 
              be intimately involved in my personal life. They intervened in decisions 
              of family, marriage, education and future; all, of course, in the 
              name of Krsna consciousness and for my 'ultimate benefit'. They 
              had a 'transcendental' answer to defend all their intentions, and 
              my intellectually under-nourished teenage mind did not have the 
              savvy to battle effectively with their answers and superior position 
              without becoming emotionally charged. As the slightest outbreak 
              to defend myself was construed as being spiritually offensive, I 
              learned to keep my emotions under check lest I be punished by the 
              wrath of God Himself for raising my eyebrows at the intentions of 
              His purest souls (my ISKCON authorities). </p>
            <p>I don't think many people can understand the indelible mark that 
              was etched in my mind when those I wholeheartedly trusted for my 
              material and spiritual welfare tried to bind me to a life of spiritual 
              slavery by attempting to cripple my mind by misapplying their so-called 
              spiritual philosophy. </p>
            <p>I was admonished over claims I made for my future survival. When 
              I talked about higher education, I repeatedly heard things like, 
              'Who has gone back to Godhead by going to college? Don't you believe 
              that Krsna will protect you and maintain you?' </p>
            <p>I heard one guru say to his teenage disciple, 'I never went to 
              college. Do you think I lack in any way?' When a spiritual master 
              whom you worship as being perfect asks such a question, what is 
              the correct answer? </p>
            <p>I felt that the gist of my training at the temple was to make me 
              dependent on the institution. If they couldn't make me dependent 
              by gaining my voluntary acceptance of a Hare Krsna temple lifestyle, 
              then they sought to make me unfit for any other career. </p>
            <p>At the age of fifteen I was not yet sophisticated enough to effectively 
              mask my personal interests with a veneer of spirituality so that 
              my desires would be seen as socially acceptable in ISKCON. My attempts 
              to deal with these issues left me drained and confused. As a survival 
              mechanism, I wrote to clarify my thoughts. The following excerpt 
              from those journals illustrates my view of ISKCON when I first walked 
              out: 'True, Vaisnava-aparadha is a killer and we should all avoid 
              it. But also, people who are wrong should not be allowed to get 
              away with murder in the name of the victims practicing <i>titiksava-karunika 
              </i>(tolerance).' </p>
            <p>Although ISKCON has been forced over the years to develop better 
              responses to counteract corruption in its ranks, there is still 
              a lot of subtle corruption that slips by due to politics. Of course, 
              no organisation is free from corruption, but we should be honest 
              about our leaders and understand that they may be less than perfect. 
              They may be sincere, and even good-willed, but they are not all 
              pure devotees whose mistakes can be written off as some sort of 
              'spiritual pastime'. Although we say the system of checks and balances 
              in Vaisnava society is guru, <i>sastra</i>, and <i>sadhu</i>, I 
              personally haven't seen it used very effectively in ISKCON. </p>
            <p>The fact remains that if a guru is one of the institutional leaders 
              and has enough influence among the '<i>sadhus</i>' (read, 'other 
              gurus, senior managers, devotees in general, etc.'), then he can 
              interpret <i>sastra </i>to suit his needs with relative impunity. 
              The result of this was that the Hare Krsna temple started to resemble 
              George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>. When someone left ISKCON, sick 
              of the whimsical emotional molestation, they were awarded the title 
              of 'blooped', and their claims and grievances were lumped with and 
              lost amongst all the other 'insincere and offensive' voices on the 
              internet. </p>
            <p>For practical purposes, ISKCON needs an effective system of checks 
              and balances. The US government has judicial, executive and legislative 
              branches. Perhaps ISKCON could have something resembling it. This 
              way, issues might be dealt with responsibly without devotees going 
              through the trauma of being torn while treading the sensitive and 
              narrow line between fearing damnation for being 'offensive' to spiritual 
              authorities (by questioning them) and attempting to find the justice 
              they deserve. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Getting away from the Hare Krsnas </p>
            <p>My personal space was violated so badly that I did not want anything 
              to do with the Hare Krsna movement. Getting away from the Hare Krsnas 
              was not a luxury for me, it was a necessity. I needed to develop 
              an identity that had nothing to do with them. Until I left ISKCON, 
              I was emotionally dependent on their validation of my identity. 
              I felt the devotees had a monopoly over my perception of reality, 
              and I was scared of that. Nobody likes to see that other people 
              have that much power over their life. </p>
            <p>After years of slowly training me on heavy philosophy, ISKCON authorities 
              had a deep control over my ideology. I felt they used that power 
              to secure their own permanent posi-tions as masters of my existence. 
              My identity had become inexorably linked with them. </p>
            <p>There are qualities like love, goodness, knowledge, and beauty 
              that a human naturally seeks. Being young and inexperienced, I had 
              let them define what these positive experiences were to be in my 
              life. They explained that there is no means of attaining true happiness 
              in life except on this path; they then linked those best and highest 
              qualities with their own per-sonalities. 'We are the custodians 
              of pure devotional service. Everything else is <i>maya </i>[illusion]<i>. 
              </i>Everyone else is trying to lead you to hell.' Looking for support 
              outside of the world of their construction and control was vehemently 
              characterised as a futile effort. So no matter what happened and 
              how they treated you, and despite the fact that your spiritual authorities 
              gave you a raw deal, emotionally you had to go back to the Hare 
              Krsna movement and surrender to the same personalities or lose your 
              spiritual identity - perhaps forever. </p>
            <p>I hear about the harmful effects of television and advertising 
              on minds. In ISKCON, our minds were subject to advertising from 
              one single station every waking hour, seven days a week, year after 
              year. Talk about a monopoly on our mental media! Imagine, for a 
              moment, the effort and knowledge it takes to undo that type of constant 
              input and then to finally think original thoughts that naturally 
              come to your head. </p>
            <p>I learned through experience that it was not enough to simply see 
              that spiritual principles were not taught properly. As one struggles 
              to establish the correct definition of things, it is very hard to 
              adjust the programming of the mind. This programming runs so deep 
              within us that if we don't take the time to redefine it in a positive 
              manner, then we unconsciously lapse into the old way of thinking 
              because that is the only deeper existence we have affirmed. For 
              me, this meant that I had to take the time to do the 'unmentionable', 
              namely, use my imperfect senses and conditioned mind to redefine 
              what was to be valued in my life. As I did this, for the first time 
              I took account of my newly found awareness of the greater world 
              around me. </p>
            <p>It is very difficult to mentally untangle oneself from a philosophy 
              that teaches that guru, a personal God, scripture, and Vaisnavas 
              are inextricably linked together as objects of worship. With a personal 
              God, not only do you have all the hurdles associated with clearing 
              your thoughts of intellectual inconsistencies but you also have 
              to put your own relationship with God (as you understood it) on 
              the line to discover the truth about your greater existence. You 
              must move cautiously so as not to offend Krsna. You are painfully 
              aware that you may be risking your eternal relationship with Him 
              by casting any doubts on His spiritual representatives (your spiritual 
              authorities). You foray into uncharted territory by questioning 
              and challenging the intentions of the very people who taught you 
              to love Him. This exercise is fraught with emotional extremes. </p>
            <p>Over and above the philosophical implications, it was very painful 
              to acknowledge that those you had trusted to have the best interest 
              of humanity in mind felt no compunction in sacrificing your best 
              interests in order to further their own spiritual careers. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Distinguishing the transcendental from 
              the mundane in ISKCON </p>
            <p>An outsider may ask why I didn't reject the whole gamut of experiences 
              instead of going through the trouble of distinguishing the transcendental 
              from the mundane in ISKCON. The fact is that there is no way I could 
              honestly and effectively cut myself off without hating myself for 
              killing a very deep part of my identity that I respect as a spiritual 
              person. To reject that identity would be to reject a whole world 
              of valuable experiences. There is also an often ignored danger of 
              loving those spiritual experiences too much. It can mean that a 
              neophyte who is too attached to that bliss can easily fall prey 
              to spiritual monopolists who know how to work the system in their 
              own favour. </p>
            <p>Although I experienced many doubts, I had been attached to chanting 
              and had been chanting a regular number of rounds. When I started 
              to realise my mental predicament I forced myself to stop chanting 
              and began looking for alternative paths of spirituality. Unfortunately 
              (or fortunately), I couldn't find any. After some time, when I felt 
              I had distanced myself enough from my dependant identity to know 
              who I was and who I wanted to be, I resumed chanting. It gives me 
              a great sense of power today to continue to chant Hare Krsna as 
              I had been taught by my authorities, but now knowing that I do it 
              for personal reasons, not because I am being manipulated by the 
              self-serving doctrines of others. </p>
            <p>On a sadder note, I find it difficult to approach and reconcile 
              Prabhupada's books after having seen them misinterpreted so often. 
              When I start to read, those caked thoughts that for so many years 
              had served as the foundation of my convoluted thinking come back 
              to haunt me. Sometimes I hurriedly shut the book. The threat of 
              having my mind suffocated once again and jumbled up with someone's 
              manipulative philosophy makes it not worth the trouble to try and 
              understand the deeper, eternal message of <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and 
              <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>. </p>
            <p>My experience is not unique. Certain aspects of <i>sadhana </i>(like 
              <i>japa </i>or <i>kirtana</i>) are still anathema to many <i>gurukulis 
              </i>who haven't been able to disassociate themselves from the negative 
              emotions linked with those activities. I'm sure time and effort 
              will heal this. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Three stages of life: restriction, generalisation, 
              and specialisation </p>
            <p>As I look back at my struggle to analyse my life and fix myself 
              on my own path, I see that when making the big decisions of our 
              life, like choosing a career, education, mate, and religious faith, 
              there are three stages we go through. </p>
            <p><i>Restriction </i></p>
            <p>First is the stage of restriction, where we don't know what we 
              want in the greater world because of a lack of exposure to life's 
              options. In this stage we observe our immediate environment in very 
              personal, unique and individual units and do not conceptualise any 
              similarities with a greater reality. At this stage we may acknowledge 
              that we need to gather more information as we seek to understand 
              our relationship with the greater world. </p>
            <p><i>Generalisation </i></p>
            <p>Then we go through the process of generalisation. Here, we are 
              like a bee tasting from each flower in the garden. For me, this 
              stage is akin to the first twelve years of school and two years 
              of college, where we're exposed to many subjects but don't specify 
              a major area of study. Through our broader dealings in the state 
              of generalisation, we may be able to find a shared definition of 
              those experiences that we previously categorised as private and 
              exclusive. We may no longer whimsically and sentimentally restrict 
              the definition of our identity by the preferences of the group of 
              people that we were born among. We may feel closer to the conceptions 
              of those people in the rest of the world that share and desire views 
              that are common to all normal and healthy human beings. </p>
            <p><i>Specialisation </i></p>
            <p>The mature fruit of generalisation is specialisation. When your 
              mind is stretched to the point at which you consider all the things 
              you could identify yourself with, you realise your own limitations 
              in the material world. You realise that the world isn't getting 
              any 'newer' by your jumping into new environments, religions, relationships 
              and careers. Being a jack-of-all-trades without making a commitment 
              starts to have diminishing returns. </p>
            <p>As we stand at the crossroads and observe all the choices we can 
              pursue, we have the potential of being able to objectively measure 
              the pros and cons in pursuing each life choice. While acting in 
              generalisation, we may also have observed recurring patterns of 
              preference in our own dealings that help us to conceptualise and 
              determine our own psychophysical nature. At this point, we may be 
              ready to settle for what suits our personality and circumstance 
              rather than continue to swim in the thinness and uncertainty of 
              generalisation. </p>
            <p><i>Working through the stages progressively </i></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, zeal may send us right back to the restriction stage 
              from which we started. There are times that we immaturely assume 
              that we want to jump to specialisation without taking the adequate 
              steps of generalisation (for example, deciding to be a <i>brahmacari 
              </i>for life, taking <i>sannyasa </i>at a young age, choosing <i>pujari 
              </i>for a lifetime career, marrying the first girl/boy you meet). 
              We might find that as life goes on that these 'career' choices restrict 
              the natural expression of our full individual personality. We realise 
              later that we had neither the knowledge nor maturity to make that 
              type of commitment. As Sri Krsna puts it: 'What will artificially 
              repressing yourself accomplish?' Realising this after making lifelong 
              commit-ments can have disastrous consequences for the individual 
              and for the society, as seen, for example, in the number of divorces 
              and <i>sannyasi </i>falldowns in ISKCON. </p>
            <p>I think that except for a exalted few personalities like Sankaracarya, 
              who took <i>sannyasa </i>at age five, and Sukadeva Goswami, who 
              took <i>sannyasa </i>right after birth, most of us should take the 
              long trial and error route through all three stages of personal 
              development and life choices. </p>
            <p>The parents of today's <i>gurukulis </i>went through all three 
              stages. They started off in restriction like everyone does at the 
              beginning of their lives. But the important difference between ISKCON 
              parents and their children is that the parents went through the 
              process of generalisation, in which they experimented with different 
              lifestyles and religions, before they came upon ISKCON. By the time 
              they came upon Srila Prabhupada's movement they had some experience 
              through the stages of generalisation and so had the confidence to 
              make the commitment to specialise in Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p>By trying to get their children to accept the Krsna conscious lifestyle 
              instead of giving them the time and space to observe other options 
              and letting them choose for themselves, parents display their own 
              lack of faith in the idea that the inherent beauty of Krsna consciousness 
              will attract everyone. They also insult their own children by not 
              giving them the credit of having enough intelligence to appreciate 
              that which is most attractive to everybody else. </p>
            <p>In a more positive light, parents must have thought that children 
              born into Krsna consciousness were fortunate that they didn't have 
              to go through the search that they themselves had undertaken. <i>Gurukulis 
              </i>were lauded for being born directly into the perfect faith. 
              In an effort to avoid the loss of time and the risk of losing their 
              kids in the chaos of generalisation, our leaders and parents forced 
              us to jump over that stage into the specialisation stage by becoming 
              fulltime preachers and <i>pujaris</i>. But in doing so, a very important 
              part of human development - exercising our free will to make our 
              own choices based on our own understanding of life's options - was 
              repressed. What did that repression accomplish? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Am I initiated? </p>
            <p>People ask me if I am initiated. I ask myself the same question. 
              Am I initiated? Is an indentured servant who is bound to his master 
              at fifteen considered a willing employee? Should a girl who was 
              married at twelve consider herself a wife? </p>
            <p>In business law there is a statute that relates to minors: 'Any 
              contract entered with a person who is under the age of 18 is to 
              be considered void because he is not considered to be mature enough 
              to enter into such dealings'. </p>
            <p>If even ordinary law can recognise that a minor is not mature enough 
              to be bound to contracts, how can ISKCON allow gurus to recruit 
              minors and initiate them? When a minor is considered unfit for a 
              temporary material contract, how can he be bound by a lifelong spiritual 
              contract? If I were to be cynical and look through the eyes of the 
              initiator, it actually appears quite ingenious: get them while they're 
              young, before their thinking has fully matured, and you've just 
              ensured yourself some very faithful disciples for the rest of your 
              life. </p>
            <p>On reflection, when I consider my future advancement in Krsna consciousness 
              this thought comes up in my mind: One cannot advance without the 
              guru, but if advancing spiritually means having to open up and forcing 
              myself to trust some of the spiritual authorities of my past, then 
              I'm sorry but I would rather not work to go back to Godhead in this 
              lifetime. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">So why do I still want to be a devotee? 
            </p>
            <p>I don't know how many people can relate to this, but today, as 
              I live an independent life and practice Krsna consciousness and 
              expose myself to other good things in life, I feel very fortunate 
              to be living a life that I almost lost. My life wasn't threatened 
              physically. Rather, I feel that it was very insidiously challenged 
              by an attempt to mentally trap me into misunderstanding what spiritual 
              freedom is. </p>
            <p>People have asked me why, despite all this, do I still chant Hare 
              Krsna and want to be a devotee? The reason is that I don't want 
              to give the power to other human beings to make me hate God because 
              of their misrepresentation of Him. </p>
            <p>I feel that with every step I take, both in ISKCON and outside 
              of it, I am rebuilding my life. I am redefining my spiritual life 
              without any help from those people who told me that I could never 
              have a worthwhile life without their blessings. This gives me a 
              lot of self-confidence and faith in both the positive values of 
              human life and in the objectivity of Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p>Though I do not want to minimise the gravity of our negative experiences, 
              I'd like to take some time to appreciate the more enjoyable aspects 
              of growing up within ISKCON. </p>
            <p>Despite everything, I cannot thank ISKCON enough for allowing me 
              to grow up in it. I really do treasure the innocence of that time. 
              On the extremes there was fanaticism and naivety, but, on a more 
              positive side, there was also sincerity and encouragement to be 
              good devotees. </p>
            <p>I graduated from <i>gurukula </i>about six years ago. I think the 
              current quality of education has improved dramatically and that 
              I had a healthier educational experience than the older <i>gurukulis 
              </i>had. <i>Gurukula </i>was a big relief from the superficiality 
              and crime of public school education. </p>
            <p>As kids who grew up in ISKCON, I feel fortunate that we are part 
              of an international spiritual culture and have a home and a family 
              in almost every country of the world. If we go to a new place, we 
              just need to go to the temple to realign ourselves with our roots. 
              The beauty of spirituality, like the deities, holy name, <i>kirtana</i>, 
              <i>prasadam </i>and devotee association are universally accessible 
              through our association with ISKCON. </p>
            <p>Today I have too many responsibilities in the outside world to 
              renounce everything to live in a temple, but I'm glad I took full 
              advantage of that opportunity when I was given the chance. I don't 
              know where I would go, or if I would even know to search for such 
              an experience, had I not been brought in contact with it. Nowhere 
              else have I experienced that special joy I felt while practicing 
              Krsna consciousness in a strict and austere setting. </p>
            <p>I am grateful that in my youth, spirituality had a chance to touch 
              and penetrate my heart. The paradigm shift that the spiritual influence 
              has given me cannot be easily denied. </p>
            <p>Even though I may find myself in different corners of this material 
              world dealing with all sorts of people, having devotee friends and 
              seeing myself contributing to ISKCON in the future keeps me aligned 
              with a spiritual identity. </p>
            <p>At this point, as I approach Krsna consciousness, I feel like a 
              new <i>bhakta </i>in the sense that I am approaching it in a completely 
              different frame of mind than I did when I was younger. I understand 
              that I have a long way to go spiritually and have many things to 
              learn about the science of Krsna consciousness, but I feel fortunate 
              that at least I do not need to struggle for what many people in 
              the world are struggling for: namely, finding a spiritual path that 
              fills them with deep satisfaction. </p>
            <p>Someone recently asked me whether I felt my past experience in 
              ISKCON was positive or negative. I had to think for a while. I answered 
              that I feel that if I had not been able to go out and take the time 
              to make up for the things that my Hare Krsna upbringing denied me, 
              then I would view it today as a negative experience. But now, because 
              I feel that I have gotten the chance to compensate for the limitations 
              in my early life, I have a more balanced perspective of reality 
              and can accept Krsna consciousness in my life. I don't feel threatened 
              in designating myself as a devotee because I have enough power and 
              independence to go out and make up for the things that ISKCON cannot 
              give me. Because of this broader definition of what it means to 
              be a devotee, identifying as a devotee does not make me feel deprived 
              in any way; in fact, Krsna consciousness brings many positive experiences 
              in my life today. </p>
            <p>One devotee who has made a big difference in the way I perceive 
              ISKCON is Anuttama Dasa, of ISKCON Communications. He gives me hope 
              that there are open-minded, educated and understanding adults within 
              ISKCON. His personal example shows me the future of ISKCON, a future 
              in which leaders will have changed their whole paradigm of the concept 
              of preaching: from a society of cliché-spouting 'preachers', who 
              try to force their own interpretation of scripture down other people's 
              throats, to a society of spiritual individu-als who lead others 
              through the process of empathic listening and through their own 
              personal example of principle-centred Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p>I look forward to being in that ISKCON. </p>
