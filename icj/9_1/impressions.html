            <p class="maintext"><i>The Family and Youth Conference covered twenty 
              hours of presentations and discussions covering a range of subjects. 
              At the end of the conference, several participants were asked to 
              speak informally about the impressions they had gathered and any 
              lessons that had been learned. </i></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Yudhisthira Dasa<br>
              The healing power of the conference </p>
            <p>For me, the most constructive part of the conference was the discussion 
              about bridging the gap between the generations. As a second-generation 
              devotee, it was very fulfilling that people were interested in my 
              opinion and were appreciative. Even though it has been very easy 
              to stereotype ISKCON - and I personally have at times been very 
              resentful towards ISKCON - it's nice to realise that it is a community 
              of devotees; and as much as I blame ISKCON for sometimes being very 
              impersonal, I understand that I've also been impersonal in my thinking 
              about ISKCON. That has been a first step in bridging that gap. </p>
            <p>Even when I've been resentful towards ISKCON, I've always had some 
              respect for the philosophy. I've always respected my parents for 
              keeping discussions on Prabhupada's books in perspective. I remember 
              my mother being very upset when I first left <i>gurukula </i>and 
              I was using the word '<i>karmi</i>' all the time. She would say: 
              'No, that's the wrong way, this is Mr. Zigger the farmer, this is 
              so and so'. So, throughout my life, through my parents, there's 
              been a kind of liberal understanding of the philosophy. This conference 
              has reminded me that they are not the only ones that think that 
              way about Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p>A very practical thing that I play with, use, and understand is 
              misuse of language. This came out very well in the discussions about 
              how the language of Prabhupada's books, and for some <i>gurukulis 
              </i>even <i>japa</i>, can trigger things. Part of bridging the gap 
              is to understand the role that language and symbols play. I am wearing 
              this orange five-dollar shirt from GAP; I looked at it in my bag 
              today, and I realised that there are connotations for me wearing 
              saffron (the colour worn by <i>brahmacaris </i>and other renunciates). 
              Something as simple as a colour can make a difference in how you 
              are perceived, in how you are accepted, and how you relate. This 
              was a very valuable part of the conference. </p>
            <p>Some commonalities were also revealed during the conference. This 
              conference was originally envisioned as a youth conference to deal 
              with some of the tensions between the first generation and the second 
              generation. Then it very quickly encompassed family life and parenting 
              and other related issues. We know that the youth suffered in many 
              ways because of things that happened in ISKCON, but it has also 
              become very obvious that women also suffered, and so have whole 
              families and married couples. It's larger than just a youth issue. 
              There is a commonality; we weren't the only people that got the 
              rough end of the stick. </p>
            <p>Then there is whole 'third culture' idea presented by Norma McCaig, 
              who showed the commonality between Vaisnava youth and people who 
              have converted to Vaisnavism. Of course, there is a large difference 
              between growing up as a 'third-culture kid' and being someone who 
              has developed some sense of identity before travelling between cultures. 
              Still, I think every person in that presentation found something 
              that they could relate to. </p>
            <p>When I was fifteen, coming out of <i>gurukula</i>, I don't remember 
              seeing many <i>gurukulis </i>being really serious about being a 
              devotee. It has become obvious that more than half of the children 
              who grew up as devotees after my time are very proud to be devotees. 
              Instead of having an inferiority complex about it, the way we did, 
              they have some sort of superiority complex, and I think that's very 
              healthy. That has also been very heartening. I am very grateful 
              for the opportunity to have participated. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Visakha Devi Dasi<br>
              Integrity and marriage </p>
            <p>I've noted three basic themes during this conference. The first 
              is integrity. </p>
            <p>Integrity has been very much overlooked in our society and in our 
              individual relationships, and we've suffered immensely from that. 
              We often lacked integrity in our dealings with the children, being 
              unable to perceive their suffering. My husband and I were in Dallas 
              in 1974 filming when Srila Prabhupada was there, and I would watch 
              these young children offering their prostrated obeisances to Srila 
              Prabhupada. I was totally oblivious to what was going on in that 
              school at that time. When I look back on how oblivious I was, I 
              feel awful. We are now reaping the results of our failure in this 
              field of integrity. Rukmini Devi Dasi eloquently expressed that 
              as representatives of Srila Prabhupada and Krsna we should display 
              the highest integrity, and that if we continue to fail in this, 
              then Prabhupada's movement will be on very rocky terrain. </p>
            <p>Another aspect of this issue of integrity came up in Burke Rochford's 
              paper. He noted that the focus of ISKCON is shifting from the temples 
              to the family, and that the family unit is less likely than a temple 
              community have a leader impose himself upon it. Instead, individual 
              family members can be inspired by devotees with integrity and Krsna 
              consciousness, and with qualities that they want to emulate and 
              imbibe in their own lives. This is a fundamental and important shift. 
            </p>
            <p>The second basic theme of this conference has been Krsna conscious 
              marriage. This is another important field that has often been overlooked. 
              What are the problems? How do we solve these problems in a Krsna 
              conscious way? Who do we look to for answers? Can we go to nondevotee 
              counsellors? There are many major questions we have to face. </p>
            <p>The third theme is awareness, which can be integrated with integrity. 
              The whole idea of the 'third-culture kids' that Norma spoke of raised 
              awareness of the issues our children faced. Again, we were oblivious. 
              My daughter was saying that we moved every two years for fifteen 
              years. When she was ten she had been going to school for five years, 
              and she had been to five different schools. I wasn't aware of how 
              that would affect her. Now I'm more aware, and now we're trying 
              to have a more stable situation for our second daughter. </p>
            <p>This conference has been an opportunity for devotees to share their 
              perspectives. I hope there are many more such conferences. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Nataka Chandrika Devi Dasi<br>
              The importance of the family </p>
            <p>As I began listening to and assimilating the presentations at this 
              conference, the same theme kept surfacing in my mind: the role of 
              family. The importance of a loving, solid, Krsna conscious family 
              cannot be overestimated. If our <i>grhasthas </i>had been given 
              more guidance, training, and counselling in what it means to be 
              good parents, many of the problems that we have today would not 
              exist. In a letter to Hamsaduta in 1967, Srila Prabhupada writes: 
              'A child is a rare gift given by Krsna, but at the same time, a 
              great responsibility. Every parent has the respon-sibility to see 
              that his child grows up in Krsna consciousness. I know that you 
              understand this, and will always make Krsna the centre of your home'. 
              In <i>Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead</i>, Prabhupada 
              writes: 'An affectionate mother takes great care of her child and 
              is always anxious to see that the child is not disturbed even for 
              a moment. Mother Yasoda set the example for all affectionate mothers'. 
            </p>
            <p>We as parents have a great responsibility to create loving, stable 
              homes with Krsna in the centre. It is not an easy task, but I have 
              hope that we have learned from our past experi-ences, and can move 
              forward. I strongly advocate premarital counselling, and would suggest 
              that <i>grhasthas </i>who have been married for a long time share 
              their wisdom with new couples. Workshops should be offered covering 
              all aspects from childbirth to graduation. It is our duty to help 
              future generations establish and maintain loving Krsna conscious 
              families. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Manu Dasa<br>
              Vaisnava youth </p>
            <p>Before this conference my first reaction was, 'oh no, not another 
              one'. I've been involved with these conferences since 1989 and have 
              become a little jaded. It seems that after we have all these wonderful 
              discussions, everybody goes home and nothing happens. But this conference 
              was special. I was impressed by how much depth of realisation and 
              maturity some of the young people have developed, particularly Prajyumna 
              and Yudhisthira. Sometimes in my service I feel I'm the only one 
              who cares about our youth, but then I see Prajyumna's and Yudhisthira's 
              presentations and I feel a lot of hope for the future of our movement 
              because their vision and their maturity and their way of looking 
              at things is very refreshing. </p>
            <p>I was also interested in Dhira Govinda Dasa's view of the outside 
              world as a place for preaching. For my generation, when we go into 
              the outside world, we don't typically view it as a preaching opportunity. 
              Generally the last thing we want to tell anybody is that we are 
              Hare Krsnas. And why is that? I've been trying to examine this phenomenon, 
              and I'm still struggling with it. Why am I embarrassed, sometimes 
              even ashamed to be seen as a devotee? Sometimes the more I work 
              with the youth, and the more I work with the child protection office, 
              the more I become ashamed to tell people that I'm a Hare Krsna. 
              Why? </p>
            <p>The recurring answer, to me, has to do with respect and honesty. 
              It would help if we could just be decent human beings and be perceived 
              in public as such, rather than being perceived as people who harass 
              you and who you want to run away from. It would also help if we 
              would respect every human being and not look down on them; if we 
              could dispense with the attitude, 'you're just a <i>karmi</i>, therefore 
              I can do all kinds of activities and justify them'. If we can develop 
              these attitudes, we can help to change the public's perception, 
              and we can create a movement, an ISKCON, that our children can be 
              proud of. When they go to public school, they can be proud to say 
              they are Hare Krsnas, rather than feel they have to hide the fact. 
            </p>
            <p>I never told anyone at school that I was a Hare Krsna. I never 
              told anyone at my job that I was a Hare Krsna. I was afraid I would 
              be judged according to the common percep-tions of what it means 
              to be a devotee. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Citralekha Devi Dasi<br>
              Summary </p>
            <p>I wasn't sure what to expect from the Family and Youth Conference. 
              I had been working on coordinating it for months but was unsure 
              of how it would turn out. What I found was an incredible coming 
              together of knowledge, experience, and insights from a variety of 
              speakers, ranging from second-generation youth to ISKCON well-wishers. 
            </p>
            <p>The first day was very powerful, starting off with Burke Rochford's 
              scholarly presentation (read by Anuttama Dasa) about ISKCON's transitional 
              years, which held everyone in rapt attention. Also, Arcana Siddhi's 
              Devi Dasi's skit and workshop on relationships gave much-needed 
              skills for devotees to work through solving difficult, real life 
              marital and relationship problems. </p>
            <p>The evening youth session stands out most in my mind as the door 
              leading from the past to the future. When Prajyumna and Yudhisthira 
              read their papers about their lives growing up within the confines 
              of ISKCON I was struck with grief, and simultaneously was in awe 
              at how intelligently they used those experiences to provide an inner 
              strength. The youth in the audience resonated strongly with Yudhisthira's 
              and Prajyumna's views, which then led to a discussion between the 
              generations in an attempt to understand each other's sensitivities 
              to actions and words that might trigger negative emotions. </p>
            <p>By the second day, the momentum for open-minded reception reached 
              new heights as Norma McCaig spoke on the topic of 'third-culture 
              Krsna kids', a new concept to most in ISKCON. The response was very 
              positive as parents, teachers, and youth sought to apply what they 
              heard to relationships, life strategies, and school curriculum. 
            </p>
            <p>On the final day of the conference, the professional and business 
              expertise of Dhira Govinda Dasa, Rukmini Devi Dasi, Haridasa Dasa, 
              and Radha Devi Dasi, offered a progres-sive perspective on how to 
              maintain a devotional identity while working in the world; a frequent 
              challenge in our present ISKCON society. It is not always easy to 
              keep a devotional focus while pursuing a career path so all aspects 
              of the discussion were seriously considered as invaluable information. 
            </p>
            <p>As the conference was wrapping up, people-watching became my barometer 
              to evaluate the overall attendee experience. Small groups gathered 
              to exchange thoughts and ideas while others offered their congratulations 
              and asked when the next conference will take place. My impression? 
              The conference was a great success. </p>
