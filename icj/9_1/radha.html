            <p align="left"><i>A practical question: How does a Vaisnava behave 
              in modern society? Radha Devi Dasi compares and contrasts the role 
              of the devotee as a bearer of compassion and humble servant of all 
              with the practice of using 'transcendence' as a cover for condescension 
              and dishonesty. </i></p>
            <p>In the wake of the disastrous events of 11 September 2001, when 
              thousands of people died in infernos created by hijacked airplanes 
              in New York City and Washington, DC, I was asked to write an article 
              on Vaisnava ethics. As I struggled to articulate standards of Vaisnava 
              behaviour that I find difficult to apply in my own life, I listened 
              to other devotees wrestle with their attempts to understand and 
              respond to evil actions taken in the name of religion. I heard some 
              in my community dismiss the events of September 11 as the karma 
              of those who died, meriting little sympathy, merely natural reactions 
              of a hellish material world. I saw the tears and heard the pain 
              in the voices of other friends who were heartbroken at the suffering 
              that was taking place, the inevitable suffering that would result 
              from America's reaction to the attack, and what they perceived to 
              be callousness in the hearts of others. </p>
            <p>The Vaisnava Family and Youth Conference at the New Raman Reti 
              community in Alachua, Florida, provided a forum where devotees could 
              discuss the Vaisnava perspective on world disasters and possible 
              courses of action that concerned Vaisnavas could take. The unifying 
              theme of all discussions was the duty of the Vaisnava to respond 
              to the needs of other living entities with compassion. This theme 
              of care and concern, while expressed in different ways by different 
              people, convinced me that Vaisnava ethics is ultimately the application 
              of the love for each other that springs from recognition of our 
              common Father, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His merciful 
              love for us. We cannot be indifferent to the suf-fering of others, 
              because Krsna is never indifferent toward us. </p>
            <p>Ethics addresses the question of how we behave and how we ought 
              to behave. Behaviour springs from belief. Our metaphysical view 
              of the universe and its constituent parts gives us the framework 
              for ordering our daily life choices. In his essay 'Our Ecological 
              Crisis', Tamal Krsna Goswami (1998) treats ethics as a moral theology 
              which seeks to apply religious doctrine to practical life. How does 
              a Vaisnava live in the world? </p>
            <p>For Vaisnavas, examination of ethical behaviour may, but need not 
              always, deal with the actions expected of a pure devotee. Such souls, 
              serving Krsna's will in all situations, have no need of instruction 
              in proper behaviour. </p>
            <p>Of more benefit to the rest of us is an articulation of the principles 
              by which the unperfected may regulate behaviour. Lacking pure Krsna 
              consciousness, we may be misguided as to what constitutes proper 
              behaviour. Ethical principles, like a roadmap, offer direction to 
              those who have not travelled this way before. </p>
            <p>Our understanding of how to relate to others springs from our understanding 
              of our own nature and of our relationship with our creator. Almost 
              without exception, people in general gain their sense of how they 
              ought to act in the world, of what is right and what is wrong, from 
              their religious world view (Carmody, p. 6). </p>
            <p>For the Vaisnava, identity is clear. We are spirit souls, parts 
              of our Supreme Lord Krsna, and we are His eternal servants. Such 
              an identity has immediate implications for our relationship to other 
              living entities. If, as we are taught, all living entities are spirit 
              souls, then we are all interconnected by virtue of our relationship 
              to Krsna. We are, as Kipling puts it, 'sisters under the skin'. 
              Moreover, there is an inherent equality of all living entities because 
              we all share the same spiritual essence. Thus, our relations with 
              others must be guided by principles of egalitarianism and concern 
              for others. </p>
            <p>Indeed, our Vaisnava tradition articulates specific injunctions 
              for behaviour, the foremost of which is compassion. The incantation 
              we recite daily, offering our obeisances to other Vaisnavas, explicitly 
              states that such persons are 'full of compassion' for the living 
              entities. Indeed, it is the duty of the Vaisnava to become the humble 
              servant of other living entities. </p>
            <p>This duty of service to others, while not the main tenet of <i>bhakti-yoga</i>, 
              follows logically from our objective of serving the Supreme Lord. 
              The Lord describes Himself, in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, as '<i>suhrdam 
              sarva-bhutanam</i>', or the well-wishing friend of every living 
              entity. If we desire to please the Lord, then we must accept as 
              our mission the roles of friend and helpers of others in their various 
              material manifestations. </p>
            <p>Our Vaisnava <i>acaryas </i>have clearly modelled the role of compassionate 
              servant for our benefit. Haridasa Thakura, associate of Sri Caitanya 
              Mahaprabhu and the <i>acarya </i>of the holy name, embodied concern 
              for others in his response to the soldiers who were ordered to execute 
              him. Because of his great spiritual potency, their severe beatings 
              did not have the expected effect of ending his life. However, when 
              they informed him that failure to carry out their instructions and 
              execute him would cause them suffering, Haridasa Thakura arranged 
              his apparent death to protect these soldiers from punishment. </p>
            <p>This history is significant in that Haridasa Thakura's concern 
              extended to the material well-being of the soldiers and was not 
              conditioned upon their acceptance of any religious practice or philosophical 
              perspective. Haridasa did not dismiss the potential suffering of 
              his tormentors as material illusion, nor did he dismiss the potential 
              consequences to the soldiers as their karmic reaction for the harm 
              they had inflicted on him. His concern for his persecutors transcended 
              considerations of his own well being. </p>
            <p>Haridasa Thakura's example of extreme tolerance and compassion 
              perfectly embodies the instructions of his spiritual master, Sri 
              Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In the <i>Sri Siksastaka, </i>Lord Caitanya 
              instructed His followers on the behaviour required to reach transcendence. 
              One must think himself lower than the grass. One must be more tolerant 
              than a tree and always prepared to give respect to others. </p>
            <p>This injunction of tolerance requires compassion toward other living 
              entities. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura wrote in his <i>Sri Sanmodana 
              Bhasyam </i>that the servant of Lord Krsna is kinder than the tree 
              which gives shade to everyone. The Vaisnava is 'compassionate to 
              every living entity, whether friend or foe, desiring only their 
              highest welfare ... He understands that all living entities are 
              eternal servants of Lord Krsna, so he is never envious of anyone'. 
              (Sarvabhavana Dasa, pp. 35-6) </p>
            <p>Another way to understand the Vaisnava's duty toward others is 
              to examine the meaning of leadership and mastery within the Vaisnava 
              tradition. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has enjoined us to 'become spiritual 
              masters'. The materially conditioned response to such an injunction 
              is to seek a way to control other living entities. Mastery, in the 
              material world, has been historically associated with conquest and 
              domination. The Vaisnava understanding of 'master', however, is 
              that of servant leader, of one who empowers others to find their 
              full potential. The Vaisnava encourages others to take up the practice 
              of <i>bhakti-yoga</i>. He never mistreats anyone or views anyone 
              as his inferior. (Sarvabhavana Dasa, p. 38) </p>
            <p>Lord Caitanya used humility to conquer the false ego of the <i>mayavadi 
              sannyasis </i>in Nadia. Rather than defeat them in a philosophical 
              debate, demanding the respect that was surely His due, He humbly 
              seated Himself in an unclean place and listened respectfully to 
              their words, even though He fully intended to persuade them of their 
              error. Thus, to perfectly follow this instruction of Lord Caitanya's, 
              to become spiritual masters to the whole world, Vaisnavas must humbly 
              approach others. We must kindly listen to their concerns and beliefs. 
              We must lovingly persuade, not condescendingly debate. </p>
            <p>Two particular areas of behaviour have proved dangerous to Vaisnavas 
              attempting to practice Krsna consciousness in society at large. 
              First, the false ego is a very real barrier to spreading the practice 
              of <i>bhakti-yoga</i>. Condescension is an obvious and extremely 
              distasteful attitude which can be more of a barrier to Krsna than 
              locking the temple room doors. Our false ego may be stimulated by 
              the assumption that, because we have been extended the mercy of 
              access to a spiritually advanced philosophy, we are superior to 
              other living entities and may exploit them. </p>
            <p>Aspiring Vaisnavas are unlikely to articulate the foregoing mentality 
              overtly. However, the mindset of superiority and exploitation may 
              be reflected in language which dismisses our non-Vaisnava neighbours 
              as '<i>karmis</i>' or 'meateaters', intimating a very real and substantial 
              basis for condemnation. In the past, ISKCON's unfortunate practice 
              of 'transcendental trickery' provided a rationale for everything 
              from raiding our neighbours' gardens for flowers to misrepresenting 
              our identity on <i>sankirtana</i>; these practices rested firmly 
              on the notion that Vaisnavas are ethically superior. Our superiority 
              became a philosophical basis for lying, stealing, and other unsavoury 
              practices. </p>
            <p>Only a little maturity is needed to see the counterproductivity 
              of such actions. If our duty is, as we are instructed, to engage 
              other living entities in Krsna's service, we should avoid wrongdoing. 
              The neighbour whose rose bush is stripped before each festival is 
              more likely to resent Krsna than to worship Him. To say that the 
              unwilling service of providing flowers is better than no service 
              at all is to assume that Vaisnavas could not attract such persons 
              to the worship of the Lord over time. Surely a willing and committed 
              servant is preferable to one who serves only by being robbed. </p>
            <p>Moreover, our philosophy makes clear that we who practice <i>bhakti-yoga 
              </i>are not superior to other living entities. In reality, all spirit 
              souls are minute parts of the Supreme Lord. Devotional service is 
              the eternal duty, or <i>sanatana-dharma</i>, of every living entity. 
              Some souls are more entangled in material illusion than others. 
              However, our true identities are similar and equal. How can we be 
              superior to others on the basis of an illusion? </p>
            <p>Indeed, the <i>less </i>covered we are by material energy, the 
              <i>more </i>we should fulfill our duty of serving other living entities. 
              We are enjoined to work for the highest welfare of others. To bring 
              others to Krsna's service, we must first attract them to hear our 
              words and consider our example. Thus, we must be involved and caring 
              members of society. Otherwise, we remain on the fringes of society, 
              without the influence that will permit the Vaisnava message to be 
              heard. </p>
            <p>A second pitfall for the Vaisnava in dealing with the larger society 
              arises in the area of social disobedience. Many major religious 
              traditions have articulated theories which justify ignoring social 
              law and convention. Indeed, the recognition of a Supreme Being implies 
              the possibility of His will being contrary to the laws or conventions 
              of mankind. </p>
            <p>ISKCON has in the past taken social disobedience to unreasonable 
              lengths. Some of our members have articulated a belief that following 
              local laws and customs is unnecessary for anyone practicing <i>bhakti-yoga</i>. 
              Such an attitude is at best duplicitous and at worst exploitative. 
            </p>
            <p>One who truly renounces society may also renounce its rules and 
              regulations. However, this article concerns itself with the behavioural 
              practices of Vaisnavas living in 'the world', society at large. 
              We accept the benefits society provides. For example, I drive on 
              roads maintained by government agencies. When at work, my right 
              to wages is protected and enforced by law. Policemen, firefighters, 
              emergency medical personnel will come to my aid if I need them. 
              If I become impoverished, the government and private religious and 
              charitable agen-cies will help me and my family obtain food, shelter, 
              and medical care. </p>
            <p>When in need, I can avail myself of these services. I benefit from 
              the way my society is organised and from the rules which enforce 
              proper behaviour. Thus, I am a liar and a cheater if I unilaterally 
              and covertly decide that I need not respect the social and legal 
              structures which work to my benefit. </p>
            <p>ISKCON temples and members around the world are generally protected 
              by the governments and societies in which we live. We have a duty 
              of reciprocation for the benefits and services we receive. Certainly, 
              those living in countries where the practice of Krsna consciousness 
              is forbidden will be forced to hide their behaviour and secretly 
              break the law. But civil disobedience, where necessary, must be 
              limited in scope and practiced only in extreme circumstances. </p>
            <p>Vaisnava ethics do not differ greatly from the ethics of other 
              major religions. Moreover, they are easily discernible by the exercise 
              of basic common sense. When in doubt, we can always refer to the 
              four moral precepts which uphold our regulative principles. Truthfulness 
              is preferable to dishonesty. Kindness and compassion are preferable 
              to cruelty. Generosity and renunciation are preferable to greediness. 
              Order and cleanliness are preferable to the shabbiness and littering 
              which sometimes result from our failure to maintain the facilities 
              we have been given. </p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada wanted his followers to be recognisable as perfect 
              gentlemen. As we make our way in the larger human family, we should 
              be welcomed on the basis of our kindness and consideration for those 
              around us. If we remember to treat others with the kindness we have 
              received from the devotees who inspire us, our temples will not 
              be large enough to hold all those who wish to enter. </p>
