            <p class="maintextsubhead">Translated by Gopiparanadhana Dasa <br>
              Publisher: Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Grödinge, Sweden, 2002 <br>
              ISBN: 91-7149-439-1 </p>
            <p>The <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta</i>, by Sanatana Gosvami, (1486-1533) 
              is a consummate rendering in Sanskrit verse of Vaisnava devotional 
              spirituality as inspired by Krsna-Caitanya, or simply Caitanya. 
              Analogous in some respects to Dante's <i>Paradiso </i>and more closely 
              akin to John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress, </i>it depicts two 
              parallel spiritual odysseys. The first is of Narada, the paradigm 
              of the devout Vaisnava saint/sage; the other is of Gopa-kumara, 
              a simple lad in search of God. The former travels across India and 
              into heavenly realms in search of those devotees, human or divine, 
              to whom God, Krsna, has been most merciful. In the course of his 
              quest, Narada encounters ever more profound and dedicated embodiments 
              of devotion (<i>bhakti</i>) to Krsna. Each of these personalities 
              deferentially redirects him to others yet more devout - and yet 
              more favoured by Krsna - than themselves. The dialogues en route 
              - subtly interpreted in an extensive auto-commentary - are so designed 
              as to instruct, edify, and inspire devout readers or listeners. 
              The lad, Gopa-kumara, likewise provides the occasion for progressive 
              spiritual discovery as one follows his pilgrimage from one realm 
              to another in search of ever more sublime and quintessential manifestations 
              of the divine. </p>
            <p>Narada's search culminates in the paradoxical revelation that the 
              devotees most favoured by Krsna - those whose devotion to Him is 
              most perfect and intense - are <i>gopis, </i>simple (though divine) 
              cowherd girls who are in torment when their beloved Krsna is absent 
              from them. Gopa-kumara's quest leads to the discovery that Krsna 
              reveals Himself most perfectly in the idyllic heavenly realm of 
              Goloka (and in the terrestrial Vrndavana), where He sports eternally 
              as youthful lover of the <i>gopis </i>and playmate of the cowherd 
              boys. </p>
            <p>Within the framework of this dual spiritual odyssey presented together 
              with an extensive commentary - the <i>Dig-darsini </i>- the sixteenth-century 
              author, Sanatana Gosvami, analyses with delicate nuances and orchestrates 
              in masterly fashion the theology-cum-psychology of loving devotion 
              (<i>prema-bhakti</i>) to Krsna as epitomised by Caitanya. To read-ers 
              already familiar with the Puranic Hindu pantheon and imagery and 
              appreciative of the Vaisnava commitment to <i>prema-bhakti </i>to 
              Krsna, the luxuriant transcendental scenes and unrestrained displays 
              of ecstatic devotion need not seem exotic. But the vividness and 
              novelty of many vignettes and the poignant emotional vulnerability 
              of Krsna may evoke surprise and wonder even among seasoned Vaisnava 
              devotees. Even the reader new to the cosmology, mythology, and theology 
              of Vaisnava devotion, if reasonably patient and attentive, may find 
              in the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>and <i>Dig-darsini </i>a remarkably 
              incisive, consistent, and revealing exploration of human spirituality 
              and religious psychology. </p>
            <p>For Vaisnava devotees in the tradition of Caitanya, the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta 
              </i>and its commentary are foundational texts of great value. Sanatana 
              Gosvami was the most senior of the authoritative scholar-devotees 
              deputed by Caitanya to formulate the appropriate theology of <i>prema-bhakti 
              </i>to Krsna. Sanatana's poetic narrative, supplemented by its commentary, 
              is the most thorough and penetrating statement of his theological 
              ideas and spiritual sensibilities. Significantly, I think, this, 
              his most ambitious work, takes the form of narrative and dialogue. 
              The <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>is carefully organised, and it is 
              dramatic and imaginative in form. Though based on the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              - </i>the essence, or nectar <i>(amrta), </i>of which it aspires 
              to express - the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>is not in the form of 
              a commentary as such. It is itself a <i>Purana</i>-like tale which, 
              though composed by Sanatana, is told as an ancient discourse by 
              King Pariksit to his mother, Uttara. Like a <i>Purana, </i>it presents 
              exemplary personages, memorable incidents, and striking imagery. 
              All of this serves to nourish the reflection and meditation, i.e., 
              the <i>smarana </i>(lit. remembering), of devout readers or hearers. 
              The content of the text is words, but these are picture words rather 
              than book words. They evoke the experiential basis upon which secondary 
              theoretical and practical elaboration may be built. By expressing 
              his own conception of loving devotion to God in the form of the 
              dual odysseys of Narada and Gopa-kumara, Sanatana was in effect 
              endorsing literary narrative of a poetic and dramatic sort as a 
              preferred means for passing on to subsequent generations the crucial 
              experience (<i>anubhuti</i>) of loving devotion. </p>
            <p>For devotees of Krsna in the modern world who are not fluent in 
              Sanskrit, access to Sanatana's foundational poem must be by translations 
              or paraphrase. There are several versions in Bengali and Hindi, 
              and perhaps in some other Indian languages. There is an English 
              translation of the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>by Sriman Bhakti Prajnan 
              Yati Maharaja from the Sri Gaudiya Math (Madras), but none, so far 
              as I know, of the <i>Dig-darsini. </i>The present edition includes 
              translations by Gopiparanadhana Dasa of both the basic poem and 
              its commentary (plus appendices, glossary, etc.). This is an extraordinary 
              labour of love! The <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>alone contains some 
              2,500 Sanskrit verses, each requiring painstaking care even when 
              being rendered into idiomatic English prose rather than metrical 
              verse (a wise course to follow). The commentary is considerably 
              longer and, although in Sanskrit prose, is far from easy to convey 
              in readable, accurate English. Yet the task has been done and done 
              well; an impressive achievement indeed. </p>
            <p>When I first began to examine the proofs for this book, I was pleased 
              to find that Gopiparanadhana Dasa's English prose version reads 
              clearly and crisply. Moreover, it conveys the excitement, wonder, 
              and devotion of spiritual discovery that animates Sanatana's own 
              composition. The more I read, the more fascinated I became with 
              Sanatana's novel and bril-liant retelling of themes emanating from 
              the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam </i>(but developed into much that is not 
              found explicitly in that revered text). Depictions of progressively 
              more intense and intimate modes of loving devotion build to a climax 
              in the remarkable portrayal of Krsna at Dvaraka, where He was at 
              one time depressed and feeling anguish in the absence of Radha and 
              the <i>gopis </i>but was then restored to 'normal' consciousness 
              by an artful ruse. </p>
            <p>The further I read, the less was I conscious that I was reading 
              a translation, so naturally does one unit of the narrative flow 
              into the next. When I did shift to the task of compar-ing portions 
              of the translation with the Sanskrit, I was pleased to discover 
              that the English prose is indeed very faithful to the Sanskrit original. 
              One might quibble over the choice of certain idiomatic English phrases, 
              but even these convey the basic sense. From the literal meaning 
              of the original, little is left out, and very little is added in 
              the passage from Sanskrit to English. Inevitably, of course, some 
              resonance is lost in any transition from poetic verse to prose translation. 
              But, fortunately, because the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>is mostly 
              narrative and dialogue, it lends itself more readily to a prose 
              rendering than would other types of poetic verse. I would like to 
              think that Sanatana Gosvami would welcome his modern prose translator 
              as a kindred spirit and an able expositor of his work. </p>
            <p>The <i>Dig-darsini, </i>being prose, but prose in the peculiar 
              form of Sanskrit textual commentary, presents the translator with 
              a different set of challenges. It is twice the length of the document 
              that it interprets. In form and function, it resembles the complex 
              footnotes of modern scholarship. In orientation, it assumes broadly 
              ranging acquaintance with traditional Vaisnava themes, Sanskrit 
              religious literature, and technical points of devotional aesthetics, 
              theology, and philosophy. Faced with such challenges, many a translator 
              - and, if not he or she, then the publisher - would resort to a 
              paraphrase that drastically cuts down the size and simplifies the 
              scholarship of the commentary, and perhaps introduces an ersatz 
              ideo-logical or rhetorical interpretation in place of the more demanding 
              and sophisticated orientation of the author. </p>
            <p>Not so the present translator and publisher. Both Gopiparanadhana 
              Dasa and the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust are to be commended for respecting 
              Sanatana's auto-commentary as it is, in all its bulk and sophistication. 
              The <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta </i>and <i>Dig-darsini </i>together comprise 
              a classic of religious literature whose integrity ought not be compromised. 
              On a narrow scale, these two works are classic in that they are 
              the template for the theology and spiritual psychology that have 
              remained authoritative for the Caitanya Vaisnava tradition. And 
              though till now scarcely known beyond that tradition and those who 
              study it, they are - or merit being so recognised as - classics 
              on a global scale as well. Sanatana Gosvami's <i>chef d'oeuvre </i>is 
              a masterful exploration, grounded in Vaisnava devotional faith, 
              of human spirituality and religious psychology, here for the first 
              time made accessible in its entirety to the English-reading world. 
            </p>
            <p>As the translator acknowledges, the English version of the <i>Dig-darsini 
              </i>is a paraphrase, not a line-by-line translation. As such, it 
              does not replace a close reading of the original for scholars capable 
              of reading Sanskrit. But, as the translator points out (and illustrates 
              in the appendices), the paraphrasing is largely a matter of arrangement, 
              not of selective excision or augmentation. From the portions of 
              Volume One that I have compared closely, it is evident that Gopiparanadhana 
              Dasa has managed to retain virtually all of the content of the original 
              commentary, though with considerable rearrangement to facilitate 
              reading. Were his aim to produce a rigorously literal English rendering, 
              some of his paraphrasing of Sanatana's formulations might well have 
              to be revisited. But, all things considered, Gopiparanadhana Dasa 
              has done an admirable job of conveying the informational content 
              and spiritual verve of the author - without bowdlerising or truncating 
              - in an idiom understandable to patient and attentive (though not 
              necessarily expert) readers. I presume that the quality achieved 
              in Volume One has been maintained through Volumes Two and Three. 
            </p>
            <p>There is a special significance to this publication over and above 
              its making accessible to readers of English two classic Sanskrit 
              spiritual literatures. This is the first publication by the Bhaktivedanta 
              Book Trust of such major Vaisnava theological texts that disciples 
              of the late A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada have accomplished 
              without his immediate pres- </p>
            <p>ence. It follows the widely disseminated versions of the <i>Bhagavad-gita 
              </i>in many languages and multi-volume translations of the <i>Srimad 
              Bhagavatam </i>and the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta, </i>each of which 
              is accompanied by an elaborate commentary. These prior publications 
              were substantially the work of Prabhupada himself, with certain 
              of his Sanskrit-trained devotees, including Gopiparanadhana Dasa, 
              serving as apprentices. The appearance of the <i>Brhad-bhagavatamrta 
              </i>thus marks a new phase of textual theological scholarship by 
              members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. 
              They have, as it were, come into their maturity and can carry the 
              responsibility of faithfully transmitting the Caitanya Vaisnava 
              tradition of <i>prema-bhakti, </i>loving devotion to Krsna. What 
              better way to ensure fidelity to the words and spirit of Caitanya 
              Mahaprabhu and His circle of immediate disciples than to enable 
              devotees and attentive seekers to read, hear, and visualise the 
              foundational texts of those very scholar-devotees who had experienced 
              the charismatic presence of Krsna-Caitanya Himself! </p>
