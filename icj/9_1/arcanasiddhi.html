            <p align="left"><i>In this paper, Arcana Siddhi Devi Dasi draws on 
              her experiences as a counsellor and a mother to propose some guidelines 
              for healthy Vaisnava relationships, particularly in marriage. She 
              challenges us to examine our preconceptions of these relationships 
              and to learn how to practically apply Vaisnava philosophy to this 
              most sensitive aspect of our lives and to the lives of our children. 
              </i></p>
            <p>I joined ISKCON in 1976. At that time I was in graduate school 
              studying to become a psychotherapist. In 1990, I returned to school 
              and finished my masters degree in Clinical Social Work. Since that 
              time I have counselled a number of devotee couples who were struggling 
              to stay in their marriages. Often a couple just needs to learn some 
              basic relationship skills. At other times the couple faces very 
              difficult situations that require them to make adjustments in their 
              Krsna conscious practices or perceptions in order to survive as 
              a couple and to remain in the association of devotees. </p>
            <p>Some years ago a devotee couple left the association of devotees. 
              When I asked them why they had left, they answered that they would 
              rather be good Christians than bad devotees. It wasn't the first 
              time I had heard this logic, and I felt very sad that this couple 
              felt it was all or nothing. While in ISKCON the couple had struggled 
              with abstaining from sexual intimacy, in Christianity they found 
              a religion in which sexual intimacy was allowed. </p>
            <p>I knew another couple that had three children. The husband left 
              his devotee wife because he wasn't ready to completely abstain from 
              sex. His wife, on the other hand, didn't want any more children 
              and refused to consider breaking the regulative principles to satisfy 
              his 'lust'. He ended up having an affair and leaving his wife with 
              their three children and no means of support. She ended up getting 
              a job in a non-vegetarian restaurant to support her children. She 
              had less and less time for <i>sadhana </i>and eventually disappeared 
              from the association of devotees. </p>
            <p>These are tragic scenarios brought about by inflexible, black-and-white 
              thinking. Such thinking affected our whole movement in its early 
              years and perhaps is an unavoidable developmental stage in the growth 
              of a spiritual movement. But Srila Prabhupada was never fanatical. 
              He made practical decisions and adjustments to help transplant Vedic 
              teachings and culture into our Western mindset. Of course, being 
              a self-realised <i>acarya</i>, he had the latitude to make decisions 
              such as reducing the number of rounds of daily <i>japa </i>from 
              64 to 16 and giving brahminical initiation to women. While we have 
              to be careful not to change what Srila Prabhupada gave us, he gave 
              many examples of how practicality in Krsna's service supersedes 
              strict rules and regulations. </p>
            <p>Prabhupada did many things to accommodate our Western mentality, 
              from having Western toilets in his Indian temple projects to allowing 
              men and women to live in temple communities together. He was progressive 
              and innovative in his preaching. He gave permission to his book 
              distributors to wear Western dress and for the men to wear wigs. 
              He always made decisions based on what would benefit the mass of 
              people, even if it didn't conform to Vedic standards. </p>
            <p>In one purport Prabhupada writes: 'To broadcast the cult of Krsna 
              consciousness, one has to learn the possibility of renunciation 
              in terms of country, time and candidate. A candidate for Krsna consciousness 
              in the Western countries should be taught about the renunciation 
              of material existence, but one would teach candidates from a country 
              like India in a different way. The teacher has to consider time, 
              candidate, and country. He must avoid the principle of <i>niyamagraha; 
              </i>that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is 
              possible in one country may not be possible in another. The <i>acarya's 
              </i>duty is accept the essence of devotional service.' (<i>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, 
              </i>Madhya-lila 23.105) </p>
            <p>It is important to see that Prabhupada tried different strategies 
              for spreading Krsna consciousness. If something wasn't working, 
              Prabhupada would be quick to change it. For example, public chanting, 
              <i>harinama</i>, was a successful strategy for spreading Krsna consciousness 
              in the West, but when Prabhupada had his disciples introduce <i>harinama</i>-<i>sankirtana 
              </i>in India, it was not effective - rather, it created a negative 
              impression of our movement, despite the fact that Lord Caitanya 
              had propagated Krsna consciousness throughout India by <i>harinama</i>-<i>sankirtana 
              </i>500 years ago. Prabhupada was able to assess the situation and 
              devise a programme of Life Membership in India which proved to be 
              very successful. </p>
            <p>We, as Prabhupada's disciples, were not so flexible in our thinking 
              and were not able to make adjustments as Prabhupada did. Rigid thinking 
              and hard-line dictums often left devotees in very difficult situations. 
            </p>
            <p>I would like to cite a personal example of how inflexible thinking 
              can create a dilemma for devotees. My temple authority advised me 
              that leaving my fallen husband was acceptable, but that remarriage 
              was not acceptable. I was a young mother with a four-year-old son. 
              The scriptures do say that a woman should not remarry, but they 
              also teach that a woman should always be protected by a husband, 
              father, or grown-up son. Since staying in my marriage was not an 
              option, the only possibility my authority left me with was to remain 
              unmarried and unprotected. Vedic culture was set up to protect women 
              who were not married. Unfortunately, ISKCON had (and still has) 
              a long way to go towards protection of unmarried women. </p>
            <p>I did eventually remarry, and remarriage has become tacitly accepted 
              in ISKCON, owing to the fact that unmarried women are given such 
              limited support and facility. While I don't advocate divorce and 
              remarriage, they became necessary for the survival of ISKCON's first-generation 

              <i>grhastha-asrama</i>. Many marriages were put together with little 
              considera-tion of spiritual and material compatibility. Some devotees 
              never even saw their spouses prior to their marriage ceremonies. 
              In other situations, the moment a man and woman began to associate, 
              the community addressed them as husband and wife. This created a 
              lot of pressure for mismatched couples to tie the knot. Looking 
              back, it is easy to see our attempts as a very poor imitation of 
              Vedic-style arranged marriages - sincere, though misguided. </p>
            <p>Another obstacle that Western devotees face in finding and keeping 
              suitable spouses is our indoctrination into a culture that intensely 
              promotes romantic encounters. Romance and passionate love affairs 
              are the theme of most literature and media presentations. Just doing 
              our daily errands, we are bombarded with images of embracing, kissing 
              couples. </p>
            <p>In <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>(Sixth Canto) there is the story of 
              Ajamila, a pious <i>brahmana </i>who left his saintly wife for a 
              prostitute after witnessing the prostitute passionately embracing 
              her suitor. Ajamila had been trained in religious principles since 
              birth, and he was surrounded by religious persons, yet he still 
              fell down as a result of witnessing a sight that is ubiquitous in 
              our culture. In our neophyte stage of spiritual advancement we are 
              still prey for <i>maya's </i>greatest allurement. </p>
            <p>The institution of marriage is becoming ever weakened in the culture 
              we live in. In <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>it is foretold that in Kali-yuga 
              men and women would unite on the basis of sex attraction only. Consequently, 
              when the sex attraction wanes, which is inevitable, the couple separates. 
            </p>
            <p>The healthy relationship between a man and woman is the building 
              block for a strong <i>grhastha-asrama</i>. And a strong <i>grhastha-asrama 
              </i>is the foundation of a healthy spiritual society. In a <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam 
              </i>purport Srila Prabhupada states: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Affectionate dealings with the husband are very important. It 
                is recommended that a wife be attached and attracted to him. She 
                must treat him with loving intimacy. It is pleasing for the husband 
                to know his wife is devoted to him, willing to please him and 
                fulfil his Krsna conscious ideals. If immediate renunciation is 
                difficult for him, this will enable a man to gradually decrease 
                his material desires. After one has been trained in household 
                life and his lusty desires have decreased, he can move anywhere 
                without danger. (<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>5.1.18) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is critical that we begin preparing our children for living 
              properly in the <i>grhastha-asrama </i>at a very young age. The 
              earlier we introduce life skills that help people have more satisfying 
              relationships, the better. Part of the curriculum for educating 
              children should include relationship skills. These include communication 
              skills, assertiveness skills, and conflict resolution skills. Adolescents 
              need to understand the difference between infatuation and lasting, 
              wholesome attachment. Self-exploration and introspection need to 
              be greatly encouraged to help young people understand their psychological 
              make-up and what kind of person would make a good life partner. 
            </p>
            <p>We can also use astrological charts and psychological personality 
              profiles such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to assist parents 
              and children to understand their natures and to better enable a 
              person to assess compatibility with a potential spouse. </p>
            <p>Another strong recommendation for couples is an extended courtship. 
              The idyllic perspective experienced during a period of infatuation 
              generally lasts between six weeks and six months. During this period, 
              a person is unable to see faults in their beloved. There is the 
              illusion that this person will make one happy eternally, and we 
              feel as if we are floating on a cloud. During this period of euphoria, 
              our best qualities come out. We are more selfless and giving than 
              at any other time. We can have increased energy and can find it 
              difficult to eat or sleep. </p>
            <p>Infatuation is the perverted reflection of unconditional love for 
              Krsna. The difference is that love for Krsna increases eternally 
              and is never-ending, whereas infatuation wanes and the reality of 
              imperfection demystifies the beloved. If the couple has a lot in 
              common, the relationship will continue; if not, it will generally 
              break apart shortly after the infatua-tion ends. It is therefore 
              important that couples not marry or make strong commitments until 
              they have gotten through this period. Of course, this is easier 
              said than done, since often infatuated couples can't be reasoned 
              with. This shows how essential preparation is before attachment 
              sets in. </p>
            <p>Another very helpful tool for couples contemplating marriage is 
              premarital counselling. The couple can explore and share their expectations 
              of marriage. Often people don't even think about what they want 
              or need from a relationship. They somehow expect that these undefined, 
              unspoken needs will magically be met by their spouse. When this 
              doesn't happen, they become disappointed and angry. Often in counselling 
              married couples, these expectations and needs are as much a revelation 
              to the spouse as they are to the person expressing them. Helping 
              couples examine these issues in the beginning sets an accommodating 
              tone and direction for the marriage. It may also help a couple understand 
              that they are less compatible than they thought and allow them to 
              separate before getting married and having children. My experience 
              with devotee children is that they seem much more cautious about 
              entering relationships than their parents, perhaps because they 
              have seen and felt the pain and chaos from the broken relationships 
              of their parents. </p>
            <p>Men's and women's groups have been encouraged in devotee communities 
              as a way to give support and encouragement to one another. It is 
              a fallacy to think that our spouses are capable of meeting all of 
              our relationship needs. Forming intimate relationships with other 
              devotees in this group forum can help support the relationship within 
              marriage and give association to unmarried men and women. We all 
              have a need for society, friendship and love. Failure to find these 
              things in the society of devotees can become a reason for leaving 
              Krsna consciousness. To some extent, these groups can also play 
              the role that the extended family played in Vedic culture. In the 
              early years of ISKCON, <i>grhastha </i>couples often strug-gled 
              with their difficulties in isolation. This had a detrimental effect 
              on both the marital relationship and their Krsna consciousness. 
              Our <i>grhastha-asrama </i>will become much stronger the more we 
              openly discuss our difficulties and counsel each other. </p>
            <p>We are pioneers of this movement, and Prabhupada and Krsna have 
              given us a great responsibility. Before passing away, Prabhupada 
              said that half of his work was done and that he was leaving the 
              remaining half to us. Prabhupada was referring to the establishment 
              of <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>: how to create a society that fulfils 
              peoples' material needs and inclinations while elevating them spiritually. 
              This will require a great amount of maturity, flexibility and creative 
              thinking, as well as strong <i>sadhana. </i></p>
            <p>Strong relationships are a prerequisite to making any project successful. 
              People judge our movement by observing our relationships. So it 
              is in our best interest to become expert at relationship skills. 
              I strongly encourage temple communities to include regular workshops 
              on communication skills, assertiveness skills and conflict resolution. 
            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, there have been many mistakes in the past, and we 
              need to heal from the effects of those mistakes. We also need to 
              learn the lessons from those mistakes and prevent them from happening 
              again. In this way we can go forward with new insights and optimism 
              for the future. </p>
