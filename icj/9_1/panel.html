            <p class="maintext"><i>One of the most valuable opportunities that 
              the Vaisnava Family and Youth Conference gave rise to was open and 
              public dialogue between groups that need to hear from each other. 
              On the final day of the conference there was a panel discussion 
              focusing on an issue with a special relevance to Vaisnava families: 
              What does it mean to be a devotee in a secular world? What are the 
              mistakes of the past and how can we rectify them? </i></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Rukmini Devi Dasi<br>
              Living a transparent life </p>
            <p>Sometimes in the media we hear reformed drug addicts or drug dealers 
              talk about the difficulty they have getting simple, honest jobs 
              after earning fast, easy, illicit money. I think that there's some 
              of that syndrome in our ISKCON. Over the years in ISKCON, people 
              of various abilities and inclinations have been pulled into illicit 
              means of livelihood, such as living off dishonest collections; for 
              them, that fast, easy, illicit money becomes like an addiction. 
              It becomes very difficult to just stop and be humble and accept 
              an honest means of livelihood. </p>
            <p>Consider Srila Prabhupada's living in Ahmedabad as a pharmacist: 
              Could you conceive of Srila Prabhupada watering down one of his 
              pharmaceuticals, or cheating someone on the change they get back 
              after purchasing some medicine? It's inconceivable. Or we can think 
              of one of my personal role models and idols, Kholaveca Sridhara, 
              who was very dear to Lord Caitanya. Kholaveca lived in poverty. 
              He made a meagre living selling banana leaves. From this tiny income, 
              however, he gave half for the worship of the Ganges. Lord Caitanya 
              wouldn't eat unless the food was given to Him on the banana leaves 
              from Kholaveca Sridhara. In fact, the last meal Lord Caitanya took 
              before taking <i>sannyasa </i>was a preparation of <i>kheer </i>made 
              from the flower of a squash plant that Kholaveca Sridhara had grown 
              on his roof. Imagine this type of integrity, then view that against 
              what we often see today in our society. It is very sad and scary. 
            </p>
            <p>It has almost become a cliché that, as his followers, we owe it 
              to Srila Prabhupada to build 'a house in which the whole world can 
              live'. So let's look at that house and its founda-tion. Let's look 
              at the cracks in the foundation and what we have to do build something 
              that will outlast and outlive us. We talk about first generation 
              and second generation, but what about the tenth generation, what 
              about the twentieth generation? </p>
            <p>It is important to lead a transparent life: To have no conflict 
              between the inner and outer life. Then, it would be a pleasant surprise 
              for a business associate to find out you're a Hare Krsna devotee. 
              They would ideally find it beneficial to know someone who has a 
              spiritual practice and is working in the world with integrity. </p>
            <p><i>Spiritual and social ethics </i></p>
            <p>A year or two ago, an article appeared in the <i>Washington Post 
              </i>that spoke about the best work environments: workplaces where 
              people can be happy with a boss that they are peaceful working for. 
              It advised that if we can find a workplace where people have done 
              their spiritual work, then we can have a peaceful working environment. 
            </p>
            <p>It has been pointed out to me that it's easier to do this when 
              you own a business and create your own work ethics. However, there 
              are devotees who have come to a point where they realised that their 
              values were very much in conflict with those of their employees, 
              and they had to take a crucial step: to find work and employment 
              somewhere else, even though the new situation offered less prestige 
              or less money. Sometimes it is a choice between leading a double 
              life or a spiritual life. </p>
            <p>Recently I was interviewed for the business section of <i>USA Today</i>. 
              The reporter, not interested in anything spiritual at all, was writing 
              a story about how the attack on Washington on 11 September 2001, 
              has affected business. A store of ours that is located at the airport 
              is closed, largely due to the attack. The reporter wanted to know 
              what are the patterns, what are the trends, what are we feeling, 
              and how this is hurting us financially. As we talked, I tried to 
              inject some kind of spiritual perspective, which he wasn't picking 
              up on at all. He really just wanted to know how much this is costing 
              us. As he was finishing up his article, he phoned and left a message: 
              'I just want to know, someone like you who has three stores, were 
              you hoping to get rich by this? I don't want to put words in your 
              mouth, but I'm just wondering, what were your intentions?' I phoned 
              him back and said: 'There's a social trend here that you haven't 
              spotted, and if you don't spot it you're making a big mistake'. 
              I told him that I am one of a group of entrepreneurs who is working 
              in the world to create a new social and spiritual ethic in the workplace. 
              I told him if he didn't spot that trend, then he is making a big 
              mistake. I told him I used to live in a spiritual community, and 
              that I opened this business so that I could be more spiritually 
              and socially effective in the world by working in the world. At 
              the end he concluded: 'You know, at a time like this I think we 
              really need something spiritual'. </p>
            <p><i>Building a community within the community </i></p>
            <p>In Washington, the radio traffic reports always identify the traffic 
              as moving either east or west of the Mormon temple, but they don't 
              refer to that building as the Mormon temple, it's just 'The Temple'. 
              When we moved to Washington, my husband would cringe when he heard 
              this. We would be in the car, and he would say, 'I'm so envious. 
              Why can't we build a temple like this? Why don't we have a temple 
              that is a city landmark?' </p>
            <p>In the eight years we've been there we have come to understand 
              that a temple like that comes naturally out of the hearts of people 
              who build community. First of all, we have to build community, and 
              that starts in a microcosmic way. In order to build community, you 
              really have to go back to the individual and how the individual 
              is inspired within his or her heart to act in an exemplary, honest 
              way as a follower of Srila Prabhupada. We have to ask ourselves, 
              'How is Krsna seeing me, how is the world seeing me, how is Prabhupada 
              seeing me?' Christians have a saying: 'With Jesus as my co-pilot'. 
              So we have to think: with Prabhupada as my co-pilot, how am I acting? 
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Radha Devi Da<i>s</i>i<br>
              One foot in each camp </p>
            <p>I think my experience when I first came to the Krsna consciousness 
              movement was somewhat unique at the time, although it is more common 
              now. I was already a mother and a lawyer when I first started going 
              to the temple in San Diego. I have never lived in an <i>asrama, 
              </i>and I didn't go through any training programme, so I'm quite 
              ignorant about some things. At the same time, I've always been 'in 
              the world'; I never really left it. I've always had the experience 
              of trying to balance material life and spiritual life. Part of that 
              is because I never really wanted to be a Hare Krsna. </p>
            <p>I was in law school, and I knew that I needed spiritual guidance. 
              It was very clear that my life was not going to work without a spiritual 
              component. I was going to church and I was praying very sincerely 
              to God, begging Him to show me the way. Someone gave me a copy of 
              Srila Prabhupada's <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</i>; I read the introduction, 
              and it was the answer to my questions. I was not at all happy when 
              I found out it was from the Hare Krsnas. I did not want to become 
              a Hare Krsna. I wasn't going to live the life, it was too weird. 
              I tried to resolve the conflict by becoming a supporter. I had devotees 
              come over to my home, and eventually I got to the point where I 
              realised that I didn't have any other choices. If Krsna had given 
              me any more, I probably wouldn't be here. </p>
            <p><i>Spiritual life is about relationships </i></p>
            <p>Except for two years, I've always worked outside the Hare Krsna 
              movement. It's difficult in some ways, but it's very rewarding in 
              other ways. One interesting observation from this is that we bring 
              the same problems of perception and ego that exist outside our movement 
              into our movement. A big part of my struggle in spiritual life is 
              that I evaluate myself and others. I think they can be counted and 
              measured. If it looks good on my résumé, if it fills my bank account, 
              if somebody will write an article in <i>Back To Godhead </i>magazine 
              about it, then it counts for something. I measure my self-worth 
              by those things. But these aren't the things that really matter. 
              They aren't the things that build our spiritual life. I've seen 
              parallels between behaviours at work and behaviours in my temple 
              community. They're not that different. We like to think that we 
              are very different, but I'm not convinced. </p>
            <p>One of the growing experiences that my husband and I have been 
              going through is learning spirituality on a person-to-person basis, 
              not just counting the value of building temples and doing big projects, 
              essential as these may be. I've come to understand that not everybody 
              can do something big, and not everybody is meant to. That's the 
              message many of us have missed in our spiritual journey. For some 
              time I felt guilty for not doing something big. However, my husband 
              and I found that we're more effective when we deal with people one-on-one, 
              rather than when we engage in big projects. The way my spirituality 
              is expressed today is through individual relationships. </p>
            <p>Our best service together, and our best preaching experience, is 
              a little programme that we have in our home. Once a week, we invite 
              friends, neighbours and Vaisnavas to come and chant, discuss spiritual 
              literature, and take <i>prasadam</i>. It's very powerful because 
              we connect with people on a one-to-one basis, heart-to-heart. This 
              gets me talking to people, find-ing out what is going on in their 
              life, perhaps offering some practical service or advice. It seems 
              small, but when you see how much devotees appreciate that kind of 
              help and rapport, you see that this is what it means for us to be 
              the servant of the servant. I would like it if being the servant 
              of the servant meant having a big position and a big title, and 
              a special seat at the Sunday feast, but for me, being the servant 
              of the servant means doing things like calling someone when they 
              get sick. </p>
            <p><i>Introducing people to Krsna </i></p>
            <p>Another realisation I've had is that everybody I meet can accept 
              at least some aspect of Krsna consciousness. Very few people I meet 
              can accept all of the aspects of Krsna conscious-ness. When I hear 
              the phrase 'make devotees', it often seems to mean to make people 
              into the image of what we think they should be. It took me some 
              time to realise that that is not our job. If I'm telling people 
              how wrong and bad they are, and how I can fix them, then it's all 
              about me. However, if I approach people with the idea of introducing 
              them to an aspect of Krsna consciousness that they can accept, then 
              we can begin a real relationship. For example, I used to try and 
              distribute <i>prasadam </i>in the mood of looking for appreciation 
              for being a devotee giving people this benefit. Very few people 
              would take the <i>prasadam</i>. However, I find that when I have 
              some relationship with people, when they see me as a person, even 
              if it's just the parking attendant or a cashier, then there's no 
              problem in distributing <i>prasadam</i>. That's one of the ways 
              that I try to express my spirituality: I bake something, take it 
              in the car with me, and pass it out to those I meet during the day. 
            </p>
            <p><i>It's not all bad </i></p>
            <p>A benefit of being a part of the wider, nondevotee community is 
              the different perspectives it offers on practical issues. Sometimes, 
              because they are so close to me, devotees may not be so objective 
              in their advice. It can be very useful to go to somebody outside 
              the devotional community, talk to them and get their feedback. It's 
              a little clearer sometimes. </p>
            <p>My children have also experienced this broader perspective. For 
              example, my son has always been in the world. Even during the few 
              years he did go to <i>gurukula </i>he had friends who weren't devotees. 
              He has always been quite apart from ISKCON. On a recent trip to 
              the <i>gurukula </i>in Vrndavana, one of the teachers commented 
              on how much of American culture my son had absorbed and how his 
              consciousness was affected; he didn't use the word contaminated, 
              but that was the word I heard. At first I felt defensive and a little 
              hurt by that, but after a while I came to be happy that he has an 
              understanding of both cultures. I know he wouldn't be happy living 
              in a temple <i>asrama</i>. He is not a <i>brahmacari </i>by nature. 
              He needs experience of both worlds, because he's going to live in 
              both worlds. He gets along with people well. He can go from community 
              to community, social group to social group, and he can make friends 
              with anybody. He's even friends with the red-necks at school and 
              with racist skinheads. He's friends with everybody because he's 
              had that multicultural experience. </p>

            <p>Sometimes devotees are apprehensive about appearing in Vaisnava 
              dress in public. Historically, it is not uncommon for a religion 
              that is new to a particular social environment to face issues about 
              social identification within the larger culture. The Salvation Army 
              is an interesting example. Like us, the Salvation Army were not 
              respected because they were making loud noises, walking up and down 
              the street, and getting in peoples' way. For many years they faced 
              persecution, prejudice and ignorance. </p>
            <p>The Salvation Army, although often seen only as a charity, is a 
              religion that grew out of the Methodist Church in nineteenth-century 
              England. Its founder was William Booth, formerly a Methodist minister. 
              Despite Booth's desire to preach to the downtrodden of London, the 
              Methodist church officers kept sending him to country parishes. 
              For some years Booth requested a change of assignment, and after 
              constant refusals, he and his wife started their own movement. </p>
            <p>Like us, they largely built their church from street sales of religious 
              magazines. Now the Salvation Army is the largest religiously affiliated 
              recipient of private donations in the United States. Last year they 
              received something like $365 million in donations. This is a religion 
              that a hundred years ago people didn't like or trust. In modern 
              terms it would have been described as a cult. </p>
            <p>Historically, many organisations get over these troubled beginnings; 
              but that takes internal action. An old friend of mine told me he 
              used to feel embarrassed to chant on the streets; people would laugh 
              at him. But then he thought, 'you may laugh now, but if you want 
              to get out of material life, you might have to do this too some 
              day'. That gave him some inner fortitude. </p>
            <p>Personally, I always travel with a <i>dhoti, </i>although I don't 
              always feel comfortable. I feel that if people at least think, 'hey 
              look, there's a Hare Krsna', then it's nice that they thought of 
              Krsna. But it would be even better if they said, 'Hey, there's a 
              Hare Krsna: they're the wonderful people who teach vegetarianism; 
              they have a fantastic philosophy; they raise wonderful families; 
              they're clean'. </p>
            <p>When I teach communication courses I try to emphasise that when 
              we take our vows, not only do we vow <i>not </i>to do four things 
              (take intoxicants, eat meat, engage in illicit sex, or gamble), 
              but simultaneously, and more importantly, we are vowing to <i>do 
              </i>four things; we're agreeing be truthful, clean, merciful, and 
              austere. We may be thinking we are following the regulative principles, 
              but are we following the positive side of the injunctions as well 
              as the negative? Are we clean, truthful, honest, personable? </p>
            <p>The four things we vow to avoid are the grossest manifestations 
              of what we consider irreligious activity. Acceptance of those values 
              is important. People really will appreciate us. I think we all feel 
              that pain in our hearts. It's a struggle to be proud to be a devotee. 
              We're proud, and then we're embarrassed. </p>
            <p>I'm not embarrassed by our philosophy; I'm embarrassed by misinterpretations 
              of the philosophy. It is very important for us to sit and discuss 
              what Prabhupada meant when he said certain things; why certain behaviours 
              exist; what is the proper way to do things; how we can we treat 
              each other better. We need to discuss what we can do to move forward 
              a little, individually or collectively. We have to take what we 
              have learned and carry it forward. </p>
            <p>Margaret Mead once advised that we shouldn't think that a small 
              group of committed people cannot change the world, because, indeed, 
              that's the only way the world has ever changed. Sometimes there 
              is a lot of questioning about when will ISKCON do this and when 
              will devotee communities do that? The real question is: when will 
              we find the potential in our own hearts to change ourselves and 
              others? As Prabhupada showed, it only takes one or two people to 
              make a difference. Prabhupada didn't wait for others. He tried to 
              get others involved, but when he didn't get much help, he went on 
              alone. </p>
            <p><i>People first </i></p>
            <p>Devotees in Russia wrote a declaration. Their main principle was 
              to take care of people first, that the projects should serve the 
              people. That's a very important principle. We often assume that 
              if we have successful projects, people will automatically be helped. 
              It wasn't that we didn't want to help people; so many of us gave 
              up everything because we saw that people have all these material 
              things and they are unhappy. We put aside all our material needs 
              in order to give people some spiritual answers. However, as Bhaktivinoda 
              Thakura said, there are two rails to the train track. </p>
            <p>Some devotees are trying to get the priorities right, to take care 
              of people. In communications analysis there is the idea of taking 
              care of your core community. If your core community is happy, then 
              everything else will work. If a mother and father are having problems, 
              the family is going to struggle. If a family is having problems, 
              the community is going to suffer. If the community is having problems, 
              the state is going to suffer. We have to start close to home. </p>
            <p>In some places we see that there have been lots of changes; for 
              example, the temple president leaves and then everything becomes 
              uncertain. What can happen in these situations is that members of 
              the congregation step forward and take responsibility for holding 
              the community together. The internal circle of concern, or circle 
              of influence, is where we can make changes. </p>
            <p><i>Valuing and involving all sections of our community </i></p>
            <p>In the past we faced many problems in caring for and facilitating 
              our women. There was a period in our history when temple leadership 
              was almost entirely comprised of celibate men. This led to an aversion 
              towards associating with women in any sphere. </p>
            <p>In the early 1990s, attitudes began to change when gurus with many 
              female disciples began to recognise that these women could also 
              be intelligent, mature members of the community who had a lot to 
              contribute. This change in perception of women quickly trickled 
              down, but not everywhere, and women were seen less as a threat to 
              devotional life and more as valued members of our society. </p>
            <p>I think that we are now at a similar stage with our congregations. 
              We now have many members of our congregations who are initiated; 
              are professionally educated; are highly knowledgeable people in 
              fields such as management, communications, medicine, social work 
              or engineering. They are faithful to Prabhupada and the <i>parampara</i>. 
              So when they start to exhibit some intelligence by noticing that 
              the philosophy is great but the management is awful, we should be 
              able to say, 'we're not threatened by that'. </p>
            <p><i>Organisation </i></p>
            <p>We're not afraid of the technology of laptop computers, so why 
              should we be afraid of the technology, the management skills, that 
              built the laptop computers? Skills that could help us better manage, 
              structure and inform our society. We talk about social welfare issues. 
              So why don't we look at systems that other organisations use - whether 
              it's the Mormon church or the US government - to make sure there 
              is a social network for their members? Why is it that certain technologies 
              are safe and others aren't? We need to learn from experts. </p>
            <p>One way in which we can tap into these technologies is by becoming 
              involved in relevant activities and organisations in the larger 
              society. We can learn from these groups and bring the lessons to 
              our own communities, and at the same time we can use our Krsna conscious 
              principles to influence what is going on in the larger society. 
            </p>
            <p>In Christian circles they talk of the parent church and the parallel 
              church. For example, there is the Catholic Church, and then there 
              are Catholic welfare services. These welfare services are independent 
              of the Catholic Church, but they subscribe to the values and teachings 
              of the Catholic Church and use their Catholic inspiration to go 
              and make a difference in the world. There are devotees who are very 
              interested in this model; they see the need for independent, grass-roots 
              structures that are affiliated with, friendly to, or supportive 
              of ISKCON but that don't necessarily <i>belong </i>to ISKCON. Children 
              of Krishna is a somewhat successful example of this. It accomplishes 
              its goals independently of ISKCON, but it is there to benefit ISKCON 
              devotees. We don't have to be one organisation; we can be many organisations. 
              We live in a world full of organisations. </p>
            <p><i>Inspiring new members </i></p>
            <p>An important challenge for all of us, individually and as communities, 
              is to inspire people when they want to be part of ISKCON. This is 
              a big challenge to parents, senior devotees, community leaders, 
              teachers, and certainly for the national and international leaders. 
              We have to ask: 'Why would someone want to be part of ISKCON?' </p>
            <p>For many of us who went through what I call the 'radical conversion 
              experience', we have the sense that you simply have to become Krsna 
              conscious because that's what's right. That's not very deep for 
              a lot of people. </p>
            <p>We have to understand what people need, what interests them, and 
              how we are providing for these needs and interests. It's not that 
              everybody is going to want or like every aspect of Krsna consciousness, 
              so we have to find what it is about Krsna consciousness that people 
              will appreciate, and how we can share that with them. At the Vaisnava 
              Family and Youth Conference we heard from our young people for the 
              first time in years. What do young people need to be inspired to 
              be devotees? We won't get very far saying, 'you should do this because 
              you should'. That doesn't work in any context. Why should they want 
              to be devotees? Are we providing them with reasons why they can't 
              imagine anything but being in ISKCON? </p>
            <p>That's the real challenge. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Dhira Govinda Dasa </p>
            <p>We've learned that most of our youth are going to interact in the 
              secular world. There may be a few who are temple devotees their 
              whole life and who won't need to interact extensively in the secular 
              world. Practically all of our youth are going to have some vocation 
              or relationship in the secular world. To ignore this would show 
              that we're out of touch and don't really care. </p>
            <p><i>Four levels of interaction </i></p>
            <p>Devotees have different levels of interaction with the secular 
              world. </p>
            <p>One such level is represented by the devotee who is out in the 
              world. His colleagues know that he is a devotee; they see that he 
              is contributing to society, that he's a good worker, and that he's 
              a responsible person. The colleagues of such a devotee become favourable: 
              'Oh, so the Hare Krsnas don't just dance on the street.' Of course, 
              <i>harinama </i>is at the core of our mission, but many nondevotees 
              perceive it as being something strange. Prabhupada writes that someone 
              who is favourable makes advancement. Just by someone becoming favour-able, 
              their spiritual life moves forward. </p>
            <p>Another level of interaction is to be in the world and actively 
              be Krsna conscious and give that to others. He may discuss the philosphy 
              with interested people or he may distribute <i>prasadam. </i>At 
              this level he is not just a devotee setting a responsible example, 
              he is also giving Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p>Some may want to do more than that. Srila Prabhupada wanted us 
              to show the relevance of Krsna consciousness, of spiritual life, 
              to every field. We need to consider the mission. What about pleasing 
              the great <i>acaryas</i>? What about continuing the mission of the 
              <i>parampara</i>? I see that as a higher stage: where devotees are 
              in the world as good members of society and are also showing the 
              practical relevance of Krsna consciousness in every field, whether 
              it's business, politics, agriculture, or academia. </p>
            <p>Further than that, we have chosen Krsna consciousness for a reason; 
              we see that it has some special attributes, that it's especially 
              profound. We want to show that anything good in a particular field 
              finds its perfection in Krsna consciousness. Of course, we do that 
              in a way that is in accordance with time and circumstance, and we 
              present Krsna consciousness in a way that is acceptable and palatable. 
            </p>
            <p><i>Applying a Vedic perspective to Western social sciences </i></p>
            <p>Before I joined the movement in the 1980s, I had a degree in psychology. 
              In the early 1990s I found myself in academia again. I had been 
              working in social work and undertook a Mas-ters degree in social 
              work. Devotees find themselves in academia for various reasons: 
              some for economic reasons, some for preaching, and some because 
              that's what they like best. </p>
            <p>While studying, I tried to infuse my papers with Krsna consciousness 
              where possible. I found that the professors were very impressed 
              with the knowledge that was coming from Prabhupada's books. There 
              was one assignment that seemed rather uninteresting. We were supposed 
              to analyse some administrative structure. So I tried to infuse my 
              paper with some concepts from the Vedic model of the administration 
              of society, but without mentioning <i>varnasrama</i>, <i>brahmanas, 
              </i>or <i>ksatriyas</i>. The professor, a very senior man in his 
              field, was enthusiastic. It was a new and different experience for 
              him, and he went on to encourage me to undertake PhD study. </p>
            <p>The social sciences are generally a very important sector in a 
              university. Universities are often divided into three main sectors: 
              the social sciences, the physical sciences and the humanities. We 
              have devotees establishing Vaisnavism in all those areas. </p>
            <p><i>In practice </i></p>
            <p>My dissertation was on the effects of the <i>maha-mantra </i>on 
              stress, depression, and the three <i>gunas </i>(the three modes 
              of nature: goodness, passion, and ignorance). </p>
            <p>We devised a personality inventory based on these modes. We used 
              700 subjects, all nondevotees, as we thought that the devotees may 
              have been prejudiced in their responses. </p>
            <p>In our study on the effects of chanting the <i>maha-mantra</i>, 
              we did a rigorous experiment using the latest technologies and methodologies 
              for research design, measurement, meas-urement sampling, and statistical 
              analysis, helped by trained and qualified assistants. We had three 
              groups, each of which took a pretest, post-test, and follow-up. 
              There was a control group, the members of which did not chant anything; 
              there was a <i>maha-mantra </i>group; and there was a mock-mantra 
              group. I invented a mock-mantra, but I told the group that it was 
              a real mantra. The idea was to present the <i>maha-mantra </i>in 
              an academic framework, using academic methodology and terminology. 
            </p>
            <p>Although this is only my experience in this particular sector, 
              other devotees are also introducing Krsna consciousness into the 
              academic world. For example, a devotee youth, Ragunatha Dasa, is 
              developing a very worthy project showing the economic viability 
              and the economic advantages of each of the four regulative principles. 
              Devotees talk about this during <i>Bhagavatam </i>class, but to 
              convince the scholarly world of these ideas and to introduce these 
              ideas to the wider society, which is enamoured by empiricism, we 
              need to do research. Most Vaisnava practices lend themselves to 
              empirical research. Krsna says that the truths revealed in the Vedic 
              scriptures can be directly experienced; these truths are empirically 
              verifiable. Dhira Dasi is considering writing her dissertation on 
              the empirical effects of <i>prasadam</i>. The effects of <i>prasadam 
              </i>could be studied empirically by organising a <i>prasadam </i>group 
              and a vegetarian control group, and then measuring various effects. 
            </p>
            <p>We don't chant Hare Krsna or do <i>bhakti-yoga </i>to decrease 
              our stress and depression; these are side benefits. But people are 
              really interested in decreasing their stress and depression and 
              having less marital conflict; all of these effects are dependent 
              variables, and through empirical studies we can show the relevance 
              of the Vaisnava practices to the world. The philosophy of Krsna 
              consciousness offers a framework by which we can understand sociological 
              and psychological phenomena. There's a lot of work for devotees 
              - not just living in the secular world to earn a livelihood but 
              to push forward Prabhupada's movement in every field. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Citralekha Devi Dasi<br>
              Raising devotee children in the wider society </p>
            <p>When I joined ISKCON, it was 'give up everything and become a Hare 
              Krsna devotee'. Srila Prabhupada gave my husband, Upendra Dasa, 
              and I some gifts in his direction to us. He was cultivating us to 
              go travelling, preaching and opening centres. He gave us the opportunity 
              to do things independently and to have firm faith in the philosophy. 
              Because we were often sent to remote places by ourselves, we learned 
              to internalise our dependence on Krsna. Once we mentioned this to 
              him: 'But Prabhupada, there aren't any devotees there'. He said 
              all you need is two. So that was our training in Krsna consciousness. 
              Throughout the years, we always had that independence. Some devotees 
              might have classified us as 'fringies'. We didn't always live in 
              a temple, or if we did, it was in India, where we were rather autonomous 
              anyway. </p>
            <p>In the 1980s, when the financial bases of the temples fell out, 
              many devotees had to start working to support their families. My 
              husband, as much of a Prabhupada lover and fol-lower that he was, 
              was no longer involved in Krsna consciousness directly, and, although 
              he held Prabhupada dear to his heart, being a supportive father 
              and husband wasn't one of his strong points. I was left to raise 
              my children on my own. During this time it took a lot of heavy decision 
              making and faith in order to push on. </p>
            <p>I knew my children would have to work in the wider society and 
              that they would need to know how to relate to all kinds of people, 
              so they started in public school. This was traumatic for them, and 
              it was traumatic for me to find work because I didn't have a degree 
              or any work experience in the outside world. I had never written 
              a résumé or had a job interview. I was starting from nothing at 
              the age of forty with three dependent children. </p>
            <p>Also, after my children came back from boarding <i>gurukula</i>, 
              we didn't have a very strong relationship with each other. My motherly 
              instincts kicked in right away: I had to focus on their relationships; 
              take care of their needs; make sure they got an education, and that 
              they got Prabhupada. If that was all I could do, then that was my 
              service. It was difficult, and sometimes I felt I wasn't able to 
              do all of the spiritual practices that I wanted to. I had to have 
              faith that the instructions that I had given my children when they 
              were young would help carry them through some of the difficulties 
              that we were going to encounter along the way. I felt very strong. 
            </p>
            <p>I taught <i>gurukula </i>for eleven years and was one of the teachers 
              who was always pushing for a regular, outside curriculum. I felt 
              our <i>gurukula </i>curriculum was insufficient, that it wasn't 
              really giving the children the education they needed. It was a little 
              radical of me at the time, but I felt that if we had faith in our 
              philosophy and we gave our children that philosophy, then it didn't 
              matter so much what textbooks we used; the philosophy would prevail. 
            </p>
            <p>So, with those lessons in mind, we proceeded. There were some very 
              difficult years. My son had a lot of resentment because of his difficulties 
              in <i>gurukula</i>. As the only parent present, he blamed me for 
              all of that. We struggled through many years, but we hung in there. 
              I resolved that my children weren't going to have the philosophy 
              shoved down their throat. I saw many youths leaving and not wanting 
              to be a part of ISKCON, so I resolved that I wasn't going to force 
              anything upon my children. If they wanted to know, I was willing 
              to tell them. I gave them all the direction I could based on the 
              philosophy, and if they wanted to, they could remember it and keep 
              it with them. </p>
            <p>Now we have come full circle. My son appreciates a lot of the philosophy, 
              and we've resolved our relationship. He holds Prabhupada and his 
              early training years dear to his heart. I don't know whether he 
              actively practices, and I don't ask, but I do know that when I go 
              to his apartment, I see his <i>japa </i>beads there and a <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 
              and he wears his neck beads. If that's what he can do, then that's 
              great. As for my older daughter, her heart is there, even if her 
              practices aren't the best. My younger daughter is still striving, 
              so we're in that area where she doesn't know where she's at. She 
              plops back and forth, and if her friends think Hare Krsnas are weird, 
              then she doesn't want to have anything to do with devotees. We're 
              still working through that. </p>
            <p>During all these changes, I came to a point at which I felt like 
              I was drying up inside. I needed something to give me some spirituality, 
              some strength. So I started going back to school. I needed an outlet 
              for spiritual exchange, and that really provided it. Interestingly, 
              the first instructor I had at Penn State, my world religions professor, 
              had practised Tibetan Buddhism for twenty years. We had many lengthy 
              discussions. I invited him to the temple, and his first response 
              was: 'I don't want you to convert me'. I was constantly battling 
              that stereotype that we were just out to convert. All of my papers 
              were infused with Krsna conscious philosophy. It was really my outlet 
              for giving the philosophy to others without men-tioning Krsna, without 
              mentioning <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>, or without any of the devotee 
              clichés. I was able to give our outlook on the world, and my instructors 
              loved it. It was very satisfying, and it really opened up my life 
              in many ways. It made me realise very quickly that everything I 
              knew had been taught to me by Srila Prabhupada. That was my world 
              view, and this was how I was able to give something back to Prabhupada: 
              by offering others a little of what I had learned from him. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Questions </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Question from Anuttama Dasa: </p>
            <p>How do we take Srila Prabhupada's statements, some of which appear 
              to be quite negative, about interacting with the world? Prabhupada 
              talks of people 'working hard like dogs, hogs, camels, and asses'. 
              He sometimes describes people who get degrees as being like stray 
              dogs looking for a master. We hear nondevotee schools described 
              as slaughterhouses. We hear Prabhupada talk about the danger of 
              associating with nondevotees. Many people get these negative impressions 
              from Prabhupada's books. How do we reconcile that with the idea 
              of devotees getting degrees, looking for work, and holding regular 
              jobs? How do we balance that with being Krsna conscious? Have we 
              given up? Have we sold out? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Response<br>
              Dhira Govinda Dasa: </p>
            <p>We can look at our place in the world as a <i>sankirtana </i>spot, 
              somewhere to talk about Krsna consciousness. I'm writing an academic 
              paper, so this is <i>sankirtana</i>. Yes, we do have these state-ments 
              in Prabhupada's books about dogs, hogs, camels and asses, but Prabhupada 
              also said that in Vaisnava philosophy everything is Krsna's energy. 
              If we reject Krsna's energy, then we are impersonalists. The question 
              then is: if everything is Krsna's energy, how can I use it in Krsna's 
              service? How can I use Krsna's energy in such a way that Prabhupada 
              and the <i>acaryas </i>will be pleased. If I'm unable to use it 
              properly, then I probably shouldn't be in that situation. But I 
              see that Krsna put me in this particular position for a reason. 
              Krsna put me in university for a reason. Krsna has me writing these 
              papers for a reason. How can I take something that's material and 
              'Krsna-ise' it, spiritualise it, and thus make the world a more 
              spiritual place? </p>
            <p>The statements you mentioned are a warning: whenever we are in 
              contact with the material energy, which is essentially all the time, 
              we need to be on guard. We need to be very vigilant about our own 
              Krsna consciousness, but we also need to remember Prabhupada's example. 
              Prabhupada didn't stay in Vaisnava Vrndavana; he created Krsna conscious 
              association. </p>
            <p>There are levels of association with the world. The first level 
              is to be in a situation and to show by behaviour that devotees are 
              good people. The next level is to share some spiritual knowledge, 
              to make Krsna consciousness relevant, and to openly practice aspects 
              of Krsna consciousness. If I'm out there and I'm not showing how 
              Krsna consciousness is relevant, then I'm probably going to be influenced 
              by the situation rather than exerting influence. </p>
            <p>Prabhupada gives different statements to warn us, but also statements 
              to encourage us. Everything is Krsna's energy. How can I 'Krsna-ise' 
              this office? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Comment<br>
              Braja Bihari Dasa: </p>
            <p>We have to be very careful because Prabhupada is quoted very selectively 
              in our society. We have to step back and look at the gamut of Prabhupada's 
              teachings on a certain topic and try to understand them on a deeper 
              level, rather than just quoting something off the cuff. To some 
              extent, in our society, there has been a kind of railroading, based 
              on selective quotes, to think that this is Prabhupada on a certain 
              topic. Often, a more mature, detached, and broad-based research 
              would deepen our understanding and bring us beyond superficial views. 
              What is the context in which Prabhupada says something? Who is it 
              being said to? How does one statement compare with other statements 
              on the same subject? We need to be much more levelheaded and look 
              a little more deeply into the teachings to present a better balance. 
            </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Question from audience: </p>
            <p>How do we know that it's Krsna, not <i>maya </i>(illusion) or our 
              own material desires that puts us in a situation? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Response<br>
              Dhira Govinda Dasa: </p>
            <p>Well, maybe it is my material desire, my karma, or <i>maya</i>, 
              that puts me in a particular situation, but wherever we are, the 
              question is, how can I act in a way that's pleasing to Prabhupada? 
              How can I be Krsna conscious here? Maybe I'm not here for all the 
              right reasons, but for whatever reasons I am here, Krsna wants me 
              to be spiritual. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Question from Pancaratra Dasa: </p>
            <p>Do we face an issue of entitlement in our society, based on past 
              service? Do some of us feel that because we have given so much to 
              the Krsna consciousness movement, we are entitled to earn a living 
              without regard to normal ethical standards? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Response<br>
              Rukmini Devi Dasi: </p>
            <p>Yes, and then we passed that ethic on to the next generation of 
              devotees and that's become our society's norm and ethic. That is 
              a cause for tears. </p>
            <p>Our children are imbibing that kind of behaviour by osmosis. They 
              grow up thinking this is normal. There is a feeling that 'I should 
              be entitled to receive something that is beyond my means' or 'I 
              can do anything to feed my family. They are, after all, devotees, 
              so it is transcendental'. With these attitudes we can tell any lie 
              to make a living. We can say we are getting kids off drugs or feeding 
              the poor. This lack of integrity creates a subculture that is very 
              scary. </p>
            <p>Our children often see this instead of an honest and humble endeavour 
              to work at an honest job. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Question from audience </p>
            <p>How does our behaviour affect the way the public sees us? </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Response <br>
              Rukmini Devi Dasi: </p>
            <p>Recently, I read a story in <i>Newsweek </i>about the Mormons. 
              The article starts off: 'What do you think of when you think of 
              a Mormon?' What <i>do </i>you think of? You think of honest, clean-cut 
              kids in pairs going out across the world preaching their religion. 
              It's a question we have to ask of ourselves: 'What do you think 
              of when you think of a Hare Krsna?' Unfortunately, I find the answers 
              to this question are scary, even terrifying. We had the opportunity 
              to study with Srila Prabhupada and read his books, and somehow, 
              despite all that, we have given the public a very negative perception 
              of our movement. We have to be able to change that now. We can't 
              wait another ten, twenty, or fifty years. </p>
            <p>I recently spoke with a devotee who is very brahminically inclined; 
              a very scholarly, fine devotee, for whom I have a lot of respect. 
              He has been selling hats for years, and he is miserable. As we were 
              talking, I was describing the Bhaktivedanta College, which is planned 
              for Radhadesh, and suggested he look at it as a place to go and 
              study or teach or somehow be involved with. He went to the Communications 
              Seminars there in July 2001, and that opened up whole new vistas 
              for him. It gave him hope that that maybe there is some way for 
              him to work according to his natural tendencies. </p>
            <p>Of course, it's not that we all have to be involved in academic 
              life, but we do all have to look at our own propensities, and the 
              reputation of Prabhupada's mission. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Comment by Radha Devi Dasi: </p>
            <p>This issue affects the type of new people coming to join our movement. 
              When people look at our movement and think about joining, they generally 
              don't sit down and literally look at the philosophy. Very few people 
              will look at the philosophy and think they would like to change 
              their lives to fit the philosophy. They do look at the people in 
              the movement and question if they see themselves doing that. If 
              all they see is <i>brahmacaris</i>, then we will attract a lot of 
              people who want to be <i>brahmacaris</i>. If there is a strong subculture 
              of people who take and sell drugs, then we will attract more of 
              that type of person. If they see devotees who can work in the world, 
              then we will attract that kind of person. </p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Comment by Anuttama Dasa: </p>
            <p>One issue that we as a society have to address is to define what 
              is acceptable behaviour and what is unacceptable behaviour. It's 
              true, there are many stories of famous and respectable people who 
              went through some very difficult times and who then turned to Christianity 
              later in life and gave up their erring ways. But as a society, what 
              is our social norm? There are many questions that come from this. 
              Is it okay in an emergency to break ethical rules? Do we accept 
              some of the ethical principles that are there in the larger society? 
              Or are we above that? Are we able to set our own standards? </p>
            <p>It seems in our society the real unacceptable behaviour is to work 
              hard for eight hours a day, six days a week, with a humble income. 
              It is seen as better to do something that isn't entirely straightforward 
              for four hours a day and make more money. It is a problem that has 
              seeped into our society and needs to be weeded out. In <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, 
              Prabhupada says that it is better to be an honest street sweeper 
              than a charlatan meditator. Prabhupada also says that if one has 
              a very menial job but is meditating on the fact that the fruit of 
              his work is for Krsna, then that can be pure devotional service. 
            </p>
            <p>This is a critically important point. What is our ethic? We have 
              to balance our needs to maintain our bodies and our families, but 
              also we have to try and be Krsna conscious. </p>
            <p>There is the example of Kholaveca Sridhara that Rukmini mentioned 
              from <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i>. He was earning a pauper's income 
              from selling banana leaves, yet he is glorified in the <i>sastra</i>. 
              He would rather live humbly from banana leaf sales than compromise 
              his morals. We need to build a social network and a support network 
              in which we help our fellow Vaisnavas make an honest living. We've 
              been trying to dosomething like this with our youth. There may be 
              limited resources, but at least we have to understand that we need 
              to do something there. We need to build that support network and 
              at the same time define and make clear what constitutes unacceptable 
              behaviour. </p>
            <p>We have to develop an unbreakable ethic of being honest and truthful 
              in representing Prabhupada's movement to society, even if that means 
              we have to work a little harder or a little below our means. If 
              we don't do this now, these unacceptable behaviours get passed on 
              to the next generation and become very difficult to weed out. </p>
