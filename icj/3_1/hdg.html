            <p><i>Hridayananda Dasa Goswami shows us in this article, by analysis 
              of a specific piece of scholarly research by Prof. W. Rau, how academic 
              conclusions may sometimes be based on personal bias. Such bias does 
              not lead to objective conclusions and it defeats the methodology 
              used to gain objectivity. As explored in The First Indologists, 
              by Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, scholarly research into Indian and Asian 
              religion is littered with such conclusion. It is important, as Hrisdayananda 
              Dasa Goswami demonstrates here, for members of the living traditions 
              to learn to communicate with scholars. This will develop healthy 
              debate and add balance to the study of Eastern religion and help 
              us develop wholistic conclusions based on representations of the 
              experience from the tradition and the analysis of the observer.</i></p>
            <p>In a pioneering work, <i>State and Society in Ancient India<a href="#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" title="">[i] </a> </i>Prof. Wilhelm Rau attempts, through a scholarly 
              study of ancient Vedic literature generally known as the <i>Brahmana 
              </i>texts, to reconstruct the political and social situation of 
              early India. Yet even while gratefully acknowledging our debt to 
              him, we shall critically evaluate certain basic and explicit assumptions 
              that guided his selective listing and interpretation of the <i>Brahmana</i> 
              texts, and which thus let him to construct a historical picture 
              consistent with those assumptions.</p>
            <p> Rau begins by admitting that, 'the title of the present investigation 
              (<i>State and Society in Ancient India</i>) will, without doubt, 
              provoke amazement in many readers. After all, it is held far and 
              away as an accepted fact that the Aryan Indians of the early antiquity 
              had formed no States.' </p>
            <p> This is true, argues Rau, only if we understand state or government 
              in the modern sense. However our concern here is with state in the 
              most general, universal sense of the term, and, Rau claims, since 
              the pundits of political science have failed to give us this most 
              general definition of state, he turns rather to anthropology, and 
              thus derives the following argument:</p>
            <p>(1) Human beings belong to the 'herd-animals'.</p>
            <p>(2) Like other creatures of this group, humans depend on differentiated 
              social structures for both physical wellbeing and mental development.</p>
            <p>(3) Thus, and here Rau quotes Eduard Meyer, 'the organisation in 
              such groups (herds, tribes) which we empirically encounter wherever 
              we learn about human beings, is not only just as old, but rather 
              far older than human beings: it is the pre-condition for the arising 
              of mankind at all.'</p>
            <p>(4) This implies some form of legal system, which need not be a 
              written one, since, according to Meyer, 'without a legal order, 
              or in other words a generally recognised and steadfast regulation 
              of its external formation, of its authority and position in relation 
              to the individual, even the most primitive tribal group is unthinkable, 
              for without such a system, it would be nothing but an ephemeral 
              union of autonomous individuals.' </p>
            <p>Rau happily concludes that 'The state as a legal system of co-existence 
              is found thus everywhere and at every stage of human history.' </p>
            <p> Rau then adds the following refinements to his argument: although 
              an individual often owes allegiance to many social groups, including 
              family, professional groups, cults, etc., 'that community which 
              the individual feels himself most duty-bound to obey', is entitled 
              to be called the 'state' for that individual. 'This authority, however, 
              has only as much meaning as it has power to enforce its claims on 
              the individuals. Mere pious sentiments, customs or moral commandments 
              cannot sustain a legal system. The state authority rests on the 
              state power and this power must in some way be represented, be it 
              through aristocratic oligarchic groups, or through a general people's 
              assembly.'</p>
            <p> We are now ready for Rau's final working definition of the state 
              in its most general contour: 'The state is the most authoritative 
              social or community form of its time among human beings who consider 
              themselves to belong together. It is internally a legal system valid 
              for all its members (but not therefore equally necessary for all).'</p>
            <p> Rau is attempting to set up a type of evolutionary stage model 
              for state development in India. Thus he needs to show that early 
              Indian legal systems or state-forms were quite simple, even animalistic, 
              and only later developed into the more complex forms associated 
              with current notions of government. He reminds us that his simple 
              definition is remarkable for the items it does not contain: 'First 
              of all (for a definition of a state to be valid): states can be 
              conceived in relation with any form of economy. We cannot assign 
              a minimum number of participants in the state. It remains open whether 
              through descent, language, customs or religion they see each other 
              as belonging together. Equality under the law and a written fixing 
              of the law may be lacking.'</p>
            <p> Having defined the 'state' for the purpose of his study as a universal 
              feature of human and even of animal life, and having committed himself 
              to an anthropological / evolutionary stage model for the development 
              of early Indian government and social structure, Rau next discusses 
              his sources. He laments that unlike the sources for other areas 
              and periods, the early Indian context 'yields considerable difficulties. 
              Here any sure chronology is missing.' </p>
            <p> Indeed, rather than a coherent sequence of historical events linked 
              to verifiable dates, we have merely 'the fact that older and younger 
              types of literature are succeeding one another, redefining and conditioning 
              one another'. Rau concedes that these ancient literatures could 
              be analysed through three methods: </p>
            <p>(1) Philological review which seeks to establish a relative chronology 
              of the texts.</p>
            <p>(2) An historical linguistic study which seeks the same result 
              through statistical analysis of vocabulary, grammar and syntax. 
            </p>
            <p>(3) The method which Rau himself utilised, that of cultural history, 
              which 'tries to include for the dating and the development of living 
              conditions, by utilising what the sources say about the conditions 
              of that time.' </p>
            <p>Rau next divides the Vedic texts into the three traditional categories 
              of <i>Samhitas, Brahmanas </i>(including some early <i>Upanisads</i>) 
              and <i>Sutras. </i>There are, however, several problems with this 
              scheme:</p>
            <p>(1)  Since the 1950s,when Rau wrote this work, our periodisation 
              of Vedic literature has been enhanced and made more precise by the 
              work of scholars such as Michael Witzel who sees, in his article 
              'Tracing the Vedic Dialects', five, rather than three, strata of 
              Vedic texts:</p>
            <p>(a)  the <i>Rig-veda</i>, which Witzel sees as the oldest linguistic 
              strata of Vedic literature, in a category by itself;</p>
            <p>(b) the mantra language, including the verse and the pose texts 
              of the <i>Atharva-veda, </i>the <i>Rig-veda-khilani, </i>the seventy-five 
              mantras of the <i>Sama-veda Samhita </i>which are not found in the 
              <i>Rig Veda, </i>and the verse and prose mantras of the <i>Yajur 
              Veda</i>;<i></i></p>
            <p>(c) the <i>Samhita</i> prose of the <i>Yajur Veda, </i>which differs 
              from the 'mantra-language' in such features as the total loss of 
              the injunctive 'as a living category', the loss of the subjunctive, 
              optative and imperative modes of the aorist, and the appearance 
              of periphrastic aorist forms;</p>
            <p>(d) the <i>Brahmana</i> prose of the <i>Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama 
              Veda</i> and <i>Atharva Veda, </i>including the earlier and later 
              strata. Witzel also inserts here the 'older <i>Upanisads</i>' such 
              as the <i>Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad, Chandogya Upanisad</i> and <i>Jaiminiya 
              Upanisad Brahmana, </i>and also includes in this fourth strata 'some 
              of the oldest <i>Srauta Sutras</i>';</p>
            <p>(e) s<i>utra</i> language, including 'the bulk of the <i>Srauta</i> 
              and <i>Grihya Sutras</i>', forms the fifth and final strata.</p>
            <p>(2) Furthermore, since the publication of <i>Staat und Gesellschaft</i>,<i> 
              </i>Witzel and others have seriously attempted to locate the various 
              Vedic schools in specific geographic areas. Rau, writing in the 
              1950s, makes no mention or use of any such techniques. </p>
            <p>(3) In general, Rau only distinguishes between 'younger' and 'older' 
              texts, but even this technique is applied only (if often) when Rau 
              needs to bolster his speculative evolutionary stage model. In other 
              words, Rau does not systematically segregate the data from various 
              linguistic strata, geographic regions, type of literature (i.e. 
              <i>Brahmana</i> vs. <i>Upanisad</i>) or according to the various 
              Vedic schools.</p>
            <p>(4) Since Rau is anxious, as he repeatedly states, to purify his 
              work of excessive talk on religion, he does not recognise that the 
              texts reveal a variety of religious attitudes which themselves suggest 
              a variety of motives and programs among the different texts, or 
              indeed in the various sections of a single text. Rau seems content, 
              as we shall demonstrate, to relegate (with more than a little scorn) 
              all of the <i>Brahmana</i> theology to the category of primitive 
              magic.</p>
            <p>In fairness to Rau, we should mention that he openly classifies 
              his work as a preliminary venture into new territory, and that he 
              expects subsequent scholars to refine and develop this work. In 
              any case, we shall proceed through the text of <i>Staat und Gesellschaft 
              </i>and point out various arguments or claims which, in my view, 
              need to be scrutinised in terms of the four problems listed above.</p>
            <p> While discussing the contempt that European scholars have typically 
              felt for the <i>Brahmana</i> texts, Rau remarks:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The <i>Brahmanas</i> enjoy, at least with some Western indologists, 
                a rather questionable reputation: they have been compared to the 
                writings of the mentally retarded. They are characterised by monotony 
                in the content as well as helplessness in form and with their 
                abstruse identifications and mysterious nonsense give us an idea 
                of the first attempts at thinking and speaking of the oldest Indian 
                theologians. The authors are still completely unable to construct 
                longer sequences of thought; the shortest sentences seem to be 
                set next to each other without any relation; logical affirmations 
                are almost unknown; statements of a rational type of observation, 
                barely formulated, get lost again in the wavy chaos of crazy magical 
                ideas, where everything seems to flow in separate directions and 
                merge together at the same time.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Let us consider some of the above assertions. Rau assures us that 
              'the authors are still completely unable to construct longer sequences 
              of thought', and yet these texts are said to have been composed 
              long after the exquisite poetry of the <i>Rig-veda, </i>which does 
              indeed contain sentences of normal length, as well as a style of 
              composition and complexity of ideas of extraordinary literary and 
              religious merit. In terms of grammar, the <i>Rig-veda </i>displays 
              a rather sophisticated system of verbs which was understandably 
              simplified in later Sanskrit. Thus what does Rau mean when he says, 
              'the authors are still completely unable to construct longer sequences 
              of thought'?</p>
            <p> One would rather be led to postulate an age of advanced literary 
              and conceptual ability which later deteriorated into the culture 
              in which the <i>Brahmanas</i> were composed. One might also argue 
              that since the <i>Brahmanas </i>are precisely '<i>brahmanas</i> 
              speaking to <i>brahmanas</i>' and not to the general public, what 
              we have are a series of notes of the inner circle. Or perhaps the 
              coherence and syntactic significance of the seemingly unrelated 
              pieces of utterance were known to the Vedic technocrats who worked 
              the sacrificial fires. In that case, we might be dealing with a 
              jargon or technical meta-language, or perhaps even with linguistic 
              icons analogous to the visual ones on a computer screen, and which 
              contributed to a virtual reality in the form of <i>yajna.</i></p>
            <p> On the other hand, if we are attached to an evolutionary stage 
              model, all of the above possibilities will hold little interest 
              for us, and we will prefer to see primitive magicians speaking like 
              intoxicated children. But in that case, how are we to explain the 
              reality of an older, and superior strata of literature which, in 
              my view is clearly the product of a highly developed religious and 
              intellectual culture.</p>
            <p> Interestingly, Rau himself hints at such a possible 'devolution 
              in the religious life of the Aryans', when he says that (in the 
              <i>Brahmana</i> texts) 'one speculates on the meaning of the sacrifice 
              as a magical means to influence the course of worldly events. The 
              gods are being dethroned and degraded to impersonal forces, which 
              are meant to be used as order-suppliers'. </p>
            <p> In his well-known work, <i>The Religion of the Veda </i>(Delhi, 
              1988:8), H. Oldenberg sees a similar, and even earlier, transformation 
              on the historical path from the <i>Rig-veda </i>to the <i>Yajur-veda:</i></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The contribution of the <i>Yajus-</i>formulas to the understanding 
                of the Vedic gods is, of course, negligible compared to that of 
                the <i>Rig-veda. </i>The gods are here subordinate. One has the 
                impression that they are placed just here and there as accessories, 
                not quite in place. And, therefore, what they have to do accidentally 
                in the context of the sacrificial act has a very loose connection 
                with their real nature. For the compilers of the <i>Yajus</i> 
                this aspect of the gods has faded altogether. On the whole compared 
                with the <i>prime of the Vedic theistic belief </i>(emphasis mine), 
                there is obviously a fresher approach to these mantras which has 
                asserted itself over the old form of sacrifice: a philosophy for 
                which, heaven and earth, inhaling and exhaling, human senses and 
                powers and verse-measures are as important as, or perhaps more 
                important than, Indra and Varuna.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The affinities of this 'fresher approach' with the anti-theism 
              of the <i>purva-mimamsa </i>should be obvious. Indeed, Rau complains 
              that the <i>Brahmanas</i> give us mere mechanistic magic, rather 
              than faithful belief which Oldenberg sees in the earlier <i>Rig-veda. 
              </i>If we combine this fact with the obvious literary deterioration 
              that seems to take place between the <i>Rig-veda </i>and the <i>Brahmana</i> 
              texts, one should rather be led to a theory of devolution in Vedic 
              religion. But Rau does not consider this point.</p>
            <p> Rau gives a standard introduction to the 'Aryan colonisation of 
              North India', and rather than focus on the well-known details of 
              that theory, we shall examine some curious aspects of his methodology. 
              It seems that Rau consistently imagines what life must have been 
              like in olden times, and then brings in quotations (which only vaguely 
              or indirectly speak to the point) as confirmation of his view. For 
              example: ' . the different (migrating Aryan) tribes had to defend 
              their land not only against the attacks of the indigenous population 
              that was leaving towards the East, but also against their own kind 
              attacking and following in their footsteps (from the west).' In 
              defence of this, he cites the <i>Sata-patha-brahmana </i>(6,7,3,5): 
              'If one is actually victorious only with the opposite side, then 
              the land that he has conquered will be settled by others. Whoever, 
              on the other hand, is victorious on both sides is unhampered there.'</p>
            <p> Here we have a case in which a simple statement of military commonsense, 
              namely that one must secure one's border on both sides, has been 
              mobilised as a demonstration of presumed historical events and social-political 
              realities: namely that later bands of migrating Aryans attacked 
              and raided the land-holdings seized by previous bands of marauding 
              migratory.</p>
            <p> Rau seems wont to state his historical speculations as the only 
              possible way in which things might have happened, even when that 
              is obviously not the case. For instance, he claims that during the 
              time of the <i>Brahmana</i> literature, 'there were no names of 
              the land; where we are dealing with tribal lands, the sources use 
              the names of the inhabitants. He gives as examples from the texts 
              such names as Kosala, Vidha, Pancala, Madra and Kuru, concluding 
              that 'This way of expression has continued to exist in India until 
              far into the Middle Ages, and is very ancient: <i>it could only 
              have developed in a time where each individual tribe didn't yet 
              possess any area of settlement, and called that country its own 
              where it happened to be at the moment.</i>" (emphasis mine)</p>
            <p> I find this argument puzzling. First of all, I find the ancient 
              Indian custom of naming the land after the people to be elegant 
              and meaningful. Yet for Rau, 'there were no names of the land'. 
              Or, a name is not a name unless it is different from the name of 
              the people who live on it. To me, this argument is in no way intuitive 
              or logical. Although Rau somewhat frivolously claims that things 
              'could only have happened in a particular way when by the common 
              rules of logic they could not have happened otherwise'.</p>
            <p> Rau's judgement is often jaded by his transparent hostility toward 
              religion and priests. Although this antagonism reaches an alarming 
              crescendo at the end of his work, it permeates the body of the text. 
              Thus Rau is able to fire off a gratuitous salvo even while discussing 
              the apparently innocuous topic of the ancient Indian plough:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The plow (<i>langala, sira</i>) is called (in the <i>Jaiminiya 
                Brahmana </i>JB 2,84) <i>vakram daru, </i>that is, "crooked wood", 
                in which the material, according to <i>SB</i> 7,2,2,3 comes from 
                the <i>udambara</i> tree and was apparently provided with a metallic 
                edge. This last information is doubtful. Even less credible seems 
                the harnessing with six, eight, twelve and even twenty-four draft 
                oxen. V.M. Apte wants to draw the conclusion from this information 
                that the plows must have been very heavy. I prefer to deduce from 
                this that the priests were greedy. The above mentioned animals, 
                according to <i>SB</i> 7,2,2,21, had to be donated to the <i>adhuvary</i> 
                (priest); the more the better!' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>At times Rau forces a highly improbable definition on key Sanskrit 
              terms in order to extract an economic, rather than an ideological, 
              cause for the way things 'must have been'. His motive, of course, 
              is to show that mere greed, rather than any serious metaphysical 
              principle, was the motive of ancient Indian behaviour. A clear case 
              in point is Rau's decision to translate the dichotomous terms <i>sreyas-papiyas 
              </i>as 'rich man and poor man'.</p>
            <p> We shall briefly lay out Rau's line of reasoning. Since the Sanskrit 
              word <i>sreyas</i> is derived from the word <i>sri, </i>which means, 
              among many other things, riches, therefore <i>sreyas</i> (literally 
              'very <i>sri</i>') indicates a very rich man. Thus Rau states: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><i>Sreyas</i> is a person who possesses, as compared to others, 
                the quality of <i>sri</i> to a greater extent. Indeed <i>sri</i> 
                means 'opulence, reputation based on possession'. To have many 
                wives is a form of <i>sri.</i>'The status of a house-lord signifies 
                <i>sri.</i>' <i>SB</i> 5,3,3,3; 5.4.3.15: 'When a man reaches 
                <i>sri, </i>then one plays the lute for him.' <i>SB</i> 13,1,5,1: 
                Only rich men can marry several wives or pay for a lute player.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Towards such a <i>sreyas,</i> the poorer man, <i>papiyas, </i>was 
              obligated with politeness, readiness to serve and taxes.' </p>
            <p>We may also note that the Sanskrit word <i>papiyas, </i>which Rau 
              translates as 'a poor man', is derived from the term <i>papa, </i>which 
              as an adjective means 'bad, vicious, wicked, evil, wretched, vile, 
              low' etc. The word <i>papiyas, </i>analogous to <i>sreyas, </i>means 
              'very <i>papa</i>'.</p>
            <p> We may observe the following:</p>
            <p>(1) Rau does not define the term <i>sreyas</i> directly, but rather 
              he reasons that since <i>sreyas</i> is the comparative form of <i>sri, 
              </i>he can simply cite from the text some uses of the latter word, 
              <i>sri.</i></p>
            <p>(2) Even in doing so, he only cites examples of <i>sri</i> from 
              a single text, the <i>Sata-partha-brahmana, </i>a comparatively 
              late text.</p>
            <p>(3) It is well-known that traditionally both <i>sri</i> and <i>sreyas</i> 
              have a wide range of meanings that go beyond mere economic affluence. 
              Indeed according to the much beleaguered <i>Monier-Williams Dictionary</i>, 
              <i>sri</i> first means 'light, lustre, radiance, splendour, glory, 
              beauty, grace, loveliness'. This sense of the word is found even 
              in the <i>Rig-veda. </i>Then come the notions of 'prosperity, welfare, 
              good fortune, success, auspicious, wealth, treasure, riches, high 
              rank, power, might, majesty, royal dignity', etc.</p>
            <p>(4) A cursory dictionary check of the comparative word <i>sreyas</i> 
              does not take us closer to Rau's definition, but rather farther 
              away from it. <i>Sreyas</i> first means 'more splendid or beautiful, 
              more excellent or distinguished, superior, preferable, better', 
              etc., from the <i>Rig-veda </i>on. The word also means 'propitious, 
              well disposed to, auspicious, fortunate, conducive to welfare or 
              prosperity' etc. Curiously enough, nowhere do we find a strong sense 
              of 'the richer man' or 'the one with more money'.</p>
            <p>(5) As noted above, if we examine the sense of <i>papa, </i>and 
              of <i>papiyas, </i>we once again stray from the predominantly economic 
              tilt of Prof. Rau and enter more into a religious or ethical domain 
              of meaning.</p>
            <p>Thus Rau distorts the simple meaning of Sanskrit words in order 
              to establish what appears to be a type of Marxist analysis that 
              must have seemed more plausible in the 1950s when Rau did his work 
              than it would today.</p>
            <p> Since Rau's next topic, after defining <i>sreyas</i> and <i>papiyas</i> 
              in strictly economic terms, is that the <i>papiyas</i> had to offer 
              respect and service to the <i>sreyas, </i>we have here a neat and 
              ready-made economic explanation of status relationships in ancient 
              India. If, on the other hand, we admit for both <i>sreyas</i> and 
              <i>papiyas</i> their much wider range of actual meanings, then we 
              are plunged into the very situation that Rau so diligently seeks 
              to avoid: that of explaining society, culture and government in 
              ancient India in terms of ideology and religious beliefs about the 
              hierarchy of being.</p>
            <p> Rau seems to consistently take the worst-case scenario as the 
              perpetual state of affairs in ancient India. He wants to show that 
              early Indians lived in a primitive state of savagery in which all 
              were pitted against all in a relentless struggle for material goods. 
              Thus we find this statement and quotation:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The principle of the power of the strongest also governed the 
                relations between the sons ... as soon as the fight for the possessions 
                of the father was ended, another fight began for the possessions 
                of the sons; and who would be the winner was not always predictable. 
                After all the oldest did not always have to be the strongest.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> "He among the sons who presses for the richest inheritance (in 
              the fight among the brothers) is thought by the people to be the 
              winner here." <i>Pancavisma Brahmana,</i> 16,4,4.' </p>
            <p>Although Rau admits in his introduction that we are dealing with 
              a long and uncertain time span, and with a comely array of texts 
              covering different periods (and for that matter, geographic areas), 
              a single quote suffices to characterise the historical period represented 
              by the <i>Brahmana</i> literature, if the cited text indicates a 
              suitably primitive state of society. Thus there were no cases of 
              sons who related to one another on principles any more noble than 
              that of greed. There were no peaceful families, nor was there spiritual 
              self-sacrifice.</p>
            <p> Rau's conviction that all religious stories of gods are but projections 
              of earthly activities, leads him to conclude that in ancient India 
              hosts could, at their sweet pleasure, sacrifice their guests to 
              gods. ' ... the host had full control over the guest. He could thus 
              also use him as a sacrificial animal, as Manu did (advised by Indra) 
              in the legend in the two quotes mentioned above. (<i>Maitrayani 
              Samhita</i> 4,8,1 [4,107,12] and <i>KS</i> 30,1 [2,182,30]) .</p>
            <p> Rau does not hesitate to reject the claims of the <i>Brahmana</i> 
              texts if, in his judgement, they are exaggerated or simply not plausible, 
              as in the case of the large ox teams mentioned above. But he does 
              not hesitate to accept as factual apparent indications of savagery, 
              and indeed he tends to magnify them and to claim for them an all-pervading 
              validity at all times and places in ancient Indian history, even 
              when such claims are made for gods and not human beings, or when 
              the claims appear in but a single text, or in even in a single sentence.</p>
            <p> Thus the distinction between historical fact and fancy rests on 
              Rau's vision of the fundamental, material forces of history. Rau 
              exhibits this selective methodology, as well as his relentless animus 
              toward the <i>brahmanas, </i>in a curious bit of reasoning:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>It is almost impossible to correctly assert the position of the 
                <i>brahmana</i> in the political life of ancient India, because 
                our sources, coming from priests on this point, do not describe 
                the facts, but depict the world as it should be according to the 
                view of the authors.</p>
              <p> When for example the spiritual order is almost always described 
                as the first, the <i>brahmanas </i>as the crown of creation, and 
                all other people appear to be merely their fearful and thereof 
                obedient servants, then this doesn't say much about the real circumstances, 
                as long as independent witnesses from other sources are not added.</p>
              <p> Moreover the text themselves contradict their exorbitant remarks 
                with occasional and unintentional remarks (in which the kings 
                or other rulers are portrayed as being superior).'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I find it amazing here that Rau characterised the balancing statements 
              of the texts as 'unintentional', as if the <i>brahmanas, </i>being 
              occasionally careless and loose-tongued, failed at times in their 
              normal attempt to conceal the truth about their real, and subordinate, 
              position vis-à-vis the political rulers.</p>
            <p> Yet if we assume, as Rau does, that <i>brahmana</i> priests were 
              greedy magicians obsessed with self-aggrandisement and self-promotion, 
              then we may also assume that they would invariably attempt to portray 
              themselves as supreme authorities in the state, and so occasional 
              admissions of the power of kings over <i>brahmanas</i> could be 
              interpreted as 'unintentional'.</p>
            <p> In a curious counter-point, Rau himself reveals that 'Above all, 
              belonging to the priestly class was at first only based on knowledge'; 
              <i>MS</i> 4,8,1 (4,107,9) and <i>KS</i> 30,1 (2,182,6) teach an 
              old saying:</p>
            <p align="center"><i>kim brahmanasya pitaram kim u prchasi mataram<br>
              </i><i>srutam ced asmin vedyam sa pita sa pitamahah</i></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>What do you ask about the mother or father of a <i>brahmana</i>? 
                When he has knowledge about what is worth knowing, then that is 
                his father, that is his grandfather.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Astonishingly, Rau uses this quote only to reinforce a technical 
              argument involving a point of grammar. However, if initially membership 
              in the <i>brahmana</i> class was based on wisdom or knowledge, then 
              in what sense can we say that the Vedic society was 'evolving', 
              when this sensible qualification degenerated into a selfish birthright?</p>
            <p> Further, if originally <i>brahmanas</i> were known by their qualification 
              of learning, or even wisdom, then it is plausible that at a time 
              when those qualifications were taken seriously there would have 
              been a legitimate class of learned men holding the prestigious posts 
              of <i>brahmanas. </i>Since this is a real possibility, why should 
              we constantly claim, as Rau does, that the actions and statements 
              of <i>brahmanas, </i>even in early <i>Brahmana</i> texts, can invariably 
              be best explained in terms of greed for power and money?</p>
            <p> Moving on to another topic, Rau tells us that although the Aryans 
              ate meat, including that of the cow, there is a clear stigma against 
              cow-killers:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Cow meat was still considered a valued food in the <i>Brahmana</i> 
                period. In the list of sacrificial men, on the other hand, the 
                butcher as cattle dismantler and cow killer is already considered 
                a person worthy of contempt, as well as anyone who begs meat from 
                him.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="center"><i>mrtyave go-vyacham antakaya go-ghatam<br>
              </i><i>ksudhe yo gam vikrntantam bhiksamana auptisthat.</i></p>

            <blockquote>

                from a cow dismantler. (<i>Taittiriya Brahmana </i>3,4,16). </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rau does not explain this dichotomy.</p>
            <p> We shall end this brief essay with a few comments on methodology 
              and 'rules of the game'. It is our contention that despite his valuable 
              and diligent scholarship, Prof. Rau's views on early India are coloured 
              by a persistent, non-scholarly tendency to preach against Vedic 
              religion. Thus he relies on reductionistic claims for which there 
              is no conceivable empirical demonstration, and for which there is 
              nothing remotely resembling logical necessity. </p>
            <p> A few statements from Rau should help to demonstrate the strident 
              and adamantine way in which he denied the religious claims of the 
              texts he claims to explain: ' ... the power of the priest was not 
              a real one, only an imagined one. One would think that the complete 
              uselessness of such magical manipulations should all too soon have 
              shown its true face in praxis and put an end to these imaginations.' 
              'The gods are everywhere made in the image of men . '</p>
            <p> We may note here that mere resemblance between gods and men proves 
              nothing since one could just as easily claim, as the <i>Bible</i> 
              does, that men are made in the image of God, or of the gods. The 
              resemblance then 'proves' the opposite point. If one argues, along 
              with Xenophanes, that people seem to depict their gods with features 
              similar to their own, and that all of these various views of the 
              divinity cannot be simultaneously accurate, the following can be 
              said in reply: 'due to conditioned, individual perception, people 
              tend to see many real, objective items in various ways. For example, 
              various artists may depict the same mountain in a variety of styles, 
              or even colours, but the mountain is one.'</p>
            <p> Similarly different perceptions of the divinity may simply prove 
              that individual perception varies, not that the object of differing 
              perceptions does not exist. In fact, although philosophers argue 
              that it proves nothing to say that billions of people through history 
              have claimed some sort of awareness of a divine reality, these same 
              philosophers do not hesitate to claim that we are justified in believing 
              in an objective physical world since so many people believe it to 
              be there. But this is not the place for an extended discussion of 
              meta-epistemology. Suffice it to say that Rau is dreaming if he 
              thinks that he is being 'rational' or 'scholarly when he simply 
              declares that 'The gods are everywhere made in the image of man.' 
            </p>
            <p> But there are further declarations to consider: 'Monarch and the 
              post of king were not gifts of the Godhead, or self-evident rights 
              of a half-godly hero, but rather were transmitted out of utilitarian 
              reasons from equals to one in their midst.'</p>
            <p> Interestingly, the claim of divine right of kingship, and the 
              power of kingship to satisfy a utilitarian need, are in no way mutually 
              exclusive. One would rather expect an intelligent and well-meaning 
              deity to ordain the useful and proscribe the harmful. Thus there 
              is no compulsion to choose between a religious and a utilitarian 
              origin for kingship. It is simply that Prof. Rau is busily engaged 
              in religion-bashing in the name of Indology. 'A few details can 
              be gained from <i>Sa / KausUp </i>about the layout of the residence. 
              Here the voyage of a liberated person to <i>Brahman's</i> palace 
              is described, and we certainly do not go wrong in the assumption 
              that the conditions in heaven are being sketched from worldly examples.'</p>
            <p> A few words are in order here. If, say, in the field of biology, 
              one affirms or denies the claim of a biologist, then one thereby 
              claims to have a knowledge of biology. Similarly to affirm or deny 
              the claim of a historian is to claim knowledge of history, and one's 
              right, thereby, to evaluate historical assertions. Exactly in the 
              same way, to affirm or deny religious claims is to claim for oneself 
              a knowledge of religious matters, and it matters not at all whether 
              one is affirming or denying a religious claim.</p>
            <p> Thus the sheer volume of Prof. Rau's declarations on religious 
              matters, along with his unflinching faith in his unproved (and indeed 
              unprovable) insights, adds up to a clear, unmistakable claim on 
              his part to a privileged understanding of religious truths. Surely 
              Prof. Rau has done a significant service to all who would seriously 
              study Vedic texts by patiently amassing from the <i>Brahmana</i> 
              literature hundreds of important quotations, and then arranging 
              them in a preliminary order. It is not out of ingratitude that we 
              point out his bias against Vedic religion, but rather because such 
              an animus cannot help but influence the outcome of his thinking. 
              So it is relevant to scholarship itself that we notice these things.</p>
            <p> We need the same rules for all Indologists. If purely religious 
              claims can be fairly denied within the boundaries of objective material 
              scholarship, then religious claims can certainly, in principle, 
              be fairly affirmed within the same epistemological, procedural and 
              methodological ground rules. For as that old proverb teaches: 'What's 
              good for the goose is good for the gander'.</p>
