              Gallagher, S.J</a></p>
<p><i>Michael-Paul Gallagher offers a Christian perspective of the 'practical 
  skill of sifting genuine from deceptive in spiritual experiences'. Although 
  his message is specifically designed as a response to NRMs, it is also useful 
  for an ISKCON audience for the insight and counsel it offers on the subject 
  of spiritual discernment.</i></p>
<p>Although I find myself on a panel entitled 'Reactions from the Churches', and 
  although I am a member of the staff of the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with 
  Non-Believers in the Vatican, this presentation will not try to summarise Roman 
  Catholic responses to the NRMs. This has already been done in such documents 
  as the 1986 statement on <i>Sects or New Religious Movements</i> prepared by 
  four bodies within the Vatican<a
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [i] </a>, in the discussions of the Special 
  Consistory of Cardinals held in 1991<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> 
  [ii]</a> and in such academic studies as the article published by John Saliba 
  last year, entitled <i>Vatican Response to the New Religious Movements</i>.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> 
  [iii] </a> Of course the Catholic Church continues to be intensely concerned 
  about this whole field, and there have been many local initiatives and reflections. 
  However, for my contribution here, I propose a more restricted topic and one 
  that, though often mentioned as relevant in this field, is seldom expanded on 
  - the theme of discernment and its applications.</p>
<p> By way of introduction, the relevance of this ancient skill is quite simply 
  because a central crisis in contemporary culture today lies in the area of the 
  spiritual. Our primary focus is Europe, and more particularly the new situation 
  emerging from the demise of Communist systems and from developments within the 
  European Community. This background does not need sketching in any detail. Suffice 
  it to say that for different reasons the two continuing blocs of Europe, now 
  divided more in terms of economics and culture, find themselves in situations 
  of spiritual vulnerability. In the West, post-modernist culture involves a renewed 
  interest in non-materialist searching by many people. In the post-Communist 
  countries a parallel, but different, pattern of religious exploration is taking 
  place. In brief, there is a double religious vulnerability in the previously 
  divided Europe: for various reasons due to different situations this continent's 
  inheritance of Christian belonging finds itself facing new pressures and challenges. 
  My central thesis here is that unless discernment is known and practised, the 
  danger is that in such a period of spiritual-cultural confusion, people can 
  fall into accepting short-term answers to deep human needs. Indeed, these short-term 
  securities can prove humanly destructive in the long-term - and we have tragic 
  evidence of that in recent episodes.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Discernment - <span class="maintextsubhead">a</span> first description</p>
<p>What exactly is discernment? I want to comment on it first in theory and then 
  in practice, making some reference to the Christian scriptures and also to the 
  Ignatian tradition of spirituality.</p>
<p> In medieval philosophy the virtue of prudence involves the exercise of 
  'discretion' - not in its modern English definition, but rather a capacity to 
  examine situations in order to reach a good decision. In this line, discernment 
  is a spiritual development of 'discretion'.<a href="#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title=""> [iv] </a> It involves a process of making choices in 
  the light of faith, which pays special attention to 'the movement of the Spirit 
  within a person's experience and within the signs of the times'. In more contemporary 
  language, discernment specialises in unmasking illusion and in offering skills 
  for a deeper wisdom in decision-making. Even in this definition, one sees the 
  essentially double nature of discernment: one needs to recognise and remove 
  obstacles to making a genuine choice, in order to then move towards a positive 
  seeking of what is ultimately God's will. In this way it is a practical skill 
  for sifting genuine from deceptive in spiritual experiences. It offers long-tested 
  criteria for judging how a person or community can truly claim to be guided 
  by God's Spirit. In tune with many of today's sensitivities, it values interiority 
  but also insists on examining the direction of inner experiences, seeking to 
  recognise roots in terms of fruits, origins of desires and choices in terms 
  of existential orientations and conversions. To use a metaphor, discernment 
  involves a scissors movement, a convergence of lights from above and from below. 
  In the Christian understanding, it seeks to unite the Revelation of God in Christ 
  with the here-and-now options of one's life and history.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> 
  [v] </a> At its core it brings to bear the revelation of God with the actualities 
  of human situations and decisions.</p>
<p> In short, discernment is an ancient practice of reading the signs of the 
  Spirit in human experience, of seeking the call of God in one's human freedom 
  and decisions. This method of weighing of experience offers, I would argue, 
  precisely the practical or prudential wisdom that many people need in today's 
  Europe: negativity in order to see through the deceptions on offer in the spiritual 
  supermarket, and positivity in order to undertake a potentially more fruitful 
  journey towards mature religious faith.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">The Christian scriptures on discernment</p>
<p>From the point of view of the Christian Scriptures, let me briefly offer a 
  few pieces of essential scaffolding concerning spiritual discernment; in other 
  words some references, definitions and general perspectives on its nature and 
  process. The phrase 'discernment of spirits' is used in two rather different 
  contexts in the New Testament. St. Paul, writing to the Corinthians about diversity 
  of gifts, uses the word <i>diakrisis</i> and refers to a special charisma not 
  given to everyone (1 Cor. 12.10) but at the service of the community. In St. 
  John's first letter the term used is <i>dokimasia,</i> and appears to be a gift 
  to everyone (1 Jn 4.1) in order to recognise those spirits that can be trusted 
  as coming from God.</p>
<p> Apart from these two basic texts, several other expressions of St. Paul 
  use the Joharmine word <i>dokimazein</i>, for instance in 'Romans' where he 
  speaks of countering the prevailing culture with the ability to 'test' what 
  is God's will, what is the 'perfect thing to do' (Rom. 12.2). Obviously one 
  should also mention the various promises of the Paraclete in the last discourse 
  of St. John's gospel where Jesus describes one of the functions as showing what 
  is wrong and what is right (Jn. 16. 8).</p>
<p> What is striking in these and other texts of the New Testament, is an underlying 
  assumption of a context of potential deception, and hence the discernment in 
  question is a double operation - a matter of seeing through illusion and of 
  making a godly choice, often in the face of temptation to be taken in by falsity. 
  Positively, it is a matter of experiencing the call of God within one's human 
  freedom.</p>
<p> From several instances in the Pauline corpus, it is also clear that discernment 
  in its full sense is not for beginners in spiritual life. It presumes that a 
  person has undergone conversion and is therefore able to 'deepen their perception 
  in order to recognise what is best' (Phil 1. 9). It is a skill for those who 
  were once 'in darkness' but are now 'light in the Lord' and hence able both 
  to see 'empty arguments' for what they are and 'discover what the Lord wants' 
  (Eph. 5. 6-9). In short, discernment presupposes a 'spiritual person' who is 
  'able to judge the value of everything', and Paul contrasts this level of maturity 
  with those who are still 'sensual . infants fed with milk' (1 Cor. 2.16-3.2). 
  Using exactly the same metaphor, the author of 'Hebrews' offers yet another 
  summary of discernment: 'solid food is for the mature, those with minds formed 
  through practice to distinguish between good and bad' (Heb. 5.14).</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Ignatius of Loyola</p>
<p>Moving on a millennium and a half from the period of the New Testament, I want 
  to pause on the contribution of St. Ignatius of Loyola as a key figure in the 
  development of spiritual discernment as both a theory and more importantly, 
  as a practical discipline. This does not imply that the preceding centuries 
  were barren in terms of developments; the leap in time is due simply to lack 
  of space here, and to the seemingly more crucial relevance of Ignatius of Loyola.<a href="#_edn9"
name="_ednref9" title=""> [vi] </a></p>
<p> It is significant that Ignatius belongs to the age of early modernity, 
  when a new sense of the individual was appearing and hence a new capacity for 
  a spiritual hermeneutics of self-experience (as we might say in today's terminology). 
  In his <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>,<i> </i>Loyola offers new foundations and 
  a major breakthrough in the long tradition of discernment, and one that is universally 
  recognised as still central for spirituality. Here I want to summarise only 
  those aspects of the Ignatian understanding that are relevant to the modern 
  NRM problem. In this respect a crucial and simple insight is developed from 
  St. Paul's remark that Satan can go 'disguised as an angel of light' (2 Cor. 
  11:14). Ignatius sees consolation as coming from God, marked by an increase 
  in love and leading to potentially good decisions, whereas desolation arises 
  from the bad spirit, marked by disturbance and restlessness, and leading to 
  'continual deceptions'.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> [vii] </a> 
  A golden rule is never to change a commitment when in desolation, because 'in 
  time of desolation . we can never find the way to a right decision'.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> 
  [viii] </a> With regard to consolation, things are a little more complicated 
  than might at first appear: consolation is not infallible; it can be deceptive, 
  like the 'disguised angel of light'.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""> [ix] </a> In terms of initial disposition for discernment, 
  a person must be inwardly free. In terms of the state within which a decision 
  is made, a person must be in consolation. But both freedom and consolation are 
  vulnerable. They can seem to be genuine, but may not be so in reality.</p>
<p> With this as a hinge, Ignatius proposes a much more sophisticated attention 
  to the process of one's spiritual movements. He urges one to pay attention not 
  only to the moods of consolation but to their overall orientation. To use the 
  test of time and note where everything is leading. Examine 'the beginning and 
  middle and end of the course of thoughts and experiences'.<a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[x] </a><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'> </span></sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>If all the fruits are good and lasting, this offers the 
  best available confirmation that the roots are in God. But if at some stage, 
  an element of the less good creeps in, beware. In Ignatius' words, this process 
  of subtle deception will show itself in disquiet, 'destroying the peace, tranquillity 
  and quiet' which marked the initial experience.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"
title="">[xi] </a> In the light of the NRMs, we could give as a typical example 
  of such danger signals the period following early euphoria, where some closing 
  of the heart, some opting for rigidity, some inclination not to listen to the 
  advice of friends, an impulsiveness, a separation from previous roots (for instance 
  in family or church), a fundamentalism, an inability to dialogue, indeed an 
  inability to discern, are felt. The loss of a capacity for genuine discernment 
  is one of the most characteristic and dangerous by-products of some of the NRMs 
  in practice. Often it goes hand in hand with a shrinking of the field of communication 
  to those in the inner circle. Once again, a famous metaphor of Ignatius seems 
  relevant: at one stage he compares the process of spiritual deception to a false 
  lover who wants his strategies kept secret; however, once unmasked through speaking 
  freely with 'a spiritual person who understands', the danger can disappear.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"
title="">[xii] </a></span></p>
            <span
style='font-size:8.0pt'> 
            <p> From his own early and rather innocent adventures in spirituality, 
              Ignatius knew that a spiritual journey can be fraught with deceptions. 
              He was acutely aware of how temptations in this field usually come 
              under the appearance of good. This is precisely the Achilles heel 
              of many NRMs - that they offer short-term good which in time reveals 
              itself as long-term destructiveness. In the light of both scripture 
              and the Ignatian tradition, what advice can be given? I would like 
              to present first an theoretical example of a potential candidate 
              for one of the NRMs, and thus suggest ways in which discernment 
              can be applied in practice.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">A case history</p>
            <p>Several months ago a twenty-one year old Italian student - let 
              us call him Cosimo - spoke to me about his personal situation. Some 
              weeks before, he had suffered a sudden break-up of a relationship 
              with a girlfriend - a decision forced on them by her family. He 
              is a first-year student of mathematics, who had previously studied 
              engineering and then abandoned it. He told me that he now wanted 
              to drop mathematics and take up philosophy or theology with the 
              idea of becoming a monk. He explained that while trying to study 
              mathematics, he experienced intense desire for meditation and prayer 
              and that surely this was a genuine sign from God that he should 
              follow. Most of us would share the doubts I immediately expressed 
              about his decision to change studies yet again, over the ultimate 
              genuineness of the desire for prayer. I say 'ultimate' because in 
              the immediate moment it could well be a good inclination; it is 
              within the whole context that it becomes more questionable. Even 
              to raise that question is to begin a process of discernment, since 
              at its simplest, discernment is the skill of recognising roots in 
              terms of fruits.</p>
            <p> The problem was not only to identify the weak points in his decisional 
              logic but more delicately how to communicate this to him in a way 
              that would not cause alienation. I drew fairly directly on the rules 
              for discernment found in the <i>Spiritual Exercises </i>of Ignatius 
              of Loyola, and in particular on his advice to examine carefully 
              the beginning, middle and end of the process of decision-making. 
              In Cosimo's case, the middle seemed genuine enough but the beginning 
              and end were shadowed by serious doubts. By the 'middle', I mean 
              the actual desire for a fuller spiritual life and even the envisaging 
              of a religious vocation. Normally this in itself is good, generous, 
              in harmony with the gospel. But it would be too innocent to take 
              it in itself and not to hear the pressures of non-normality that 
              make this desire suspect: indeed that is the dangerous innocence 
              of many of those attracted to the NRMs.</p>
            <p> However, let us return to the more obvious signals of disorder 
              - in what Ignatius might call the beginning and the end. Clearly 
              this whole movement in Cosimo's life has its roots in the desolation 
              of the break-up with his girlfriend. As regards the end, there is 
              the questionable impulsiveness of wanting to drop his present studies 
              (indeed changing for the second time within a year). Is he so sure 
              of his spiritual longings? Could not even the desire to pray be 
              a form of escape from academic duties? Gradually, as one sifts through 
              his experiences, one realises the potential for blind self-deception. 
              By 'blind' I mean that on his own, Cosimo is unlikely to raise these 
              questions or face these doubts. Using the Ignatian advice about 
              times of desolation - never to change a decision previously made 
              with the strength of consolation - one sees the probable seeds of 
              unwisdom in Cosimo's plan to abandon mathematics and to opt for 
              a religious journey in this way and at this time.</p>
            <p> I have described this individual case because it can serve as 
              a parable of the dubious attractions of the NRMs in modern European 
              culture unless these skills of discernment are learned and communicated. 
              Parallel to the break-up in the background for Cosimo, there is 
              the sense of fragmentation of culture surrounding many young people 
              today. We speak of a fatherless society or a 'death of memory' - 
              with the result that many individuals are left without roots. Spiritual 
              desires become more dangerous when the person lacks an anchor in 
              community, memory or tradition, and the support of family or religion. 
              Frequently, there is also a disenchantment with so-called normal 
              life and its commitments. Add to this the fact that many people 
              live in states of unrecognised desolation, even in prisons of cultural 
              desolation. Against this background it can be dangerous when they 
              choose to follow an intense but somewhat impulsive desire for spiritual 
              commitment, something that in itself seems good. In such situations 
              therefore, practical discernment skills are crucial in order to 
              unmask potential self-deceptions.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Criteria for Christian choices</p>
            <p>Standing back from the example given, what are some of the criteria 
              of a good and Christian decisions in the light of discernment? From 
              St. Paul one may select three essential points: the outcome should 
              build up the community of the church (cf. 1 Cor 14:4); at its core 
              there should be a recognition of Jesus as Lord (cf. 1 Cor. 12:3); 
              genuine fruits will be marked by love, joy, peace and other such 
              unfakeable qualities of spirit and of everyday living (cf. Gal. 
              5:22).<a href="#_edn16"
name="_ednref16" title="">[xiii] </a> There are other criteria to be culled from 
              St. Paul, such as the capacity to endure persecution or to live 
              in tune with the Cross of Christ, but these three seem most relevant 
              in the contemporary situation. The danger of some NRMs is to be 
              sectarian and separatist, and hence break with the larger Church, 
              to move away from the fullness of faith in Christ as Lord into some 
              distorted view, and in the long term to narrow into a ghetto of 
              righteousness that can lack essentials of compassion and peace.</p>
            <p> In this regard, and with an eye to the New Age movement, a recent 
              publication from the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers 
              listed various questions as 'tools for discernment':</p>
            </span>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>Is this leading to compassion, gentleness and self-giving 
                or to self-concern and even to pride? ... is this experience leading 
                to a stronger sense of Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour or else 
                is it causing a certain vagueness about God? With regard to prayer, 
                is it rooted in a sense of reverence for God, and in a relationship 
                of friendship with Christ, or is it content with ways of meditation 
                that remain with a world of self-silence? ... Have these approaches 
                any place for a personal Saviour, or do they tend to self-pedal 
                the reality of sin and evil?<a

            <p>The main thesis of this paper has been that the practical wisdom 
              and self-questioning at the heart of discernment can be of considerable 
              relevance in ministry to those in danger from the more dubious NRMs. 
              At the risk of repetition, I list the 'lights' as follows: </p>
            <p>1.  'Good decisions can only come from the true self; bad decisions 
              spring from the pressures and panics of the false self. Therefore, 
              never make a decision when "down".'<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xv] 
              </a> </p>
            <p>2. Be aware that not every experience of peace or spiritual freedom 
              is genuine. Does it last? What fruits does it bear long-term? Where 
              is this leading? </p>
            <p>3. Being afraid to explore such questions about self-deception 
              with a friend or counsellor outside your immediate circle is a sure 
              sign of danger and potential deception.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>It is clear that most of what has been argued here is of more relevance 
              to those who might work with candidates for NRMs than for those 
              people themselves. If some level of self-awareness and inner freedom 
              is a precondition for spiritual discernment, then it is precisely 
              that requirement that is often dangerously lacking in the potential 
              members of many NRMs. If a further level of purification and conversion 
              to the values of the gospel is a precondition for specifically Christian 
              discernment, then even more so this plane remains beyond the horizon 
              of many of the young attracted to the NRMs. If they had attained 
              such a maturity, they would not be attracted to deceptive forms 
              of religiousness. Therefore discernment is a demanding skill often 
              out of reach for these potential aspirants. My argument is that 
              it is a vital word of wisdom for anyone who would try to minister 
              or counsel in this area, and also that it can be translated fruitfully, 
              at least

                on the moral virtue of prudence would be worth exploring further 
                in this context. For him, it was an individual skill, involving 
                a practical decision about means to ends, and hence was deliberative 
                rather than contemplative. See Thomas Gillby, 'Prudence', <i>New 
                Catholic</i> <i>Encyclopaedia</i>, Vol. II, New York, 1967, p.
