            <p><i>This article first appeared as a chapter in the 1977 book 'Readings 
              in Vedic Literature: the tradition speaks for itself', which was 
              published for use as a college textbook. This extract is an example 
              of the depth of research and mode of presentation that is necessary 
              if ISKCON wants to effectively communicate with an academic audience. 
              The perspectives and conclusions presented show how Gaudiya Vaishnavism 
              can find its voice and learn to speak for itself in the contemporary 
              world.</i></p>
            <p><i>The first Westerners to investigate the Vedic literatures were 
              the British, in the last half of the eighteenth century. It is best 
              to understand their work in the larger historical context of the 
              British rule of India.</i></p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">A brief history of the British in India</p>
            <p>Early invaders of India included the Persians (600 BC) and the 
              Greeks under Alexander the Great (300 BC). India's first great Hindu 
              empire, the Maurya Empire founded by Candragupta (300 BC), expanded 
              under Emperor Asoka to embrace the whole sub-continent, and it also 
              fostered Buddhism. After Asoka, assorted northern tribes invaded 
              India, until the reign of another Gupta dynasty, which united a 
              section of the country for centuries. In the seventh century the 
              Arab Muslims began conquering India, and various Muslim leaders 
              developed empires up until the Mogul Empire, whose chief ruler was 
              Akbar. During the reign of Akbar's son Jahangir (1605-1627), the 
              British established their first trading station in India. The Portuguese 
              had been the first Europeans to arrive, and they competed with the 
              French and English for commercial control of port cities. Through 
              treaties with local rulers, the trading companies became more powerful 
              than the Mogul Empire. The companies received official monopolies 
              from their governments and held huge armies of mercenaries. By defeating 
              an Indian army at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British East 
              India Company finally gained supremacy. Throughout the eighteenth 
              century, the company made treaties or annexed areas by military 
              campaigns; at last in full control of India, it ceded the country 
              to the British government.</p>
            <p>At first, the British government was careful not to force any change 
              in religion upon the Indian people. This policy had always seemed 
              most judicious for ruling the several hundred million Indian citizens 
              without precipitating rebellion. Thus, under Lord Cornwallis (1786-1793, 
              1805) laissez-faire had dominated the East India Company's attitude 
              toward the Indian way of life. Through the East India Company's 
              regulations of 1793, the governor general had promised to 'preserve 
              the laws of the Shaster and the Koran, and to protect the natives 
              of India in the free exercise of their religion'. However, a year 
              before these regulations went into effect, Charles Grant had written, 
              'The company manifested a laudable zeal for extending, as far as 
              its means went, the knowledge of the Gospel to the pagan tribes 
              among whom its factories were placed'. In 1808, the same author 
              described openings of Christian schools and translations of the 
              Bible into Indian dialects as 'principal efforts made under the 
              patronage of the British government in India, to impart to the natives 
              a knowledge of Christianity'.</p>
            <p>Historian Vincent Smith describes three broad tendencies in Britain's 
              policy at the start of the 1800s. The conservatives were interested 
              in improving the Indian way of life, but recommended extreme caution 
              for fear of violent reaction; they saw no easy overthrow of Indian 
              tradition. The liberals felt the need to introduce Western ideas 
              and values, but they hoped to integrate gradually. The rationalists, 
              led by George Berkeley and David Hume, had a more radical approach. 
              They trusted that reason could abolish all human ignorance. And 
              since the West was the champion of reason, the East could only profit 
              by the acquaintance.</p>
            <p>To most eighteenth-century Englishmen (whether at home or abroad), 
              religion meant Christianity. Naturally, racism played its part also. 
              This attitude of Europeans toward Indians was due to a sense of 
              racial superiority - a cherished conviction which was shared by 
              every Englishman in India, from the highest to the lowest. Thus, 
              upon arriving in India in 1813, the governor general, the Marquis 
              of Hastings wrote, 'The Hindoo appears a being merely limited to 
              mere animal functions, and even in them indifferent . with no higher 
              intellect than a dog.'</p>
            <p>Without governmental sanction or license, the Christian evangelists 
              came to India and proselytised to undermine the 'superstitions of 
              the country'. Alexander Duff (1806-1878) founded Scots College, 
              in Calcutta, which he envisioned as a 'headquarters for a great 
              campaign against Hinduism'. Duff sought to convert the natives by 
              enrolling them in English-run schools and colleges, and he placed 
              emphasis on learning Christianity through the English language. 
              Another leading missionary, a Baptist, William Carey (1761-1834), 
              smuggled himself into India and propagandised against the Vedic 
              culture so zealously that the British government in Bengal curbed 
              him as a political danger. On confiscating a batch of Bengali-language 
              pamphlets produced by Carey, India's Governor General Lord Minto 
              described them as 'scurrilous invective . without arguments of any 
              kind, they were filled with hell fire and still hotter fire, denounced 
              against a whole race of men merely for believing in the religion 
              they were taught by their fathers.' Duff, Carey, and other missionaries 
              gradually gained strength and became more aggressive; finally, they 
              gained permission to conduct their campaigns without governmental 
              license. The missionaries actively opposed the British government's 
              attempt to take a neutral stand toward Indian culture and worked 
              with optimism for the complete conversion of the natives. They did 
              not hesitate to denounce the Vedic literatures as 'absurdities' 
              meant 'for the amusement of children'.</p>
            <p>Historian Arthur D. Innes writes, 'The educators had hardly concealed 
              their expectations that with Western knowledge the sacred fairy 
              tales of the East would be dissolved and the basis of popularly 
              cherished creeds would be swept away.' The suspicion of religious 
              coercion disrupted British-Indian relations and in 1857 helped touch 
              off the Sepoy Rebellion (of Indian mercenaries).</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The first scholars</p>
            <p>Such was the setting in which the first Indologists appeared. These 
              first Vedic scholars did not form a unified political or academic 
              party; they were variously conservative, liberal and radical. Sir 
              William Jones, the first Englishman to master Sanskrit and study 
              the Vedas, drew fire from the eminent British historian James Mill 
              for his 'hypothesis of a high state of Civilisation'. Typically, 
              Mill believed that the people of India never had been advanced and 
              that therefore their claim to a glorious past (which some of the 
              early Indologists supported) was historical fantasy. However, by 
              translating the Vedas for the Western reader and thus evincing the 
              ancient Vedic genius, the scholars increased India's prestige in 
              the West. On the other hand, as Aubrey Menen has said, 'It should 
              be remembered that they (the English of the seventeenth century) 
              were not the almost pagan English of today. Every man was a Christian, 
              and it was a Christian's duty to wash the heathen in the blood of 
              the lamb.' Nonetheless, some of the early scholars rather admired 
              the Vedic culture they were investigating, even though they initially 
              conceived of themselves as bearers of Christian light to the sacred 
              darkness of the heathens.</p>
            <p>Sir William Jones (1746-1794), Charles Wilkins (1749-1836), and 
              Thomas Colebrooke (1765-1837) are considered the fathers of Indology. 
              Jones was educated at Oxford and there began his studies in Oriental 
              and other languages; he is said to have mastered a total of sixteen. 
              In addition, he wrote a Persian grammar, translated various Oriental 
              literatures and practised law. After his appointment as judge of 
              the Supreme Court, Sir William went to Calcutta in 1783. There he 
              founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal and was its president throughout 
              his life. He translated a number of Sanskrit works into English, 
              and his investigations into languages mark him as one of the most 
              brilliant minds of the eighteenth century. Sir William was not prone 
              to invective against another's religion, particularly the Vedic, 
              which he admired. In his view the narratives of the East, like those 
              of Greece and Rome, could enrich both the English tradition and 
              the human mind. Notwithstanding, Sir William's stance was that of 
              'a devout and convinced Christian'. Thus, he described the <i>Bhagavata 
              Purana</i> as 'a motley story', and he speculated that the <i>Bhagavata</i> 
              came from the Christian gospels, which had been brought to India 
              and 'repeated to the Hindus, who ingrafted them on the old fable 
              of Cesava (Kesava, a name for Krsna), the Apollo of Greece'. This 
              theory has since been discredited since records of Krsna worship 
              pre-date Christ by centuries. H. H. Wilson (1786-1860), described 
              as 'the greatest Sanskrit scholar of his time', received his education 
              in London and journeyed to India in the East India Company's medical 
              service. He became secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1811-1833), 
              and medical duties notwithstanding, he published a Sanskrit-English 
              dictionary. He became Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford in 1833, 
              librarian of the India House in 1836 and director of the Royal Asiatic 
              Society in 1837. Titles credited to his name include <i>Vishnu Purana</i>, 
              <i>Lectures on the Religious and</i> <i>Philosophical Systems of 
              the Hindus </i>and <i>Rig Veda</i>, among others. He also contributed 
              to Mill's <i>History of</i> <i>India</i> and edited several other 
              translations of Eastern literatures. In addition, he proposed that 
              Britain restrain herself from forcing the Hindus to give up their 
              religious traditions. Compared to the evangelists, he appears to 
              have been a champion of the preservation of Vedic ideas.</p>
            <p class="maintext">Yet we may be a little startled by his stated 
              motives: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>From the survey which has been submitted to you, you will perceive 
                that the practical religion of the Hindus is by no means a concentrated 
                and compact system, but a heterogeneous compound made up of various 
                and not infrequently incompatible ingredients, and that to a few 
                ancient fragments it has made large and unauthorised additions, 
                most of which are of an exceedingly mischievous and disgraceful 
                nature. It is, however, of little avail yet to attempt to undeceive 
                the multitude; their superstition is based upon ignorance, and 
                until the foundation is taken away, the superstructure, however 
                crazy and rotten, will hold together.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ultimately, Wilson felt that the Christian culture should simply 
              replace the Vedic culture, and he believed that full knowledge of 
              the Indian tradition would help effect that conversion. In his modulated 
              conservatism he seemed to echo the East India Company. Aware that 
              the people of India would not easily give up their tradition, he 
              made this shrewd commentary:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The whole tendency of <i>brahminical</i> education is to enforce 
                dependence upon authority - in the first instance upon the guru, 
                in the next upon the books. A learned <i>brahmana</i> trusts solely 
                to his learning, he never ventures upon independent thought; he 
                appeals to memory; he quotes texts without measure and in unquestioning 
                trust. It will be difficult to persuade him that the <i>Vedas</i> 
                are human and very ordinary writings, that the <i>Puranas</i> 
                are modern and inauthentic, or even that the tantras are not entitled 
                to respect. As long as he opposed authority to reason, and stifles 
                the workings of conviction by the dicta of a reputed sage, little 
                impression can be made upon his understanding. Certain it is, 
                therefore, that he will have recourse to his authorities, and 
                it is therefore important to show that his authorities are worthless.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Wilson also warned that the Vedic adherents were likely to show 
              'tenacious obstinacy' about their 'speculative tenets . particularly 
              those regarding the nature and condition of the soul'. But he was 
              hopeful that by inspired, diligent effort the 'specious' system 
              of Vedic thought would be 'shown to be fallacious and false by the 
              Ithuriel spear of Christian truth'. As the first holder of Oxford's 
              Boden Chair for Sanskrit, H. H. Wilson delivered public lectures 
              to promote his cause. He intended that the lectures 'help candidates 
              for a prize of two hundred pounds . for the best refutation of the 
              Hindu religious system'. Wilson's writings are full of similar passages, 
              including a detailed method for exploiting the native Vedic psychology 
              by use of a counterfeit guru-disciple relationship. Now, in Wilson's 
              case, the charge of bias has become aggravated by charges of invalid 
              scholarship. Recently, Natalie P. R. Sirkin presented documented 
              evidence that betrays Wilson as a plagiarist: his most important 
              publications were collected manuscripts by deceased authors whose 
              works he credited to himself, as well as works completed without 
              research (such as writing an analysis of the <i>Puranas</i> without 
              reading them).</p>
            <p>Another renowned pioneer Indologist was F. Max Muller (1823-1900), 
              born in Dessau and educated in Leipzig. He learned Sanskrit and 
              translated the ancient <i>Hitopadesa</i> before coming to England, 
              in 1846. Commissioned by the East India Company to translate the 
              <i>Rig Veda</i>, he lived in Oxford and wrote many books on mythology 
              and comparative religion. Muller is best known for his series <i>Sacred 
              Books of the East</i>, a fifty-volume work which he devoted himself 
              to editing in 1875.</p>
            <p>In 1876, Muller wrote to a friend, 'India is much riper for Christianity 
              than Rome or Greece were at the time of Saint Paul'. He added that 
              he would not like to go to India as a missionary because that would 
              make him dependent on the government. His preference was: 'I should 
              like to live for ten years quite quietly and learn the language, 
              try to make friends, and then see whether I was fit to take part 
              in a work, by means of which the old mischief of Indian priestcraft 
              could be overthrown and the way opened for the entrance of simple 
              Christian teaching.' Muller regarded Vedic philosophy as 'Aryan 
              legend' and 'myth', and he believed that Aryan civilisations had 
              simply helped bring about the evolution of Christianity: 'History 
              seems to think that the whole human race required gradual education 
              before, in the fullness of time, it could be admitted to the truths 
              of Christianity' adding, 'The ancient religions of the world may 
              have but served to prepare the way of Christ by helping through 
              its very errors.'</p>
            <p>H. H. Wilson's successor in Oxford's Boden Chair was Sir Monier 
              Monier-Williams (1819-1899). Born in Bombay, Monier-Williams attended 
              the East India Company's college and later taught there. After his 
              appointment as a professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, in 1870, he delivered 
              an inaugural lecture entitled <i>The</i> <i>Study of Sanskrit in 
              Relation to Missionary Work in India</i>. Monier-Williams also wrote 
              a book called <i>Hinduism</i> (1894), which was published and distributed 
              by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He is best known 
              to twentieth-century Indology students for his Sanskrit-English 
              Dictionary. In addition, he spent twenty-five years founding an 
              institution at Oxford for disseminating information about Indian 
              literature and culture. He succeeded, and the Indian Institute formally 
              opened in 1896. Monier-Williams disapproved of Muller's evolution-to-Christianity 
              view of the Vedic <i>sastra</i>:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>There can be no doubt of a greater mistake than to force these 
                non-Christian bibles into conformity with some scientific theory 
                of development and then point to the Christian's Holy Bible as 
                the crowning product of religious evolution. So far from this, 
                these non-Christian bibles are all developments in the wrong direction. 
                They all begin with some flashes of true light and end in utter 
                darkness.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Monier-Williams further wrote, </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>It seems to me that our missionaries are already sufficiently 
                convinced of the necessity of studying these works, and of making 
                themselves conversant with the false creeds they have to fight 
                against. How could an army of invaders have any chance of success 
                in an enemy's country without a knowledge of the position and 
                strength of its fortresses, and without knowing how to turn the 
                batteries they may capture against the foe?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another early Indologist was Theodore Goldstucker (1821-1872), 
              born in Konigsberg and educated there and in Bonn, where he studied 
              Sanskrit, philosophy and Oriental languages. After settling in England, 
              in 1850, he received appointment as a professor of Sanskrit at London's 
              University College, a post he held until his death. Goldstucker 
              wrote a number of books on Sanskrit literature and founded the Society 
              for the Publication of Sanskrit Texts. He also participated in a 
              number of writing and research projects concerning India. <i>The 
              Dictionary of Indian Biography</i> describes him as 'an authority 
              on ancient Hindu literature'. Goldstucker regarded the people of 
              India as being burdened by Vedic religion, which had only brought 
              them worldwide 'contempt and ridicule'. Thus, he proposed to re-educate 
              them with European values. Goldstucker wrote, 'The means for combating 
              that enemy is as simple as it is irresistible: a proper instruction 
              of the growing generation in its ancient literature.' In his book 
              <i>Inspired Writings of Hinduism</i>, Goldstucker assailed the validity 
              of Vedic literature. His aim was to demonstrate to the new generation 
              of Vedic followers that he had scholastically annihilated their 
              scripture and that they should show their appreciation by adopting 
              European values and improving their character.</p>
            <p>It is lamentable that this sectarian raison d'etre clouded the 
              early study of Vedic literature. When reading the theories or analyses 
              of these early Indologists, therefore, the student would do well 
              to bear in mind the bias behind the brilliant scholarship.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Their influence on modern scholarship</p>
            <p>College Sanskrit departments no longer award prizes for 'the best 
              refutation of Hinduism'. Indeed, in the current selection of books 
              by Vedic scholars, the authors describe themselves as 'sympathetic 
              outsiders', 'friends of India' and 'admirers of the tradition of 
              tolerance in Indian religion'.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, some of the missionary Indologists' main theses still 
              crop up as time-honoured facts. Simply by being pioneers, Wilson, 
              Monier-Williams, Muller and others have left a lasting impression 
              of how one should study the <i>sastras</i>. 'The foundations for 
              the recovery of India's past were laid by certain eminent classical 
              scholars, including Sir William Jones, James Prinsep, H. T. Colebrooke 
              and H. H. Wilson . the debt owed these men is great.'</p>
            <p>Modern Vedic scholars are hardly missionaries; however, largely 
              from academic habit, they give tacit approval to many of the first 
              Indologists' conclusions. For instance, the early researchers portrayed 
              Vedic literature as a hodgepodge of disharmonious texts. Sir Monier 
              Monier-Williams wrote, ' . after a lifelong study of the religious 
              books of the Hindus, I feel compelled to publicly express my opinion 
              of them. They begin with much promise amid scintillations of truth 
              and light and occasional sublime thoughts from the source of all 
              truth and light, but end in sad corruptions and lamentable impurities.' 
              Like their predecessors, today's scholars discredit the <i>Puranas</i>, 
              although the Vedic <i>acaryas</i> themselves have accepted the <i>Puranas</i> 
              as equal to the other Vedic <i>sastras</i>. One scholar recently 
              commented that Muller attempted to change Hinduism to a 'new and 
              purer form' and failed, but that 'his conception of the history 
              of Hinduism, which presented an antithesis between its Vedic form 
              and the so-called Puranic form . still survives in a modified version'. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition, many of today's scholars still teach that the <i>Vedas</i> 
              are essentially mythological and that the <i>Puranas </i>are not 
              even consonant with the Vedic mythology. In other words, they disavow 
              what the <i>acaryas </i>affirm - namely, that the Vedic literatures 
              form a coherent whole, and that the <i>Puranas</i> are the culmination. 
              But since it is the <i>Puranas</i> that substantiate monotheism, 
              if these are dismissed we ignore part of the Vedic picture of the 
              Absolute Truth.</p>
            <p>As might be expected, many of today's students see Vedic literature 
              as lacking clarity and conclusiveness. More often than not, as one 
              begins his Indological studies, he hears that Vedic authority is 
              dubious, that eternal existence is simply a wish for self-perpetuation 
              and that God and the demigods are ipso-facto myths. Indeed, the 
              compiler of the Vedas, Vyasadeva, often receives no mention. Moriz 
              Winternitz writes that the names of the authors of Vedic literature 
              are unknown to us and that sometimes 'a mythical seer of primitive 
              times is named as author'. </p>
            <p>Yet Vedic evidence confirms Vyasadeva as the literature's actual 
              compiler: 'Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, 
              Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati, wife of Parasara 
              Muni, and he divided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches.. 
            </p>
            <p>Winternitz comments: 'The orthodox . believe the same Vyasa who 
              compiled the <i>Vedas </i>and composed the <i>Mahabharata</i>, who 
              also in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the present age of the world, 
              was the author of the eighteen <i>Puranas</i>. But this Vyasadeva 
              is a form of the exalted God Visnu Himself.' Thus, without further 
              ado, Winternitz rejects the possibility of Vyasadeva's authorship 
              and goes on to discuss other possible authors: since the <i>Puranas</i> 
              present Vyasadeva as an <i>avatara</i>, he obviously could never 
              have existed. In this way, Vedic personalities and statements become 
              suspect, even 'mythological', simply because they are supra-mundane. 
            </p>
            <p>The student of the <i>Vedas</i> should understand plainly that 
              they do describe the supra-mundane, and that to reject their statements 
              on this basis is really self-defeating. One should approach the 
              <i>Vedas</i> with an open mind and let them speak for themselves. 
              Otherwise, they will remain a hodgepodge of 'sad corruptions and 
              lamentable impurities'.</p>
            <p>For the most part, modern scholars continue to minimise the existential 
              and transcendental validity of the <i>Vedas</i>, often without so 
              much as an explanation why empiric knowledge should take precedence 
              over <i>sabda</i>, knowledge from authority. Thus, subtly but surely, 
              the indological scholars of the present day have inherited the pioneers' 
              bias, and though today's bias is not 'evangelist' but 'empiricist', 
              it slants just the same. With all deference to the laudable efforts 
              of the empiricists, we suggest that the student try to take a fresh 
              look at Vedic literature, through the eyes of the Vedas themselves. 
              Momentarily setting aside the legacy of the British Indological 
              pioneers, the new student of Vedic literature will benefit from 
              returning to the primary sources - the original <i>sastras </i>and 
              the commentaries of the <i>acaryas</i>. In this way, without preconceived 
              notions, the student may better appreciate the coherent and many-faceted 
              knowledge that the <i>Vedas</i> offer.</p>
