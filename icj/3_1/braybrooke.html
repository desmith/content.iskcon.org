            <p class="maintextsubhead">Author: Marcus Braybrooke<br>
              Publisher: SCM Press, London, 1992</p>
            <p><span class="maintextsubhead"><i></i></span><i>Pilgrimage of Hope</i> 
              is a mass of facts and names which tells the story of the first 
              hundred years of world interfaith dialogue. The fact that all this 
              dialogue does not seem to have led anywhere in particular, other 
              than to give rise to further dialogue, is clearly not a reason for 
              Marcus Braybrooke to give up hope, as the title suggests.</p>
            <p> One touching example of interfaith hope, the Temple of Understanding, 
              had its beginnings in Connecticut in 1959. It arose out of a dream 
              to build a temple dedicated to the religions of the world, and was 
              erected on an 18-acre site outside Washington purchased for this 
              purpose in 1966. Between 1968 and 1983 the would-be temple managed 
              to organise six 'Spiritual Summits', eventually leading to the Global 
              Spiritual and Parliamentary Forum on Human Survival, in which religious 
              leaders and politicians met in Oxford in 1988 and again in Moscow, 
              with the celebrated presence of Gorbachev, in 1990. The Global Forum 
              has since run out of funds and direction, and the Temple of Understanding 
              has joined forces with Britain's World Congress of Faiths, publishing 
              <i>World Faiths Encounter</i> three times a year. The Washington 
              site remains empty.</p>
            <p> The interfaith story holds few surprises, being full of worthy 
              people doing worthy things. Nevertheless I discovered that some 
              of the most successful and largest interfaith gatherings of recent 
              years have been sponsored and organised by the Unification Church 
              (the Moonies), that the first interfaith meeting, the World Parliament 
              of Faiths held in Chicago in 1893, lasted sixteen days and brought 
              together over seven thousand people, and that the annual budget 
              of the International Asssociation for Religious Freedom rose from 
              $60,000 to $600,000 between 1972 and 1987, apparently by subscription 
              from associated religious groups. </p>
            <p> Since 1893, there have been hundreds of international meetings, 
              laboriously catalogued by Braybrooke. One wonders where all the 
              money comes from for some of these huge gatherings. For example, 
              the Moonie-backed Council for the World's Religions and Global Congress 
              of World's Religions attract large numbers because they are held 
              in exotic places and everyone's air fare and accommodation is paid 
              for by the Unification Church, which demonstrates that there is 
              never a shortage of people for a freeby, and that religious leaders 
              love to speak on a platform. It also raises questions about the 
              funding of interfaith activities in general which Braybrooke fails 
              to address, although he concedes that some interfaith people are 
              uncomfortable with the Moonie money.</p>
            <p> Many see interfaith dialogue as a threat to traditional claims 
              for uniqueness or finality in their own religion. The original World 
              Parliament of Religions was considered by its organisers to mark 
              a new era of Christian triumph. Although Christians were prepared 
              to learn from other faiths, they saw Christ as the fulfilment of 
              all other religions. This approach to interfaith was still evident 
              at the 1975 Assembly of the World Council of Churches which defined 
              interfaith dialogue as 'both a matter of hearing and understanding 
              the faith of others and also of witnessing to the gospel of Jesus 
              Christ', and went on to say that there will never be a time 'when 
              the tension will be resolved between belief in Jesus Christ and 
              unbelief' (all unbelievers take note). Interfaith worship continues 
              to be a real problem area for some, especially Jews and Christians 
              - how do they participate in another's act of worship without compromising 
              their beliefs?</p>
            <p> In awareness of these fears most interfaith organisations consider 
              each religion to be valid and distinct, contributing to the richness 
              of human culture. They do not attempt to bring them into a single 
              world religion. However, many of them, including Braybrooke, do 
              recognise an underlying unity and favour a convergence of religions. 
              As Sir Francis Younghusband, who founded the World Congress of Faiths, 
              said, 'God reveals himself in many ways. To the followers of other 
              religions than our own may have been revealed much that may be of 
              value to us.' WCF sees dialogue as a truth-seeking exercise which 
              may lead to a truth which transcends any one religion.</p>
            <p> Besides the World Congress of Faiths, there are dozens of interfaith 
              organisations with World or International somewhere in their name, 
              such as World Parliament of Religions, World Fellowship of Religions, 
              World Fellowship of Faiths, World Congress of Faiths, World Thanksgiving, 
              World Interfaith Association, World Conference on Religion and Peace, 
              Inter-Religious Fellowship for World Peace, International Religious 
              Foundation, International Association For Religious Freedom, Council 
              for the World's Religions and Global Congress of World's Religions.</p>
            <p> Among these, the World Conference on Religion and Peace and 
              the International Association for Religious Freedom stand out. The 
              IARF had its beginnings at the 1893 World Parliament, which was 
              really a Christian assembly with a few guests of other faiths invited, 
              but where Vivekananda was a big hit. He caused alarm by saying that 
              Hindus accepted all religions as true and openly challenging the 
              assumption of Christian superiority. After all the excitement of 
              the Parliament had died down, its organising body grew into the 
              International Association for Religious Freedom, with the particular 
              support of Unitarian Christians. In recent years the IARF held major 
              congresses in Montreal in 1975, Oxford in 1978, Holland in 1981, 
              Tokyo in 1984, Stamford University in 1987, Hamburg in 1990 and 
              Bangalore in 1993. The 1996 congress will be held in Korea.</p>
            <p> History records that the inaugural meeting of the World Conference 
              on Religion and Peace coincided with the very day of the outbreak 
              of the First World War. The meeting had to be cut short, and as 
              the participants hastily made their way back to their countries, 
              some in real danger, they must have wondered if it had been worth 
              the effort. The cruel contradiction between worthy aims and sad 
              reality is at the heart of the interfaith movement. The WCRP survived 
              the First World War but was not in time to avert World War Two. 
              It finally held its first World Assembly in Japan (where the interfaith 
              money seems to be these days) in 1970. It has since held five more 
              Assemblies and become a significant forum for the meeting of religious 
              and political leaders. Its concerns now extend to human rights, 
              environment, development and religious fundamentalism, with its 
              existing focus on disarmament and building peace.</p>
            <p> What has all this dialogue achieved? Is there any point in 
              good people meeting to make good declarations to each other, such 
              as 'There will be no world peace without peace between religions,' 
              when the bad people just carry on being bad? Or is there truth in 
              the saying that all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good 
              people to do nothing? I leave it to you to decide. Marcus Braybrooke 
              is in no doubt and his effort to chart the ground is clearly a labour 
              of love. For the rest of us, <i>Pilgrimage of Hope</i> will be heavy 
              going but a useful reference work for those who need to know the 
              details. I for one am grateful to Marcus Braybrooke and his interfaith 
              friends for lighting a candle and failing to curse the darkness.</p>
