<p>The conclusions of Dr. James A. Bedford's article, 'The Mass Media and New 
  Religious Movements' confirm the opinions of many ISKCON devotees toward the 
  media. He states, 'It seems to me that the public is right to expect that journalists 
  should be more methodical, discriminating, careful and open-minded than they 
  normally are when it comes to portraying NRMs (New Religious Movements). Their 
  knee-jerk categorisation of the movements as problematic and conflictual is 
  not only prejudiced and lazy but it also feeds directly into public ignorance 
  and a less than even-handed attitude towards the movements on the part of social 
  control agencies ... '      </p>
<p> Over the past two years, in my communications service, I have visited leaders 
  of more than forty temples to discuss and teach communication principles. More 
  often than not, topics such as 'effective media relations' and 'avoiding an 
  adversarial relationship with the media', were met with suspicion. Devotee opinions 
  of the fourth estate were at best indifferent, often adversarial and sometimes 
  outright inimical. Mind-sets - formed, perhaps, after years of 'mistreatment 
  by demoniac reporters' - were fixed.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">What to do?</p>
<p>Discussion of the historically prickly relationship between the media and religion 
  is not limited to ISKCON, nor Dr. Bedford's NRMs. It's been a hot topic for 
  years, at least in America.where several in-depth studies have been commissioned. 
         </p>
<p> For example, the well-known 1980 study, <i>The Media Elite</i>, undertaken 
  by S. Robert Lichter, Stanley Rothman and Linda Lichter, revealed that 86% of 
  the 'media elite' polled by the authors 'seldom' or 'never' attended religious 
  services. This was in sharp contrast to the American public who, on average, 
  attend religious services with greater regularity. Thus, the Rothman study provided 
  evidence that the media was out of synch with the country's strong religious 
  sentiment. In his 1994 report, <i>Religion in Public Discourse: The Role of 
  The Media</i>, Stewart Hoover commented, 'This idea, that the natural inclination 
  of media decision-makers is to be either anti-religious, or at least irreligious, 
  is widely shared.'        </p>
<p> In another study<i>, Bridging the Gap</i>, authors Jimmy Allen and John 
  Dart found a different scenario in the newsrooms. Their 1993 report sampled 
  266 managing editors across the United States. They were careful to include 
  many smaller media organisations not polled under Rothman's definition of the 
  'media elite'. Interestingly, they found a much higher level of interest in 
  religion. Seventy-two percent of their media sample responded that religion 
  was 'important' in their lives, a significantly smaller figure than that of 
  96% received from the American public in response to the same question. Yet 
  it does demonstrate a much greater degree of personal interest in religion than 
  the earlier Rothman and Lichter work had measured.     </p>
<p> It is not possible in this brief paper to provide an in-depth analysis 
  of these studies. However, it is important to note that many media agencies 
  and individuals working in the media, are re-analysing their coverage of, and 
  relation to, religion. Observers have noted progress in the media's appreciation 
  of the importance of religion in society, as well as an enhanced interest in 
  reporting on religi<br>
  on. </p>
<p> With that in mind, let us return to Bedford's article. It is clear that 
  he poses some immediate and serious questions for ISKCON. On the one hand, he 
  reminds us that, 'Journalists function as the principal gatekeepers of public 
  opinion especially on matters with which the person-in-the-street is not normally 
  familiar ... the public is heavily dependent on the mass media for information 
  about unconventional ... religious movements.' Yet he also warns that 'Religion 
  does not fit easily into the dominant worldview of most contemporary broadcasters 
  who are often ill-prepared to deal with religion, being indifferent, or occasionally, 
  actively hostile.'        </p>
<p> This is the dilemma facing ISKCON. Accepting that the relationship between 
  the media and religion, especially NRMs, is, as Hoover calls it 'contentious', 
  the essential question must be: What are we going to do about it? In other words, 
  does Beckford's analysis illustrate a challenge to be addressed or a problem 
  to bemoan and ignore? Should we withdraw from attempts at media relations? Or 
  should we increase, or at least begin, serious communication with the media?</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">A brief case-study</p>
<p>On 28 February 1995, the Srila Prabhupada Puspa Samadhi Memorial was inaugurated 
  in Mayapur, West Bengal, ISKCON's world headquarters. The culmination of many 
  years of international effort, the monument to His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada 
  stands 160 feet tall and boasts an 80 foot diameter dome decoratively shrouded 
  with 36,000 marble tiles. It is a glorious sight to behold, one that fills the 
  hearts of Srila Prabhupada's followers with pride and appreciation.             
</p>
<p> Unknown to 99% of the devotee community, however, is the fact that the 
  celebration came extremely close to becoming a public relations disaster. Mistakes 
  were made that could have severely detracted from our reputation in India and 
  around the world.           In brief, the 'behind-the-scenes' catastrophe unfolded 
  like this. During the afternoon of 27 February, the day before the Inaugural, 
  twenty-seven members of the press, representing agencies and newspapers from 
  Calcutta and across India, arrived at Sri Dhama Mayapura. All of them had responded 
  to a written invitation to 'our grandiose Inaugural Festival'. The invitation 
  stated that the journalists would be provided with a 'luxury bus ride' from 
  Calcutta, fed with 'excellent dinner <i>prasadam</i>' and, most significantly, 
  provided for 'at our guesthouse as our honourable guests ... '           Unfortunately, 
  upon arrival in Mayapur, the reporters quickly discovered that provisions at 
  the 'guesthouse' consisted of a single dormitory room equipped with twenty-seven 
  mattresses laid on the floor, calling for twenty-six men and one woman to sleep 
  together, on the floor, in one room.        </p>
<p> The immediate reaction of the reporters varied from disbelief to disgust. 
  Worse yet, no ISKCON personnel seemed to comprehend the significance of the 
  mistake, nor rectify it, although several meagre attempts were made. At one 
  point, for example, a <i>sannyasi</i> tried to procure cots for the reporters 
  at the registration office, thinking that at least our guests shouldn't be left 
  on the floor. Unfortunately, when the <i>sannyasi </i>was informed that some 
  ISKCON member would have to sign for the cots, taking personal responsibility, 
  he refused to take such a risk. The reporters, whose leaders witnessed his lack 
  of gumption to assist them, became further infuriated.           </p>
<p> Needless to say, the scheduled 7.30 p.m. press conference with ISKCON VIPs, 
  arranged for the benefit of the reporters, was unattended by any of them. In 
  fact, they boycotted it in protest. One of the reporters fumed, 'Just wait and 
  see what kind of articles we write!'             </p>
<p> Sadly, unbelievably, the fiasco continued late into the night. Eventually, 
  two devotees with media experience who were visiting from Bombay, came to hear 
  of the affair. Although they had no local authority, they took personal command 
  of the crisis. By 11.00 p.m., with the sluggish cooperation of the local administration, 
  they had found enough empty rooms to provide decent accommodation for the still 
  angry, now exhausted, guests. With much effort, the two were able to appease 
  the reporters. The next day, after attending a rescheduled Press Conference 
  and the grand opening of the Samadhi, the reporters were on their way back to 
  Calcutta, with decidedly mixed impressions.</p>
<p> The next day, over lunch, two senior Mayapur managers summed up the incident 
  as follows: 'This proves that we just shouldn't invite them (the media). Why 
  should we go to so much trouble to provide for them?' The other responded, 'We 
  don't need to woo the press, they will come running after us ...' </p>
<p> In later conversation, I personally overheard one of the same managers say, 
  'We don't need those people here. They're too much trouble. I don't want them 
  here.' He further consolidated his position by commenting that during the (rescheduled) 
  press conference 'they kept asking questions about (the visiting VIPs) background 
  and their relationship to Krsna Consciousness. They wouldn't just stick to questions 
  about the building, and what we wanted them to ask about ... '</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Is it all the media's fault?</p>
<p>The point of telling this sad story is not to find fault, but to seriously 
  challenge each member of ISKCON to study our behaviour, outlook and ethic. We 
  need to ask ourselves: What can we do from our side to improve the way ISKCON 
  handles, or mishandles, the media? What things must we stop doing that perpetuate 
  our oft maligned reputation?     </p>
<p> For example, Dr. Bedford states, 'The most elementary observation about 
  print and broadcast media's portrayal of NRMs is that the movements' activities 
  are newsworthy only when conflicts are involved.' Devotees are conscious of 
  this pattern and often complain that articles about past problems at New Vrindavan, 
  the ongoing trial of ex-member Kirtanananda Swami, and similar troubles attract 
  media interest, whereas positive events are much less likely to be covered. 
              </p>
<p> It is a well-documented fact that most media coverage focuses on problems. 
  Conflicts, crises and differences of opinion form three major categories of 
  what they consider news! It is also a fact that many organisations - both secular 
  and religious, public and private - complain about the media's negative preoccupation. 
  I've sat through a dozen or more conferences listening to analysis of the media's 
  obsession with negative news. It's my observation that media people themselves 
  are often the most unhappy about their seeming fixation. The point is, we're 
  not alone in our complaint or in the way we're 'handled'. The relevant question 
  remains: How do we intelligently respond to media methodologies, and not just 
  complain about or be victimised by them?</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">More missed opportunities</p>
<p>Last summer I visited a major temple, one of the first to be built by Srila 
  Prabhupada, coming up to Rathayatra. I discovered that not a single media release, 
  photograph, advertisement, notice, flyer or invitation had been sent to any 
  of the large Asian Indian newspapers in that city, although the combined circulation 
  of those papers was over 100,000.           </p>
<p> Three years ago, I visited another city to help with communications for 
  an ongoing court battle. During my short visit several devotees, including leaders, 
  informed me with deep conviction that I was wasting my time, that the media 
  in their city was 'very demoniac'.     </p>
<p> On a later trip to that same city, I made a point of seeking out the religion 
  reporter of the region's most prominent newspaper, a highly respected paper 
  with national influence. The reporter was happy to meet us and spent three hours 
  that afternoon engaging in discourse and offering advice to the temple president 
  and myself. At the end of his visit, he confided in us that in seventeen years 
  of covering religion in that town, our invitation for him to visit the temple 
  and meet ISKCON leadership was the first he'd ever received. The point is worth 
  repeating: <i>in seventeen years, he'd never received an</i> <i>invitation to 
  the Hare Krsna temple</i>. Clearly, much needs to be done.</p>
<p> Understanding the essential role the media plays in impacting public opinion, 
  we must take responsibility to reach out and communicate - to them and through 
  them - the nature of ISKCON and what it has to offer. It remains the responsibility 
  of mature ISKCON managers and leaders to educate themselves as to how the media 
  operates, and to work towards improved understanding and exchange of information. 
              Michael Medved, co-host of the Public Broadcasting System's (PBS) 
  movie review programme <i>Sneak Previews</i>, chief film critic for the <i>New 
  York Post</i> and a devout Jew, recently spoke to the Religion Public Relations 
  Council convention in Los Angeles. He urged religious communicators not to retreat 
  behind sweeping condemnation of the media's flaws, mistakes and biases, but 
  to work harder to utilise the media to express religious viewpoints, events 
  and relevance. He highlighted three places where we can begin.</p>
<p class="maintextsubsubhead"><i>1. Less complaining / more creating</i></p>
<p>ISKCON needs less complaining about the media and its coverage, or lack of 
  it, and more creative, positive ideas and interaction aimed at educating the 
  media about, and interesting them in, the Society. The end result can only be 
  an increase in reporting about us, and a significant improvement in the accuracy 
  of those reports. We need more trained communicators, more materials geared 
  for media consumption and better organised events, as well as less mistakes 
  in our management and activities that attract legitimate public criticism.</p>
<p class="maintextsubsubhead"><i>2.  Less confrontation / more communication</i></p>
<p>Labelling or unnecessarily demonising others, is not only condescending and 
  against our philosophy of compassion, it is also foolish and counterproductive. 
  Most apprehension, and thus most bad reporting about ISKCON, comes from ignorance 
  about us. It is our job to dispel that ignorance through effective communication. 
  Merely attacking others, even if they attack us, is a materialistic response. 
  It is an insufficient response. It ignores the principle of <i>yukta-vairagya</i>, 
  or using the various resources and energies of this material world in the service 
  of God.        </p>
<p> This is not to say that if a media report is blatantly unfair, biased 
  or untrue, we should not react. On the contrary, we must respond quickly, and 
  strongly. As appropriate to the situation, we must utilise the full gambit of 
  effective, professional communication techniques. On rare occasions we may need 
  to respond through the courts or even via legislative initiatives. We cannot 
  simply ignore the problems that confront us, but we must not overreact, either. 
  Nor can we fail to take personal or communal responsibility where we may be 
  at fault.</p>
            <p><i>3. Less attitude / more gra<span class="maintextsubsubhead">t</span>itude</i></p>
            <p>Everyone is human, and thus prone to error and occasional bias. Let's learn 
              to deal with media people as people. In our relationships and communication 
              efforts, let's learn to fan the sparks of honest, fair reporting. 
              Through patient, mature and Krsna conscious application of professional 
              communication techniques, we can work diligently to solve errors 
              and misunderstandings. Simultaneously, we must work to promote an 
              appreciation of socirey at large, within and through the media, 
              of ISKCON's relevancy and its positive social and spiritual contributions 
              to the world. </p>
