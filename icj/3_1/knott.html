            <p><i>The following three statements were made by scholars of religion 
              to represent ISKCON in different forums. Both INFORM and The Institute 
              for the Study of American Religion (ISAR) made their statements 
              for inclusion as evidence in a recent legal challenge brought by 
              ISKCON against alleged misrepresentations by the German Federal 
              Government. The evidence by Dr, Kim Knott was presented at a public 
              enquiry into the proposed change of use and new access for Bhaktivedanta 
              Manor, England. All three are useful for different perspectives 
              and illustrate the importance of good research and academic study 
              into ISKCON, especially when very few people know what it is and 
              what tradition it represents. </i></p>

              Information Network Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM)<br>
              9 August 1994</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Background information on INFORM</p>
            <p>The Information Network Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM) has 
              been asked by the International Society for Krsna Consciousness 
              (ISKCON) to make a statement about our experience of ISKCON and 
              of the social and personal problems to which, in our experience, 
              it gives rise.</p>
            <p>INFORM is a registered charity, based at the London School of Economics, 
              whose overall objective is to help people by providing information 
              about new religious movements that is as accurate and up-to-date 
              as possible. Despite its modest size, INFORM now has one of the 
              world's most comprehensive databases on the subject. It also has 
              an international network of specialists upon whom it can draw and 
              to whom it provides information. It produces literature, arranges 
              seminars, provides speakers for schools, colleges and universities 
              and trains counsellors in problems associated with the new religious 
              movements and the families of their members; it organises support 
              groups for ex-members and for relatives and friends of members, 
              and puts such people in touch with one another on an individual 
              basis when appropriate. In addition, because it is in touch with 
              many of the groups, INFORM is often able to mediate between an enquirer 
              and a movement, getting people back in touch with one another, helping 
              individuals to recover money or property, and generally putting 
              pressure on movements to behave reasonably and compassionately towards 
              ex-members or the families and friends of current members.</p>
            <p>A significant role of INFORM is to be available not only with information 
              but also with understanding and a sympathetic ear when a distraught 
              relative or friend does not know where to turn after learning that 
              someone has joined a new movement about which they know little or 
              nothing. Although INFORM does not tell enquirers what to do, it 
              can offer suggestions about the kind of approaches which are more 
              likely to alleviate than to exacerbate a difficult situation, alerting 
              people to potential problems but reassuring them on matters about 
              which they may be unnecessarily worried. (More detailed information 
              about INFORM'S approach is to be found in the book by Eileen Barker, 
              who started the unit, entitled <i>New Religious Movements: A Practical 
              Introduction</i>, London, HMSO, 1989).</p>
            <p>INFORM was established with the support of the British Home Office 
              and the mainstream Churches, and its Patrons are Lord Dahrendorf 
              (Warden of St Antony's College Oxford, and formerly Director of 
              the London School of Economics), the Archbishop of Canterbury, the 
              Moderator of the Free Church Federal Council and the Roman Catholic 
              Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. When it was set up in 1988, as well 
              as receiving help from the mainstream Churches, INFORM was supported 
              by a substantial three-year grant from the Home Office, which was 
              extended for a further three years to the end of 1993. Since 1988, 
              grants have been given also by a number of trusts and foundations.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Enquiries received in the last full year</p>
            <p>During 1993 we handled 1,017 new enquiries, significantly more 
              than the 727 enquiries received in 1992. A further sixty enquiries 
              were from people who had been in touch with INFORM before and had 
              further questions. Since most enquiries involve contact with more 
              people than the original enquirer, and sometimes with up to six 
              or ten people, INFORM was in touch with more than two thousand people 
              in the course of the year. These were people with whom we were in 
              touch directly, and the number is much larger if one takes account 
              those with whom we were in contact indirectly. As in previous years, 
              the enquiries came from a wide range of people. Many were from relatives 
              of converts to new religious groups, whilst others were from concerned 
              friends, chaplains and parochial clergy, Citizens' Advice Bureaux, 
              Students' Unions and government departments, notably the Home Office. 
              A statistical breakdown of the enquiries shows that 35 % came from 
              relatives, friends and others with personal or pastoral concerns; 
              5 % from members of movements; 5 % from governmental and quasi-governmental 
              agencies; 14 % from students and academics; 25 % from the media; 
              4 % from other organisations, and 12% from other individuals.</p>
            <p>The religious movements about which INFORM received ten or more 
              new enquiries during the year are as follows, with the number of 
              enquiries received in 1992 listed in parentheses.</p>

            <p class="maintextsubhead"> The situation in respect of ISKCON</p>
            <p>By contrast, INFORM received only six enquiries concerning ISKCON 
              in 1993. Of these six, only one was from a person who was worried 
              by the prospect of someone joining the group - the mother of a young 
              man. The mother was concerned that her son had a somewhat unstable 
              personality, and that he might join ISKCON at a period when he was 
              feeling depressed and use his membership of the group as some kind 
              of crutch, rather than working on becoming more mature and stable. 
              When INFORM got in touch with ISKCON, the Society's representative 
              said they 'would not take anyone under eighteen without their parents' 
              written consent', and that they 'liked to involve parents, especially 
              if someone wanted to become a full-time devotee'. The young man's 
              father was encouraged to visit one of the ISKCON centres, where 
              he received the same message and was much reassured.</p>
            <p>Of the remaining five cases, two were from students doing research 
              for essays or dissertations; one was from a member of ISKCON from 
              an Eastern European country who wanted advice on how the group might 
              defend itself against defamation by the anti-cult movement; one 
              was from a reporter from the <i>Catholic Herald</i>, a Roman Catholic 
              weekly newspaper, who was researching an article on ISKCON; and 
              one was from a man who had a friend who had just left ISKCON, and 
              who wanted INFORM to recommend some reading so that he could talk 
              intelligently and sensitively to the friend who had so recently 
              left the group.</p>
            <p>Of these six enquiries, therefore, only one was typical of the 
              many hundreds received by INFORM from distraught friends and relatives 
              of people who have just joined, or are thinking of joining, a new 
              religious movement, and even then was not truly typical of these 
              types of enquiries.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Summary of the experience of INFORM</p>
            <p>In our experience, of all the many new religious movements in existence 
              today, ISKCON gives rise to comparatively few problems or enquiries. 
              It is highly visible and therefore subject to considerable attention, 
              but in the cultural and religious plurality that characterises contemporary 
              Europe, it represents one strand of traditional Indian spirituality. 
              Given its colonial past, this is particularly relevant in the United 
              Kingdom, where the significant numbers of immigrant families from 
              the Indian sub-continent positively welcome the presence of a familiar 
              style of religiousness.</p>

            <p class="maintextsubhead">Dr. J. Gordon Melton. Director<br>
              The Institute for the Study of American Religion<br>
              17 August 1994</p>
            <p>I have been requested to make a statement on the International 
              Society for Krsna Consciousness (ISKCON) with special reference 
              to some specific questions. I am a graduate of Garrett-Evangelical 
              Theological Seminary (MDiv, 1968) and Northwestern University (PhD, 
              1975) with a doctorate in the history and literature of religions. 
              I am the founder and director o the Institute for the Study of American 
              Religion, a research facility in Santa Barbara, California devoted 
              to the study of religious groups and organisations with a special 
              interest in so-called New Religious Movements, i.e., those many 
              groups which have originated in the West or come to the West from 
              other parts of the world and have recruited members from the local 
              populations. I am also (since 1985) a research specialist with the 
              Department of Religious Studies of the University of California 
              Santa Barbara and an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church.</p>
            <p>As part of my official duties I have written some twenty-five books, 
              including two college texts: <i>The Cult</i> Experience (1992) and 
              <i>The Encyclopaedic Handbook of Cults in America </i>(1986, l992). 
              I have also authored a variety of what have become standard reference 
              books including the <i>Encyclopaedia of American Religions</i> (1992); 
              <i>Religious Groups in America: A Directory</i> (1991), and the 
              <i>Encyclopaedia of African American</i> <i>Religions</i> (l993). 
              Along the way, I have consulted with the US Army on the issue of 
              new religions' service in the Armed Forces and assisted the Army 
              Office of Chaplains in the preparation of the several editions of 
              their <i>Handbooks</i> <i>on the Beliefs of Certain Selected Groups</i> 
              (1978, 1991). Some consideration of ISKCON was included in most 
              of the books named above.</p>
            <p>Since I have concentrated my study on New Religious Movements since 
              the 1960s, I have frequently been called into court to speak about 
              various religious groups, including ISKCON. Several of the new religions 
              such as ISKCON have been controversial due to the unfamiliarity 
              of the public with the new and different ideas and practices they 
              espoused. Early concerns voiced by the parents of some young adults 
              in the 1970s, turned into a laundry list of charges against ISKCON 
              and a number of other groups lumped together under the generic name 
              of 'cults' in North America and 'sects' or other labels elsewhere. 
              Much of the scholarly work that has been done on New Religions during 
              the last two decades has been devoted to examining the many charges 
              that have been brought against them.</p>
            <p>Further distorting our research on New Religions has been the insertion 
              of several pseudo-scientific hypotheses concerning the nature of 
              life in groups such as ISKCON. For example, during the 1970s two 
              people, neither with any medical training, announced the discovery 
              of a new disease. Having discovered this new disease, they saw no 
              need to check their findings with anyone with medical training before 
              announcing their findings to the world in a popular text. In spite 
              of their ignorance of medicine and physiology, they asserted that 
              various common religious practices such as prayer, meditation and 
              chanting, including that practised within ISKCON, caused brain damage 
              by denying the brain its 'food', i.e. information. This bizarre 
              idea was presented in a book called <i>Snapping</i>. For a brief 
              time, members of what had by that time become part of an anti-cult 
              network hailed the book and several popular newsstand magazines 
              such as <i>Science Digest</i>, ran articles about it. However, it 
              was never considered a serious scientific hypothesis and after several 
              articles in scientific journals refuting the book's ideas, <i>Snapping</i> 
              soon passed from the scene.</p>
            <p>More recently, several people have espoused the idea of brainwashing 
              (also termed thought control, coercive persuasion or mind control). 
              Proponents suggested that cults had discovered a new psychological 
              technology, a technology that has somehow escaped the rest of the 
              psychological world. With this technology it 'brainwashed' young 
              recruits and held them with such force that they were unable to 
              break the spell of attachment to the group. These ideas, which seemed 
              to have a body of evident behind them, provoked a heated debate 
              amongst social scientists in the early 1980s. In the mid 1980s, 
              the whole brainwashing perspective was thoroughly evaluated by the 
              American Psychological Association. After looking at a detailed 
              report prepared by the major advocates of this perspective, the 
              Association concluded that the idea of brainwashing and mind control, 
              as popularly applied to the new religious movements, was scientifically 
              unacceptable. It had been arrived at through a sloppy methodology 
              and poor scientific work. Subsequently the American Sociological 
              Association and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion 
              reached a similar conclusion. As a result, testimony concerning 
              brainwashing and mind control have properly been banished from consideration 
              by American courts as an idea lacking any scientific credibility.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Concerning ISKCON</p>
            <p>Having made these several general observations, let me turn to 
              some consideration of ISKCON. I have studied this organisation since 
              its emergence into prominence in the early 1970s and its founding 
              of a centre in Chicago, where I was then residing. Because of their 
              unique dress and, to the average Westerner, their unusual practices 
              such as chanting Hindu <i>kirtans</i> on the street, they were most 
              photogenic and were soon singled out to illustrate articles on cults 
              and new religions.</p>
            <p>As we have come to know ISKCON, we have become aware that it is 
              a representative of the mainstream Indian Vaishnava religion and 
              follows the same scriptures used by many denominations of Hindus. 
              In the West they have many followers within the Indian ethnic community 
              and are a part of most Hindu ecumenical organisations in both North 
              America and Europe. As such they follow teachings and practices 
              that have a venerable tradition in India. Also, like most older 
              religions, including Christianity, they follow scriptures which 
              were written centuries ago when modern ideas such as those about 
              democratic government or the rights of women were as yet undeveloped. 
              As most Christians are aware, the Bible is quite compatible with 
              and in many ways, very supportive of autocratic government, and 
              many leading Christian theologians have argued against democratic 
              tendencies. In addition, many Hindu holy books such as the <i>Bhagava-gita 
              </i>show the same compatibility. However, just as Christians have 
              developed a commitment to democratic values, so too have members 
              of ISKCON.</p>
            <p>I have also seen no lack of commitment to the values of family 
              and marriage within ISKCON. However, like the Roman Catholic orders, 
              ISKCON members also place a high value on the celibate ordered life, 
              and a number of its members have become the equivalent of monks 
              and nuns. The value placed on such an ordered life is no more an 
              attack upon the family than that implied in the existence of Franciscans 
              or Dominicans.</p>
            <p>Life in ISKCON, while strange to many Westerners, follows a pattern 
              established many years ago in India. It includes spending regular 
              periods each day chanting a mantra, eating a vegetarian diet and, 
              for some, living a semi-communal lifestyle. While these practices 
              are certainly different from that of most people, there is no evidence 
              that following them have had any harmful effects upon either the 
              Indian public or any person ever affiliated with ISKCON. There is 
              simply no evidence that ISKCON'S religious practices adversely affect 
              mental or physical health. While many anti-cult leaders have repeated 
              such charges over the last two decades, they have failed to provide 
              any supporting evidence. </p>
            <p>It is of note that thousands of people have at some point in time 
              joined ISKCON and later, finding it not to their liking, have left 
              it and re-entered the larger society none the worse for their experience. 
              Others have found it a very happy life, have married and had children, 
              and now see their young adult offspring becoming members. Several 
              weeks ago I attended a convention of young adults born and raised 
              in ISKCON. At that time I had the opportunity to meet with people 
              who have left ISKCON altogether and assumed positions in college 
              and the workplace, those who are marginal members of ISKCON, and 
              those who are full members of the community.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>ISKCON has been forced to spend its formative years in the full 
              light of a sceptical media and within a critical, even hostile, 
              environment. It has been thoroughly scrutinised, in part as a result 
              of several lengthy judicial reviews, for more than two decades. 
              No substantive charges levelled at it have stood the test of such 
              examination. For example, in the case brought by former-member Robin 
              George against ISKCON, it was charged that ex-members could never 
              again reintegrate into 'normal' society or have a stable family 
              life. However, the only people brought to testify to this point 
              were former members who had already by the time they testified been 
              able to find a place in society and develop a new set of acquaintances 
              outside of the group. It turned out that the great majority of charges 
              against ISKCON were simply a standard laundry list of items that 
              have periodically been used against different new religions as public 
              attention moves from one to the other.</p>
            <p>Simply put, ISKCON has been present in the West for twenty-five 
              years. If, in fact, it was a danger to society we would have long 
              ago discovered that threat and dealt with it. Rather than a danger, 
              ISKCON has shown itself capable of developing a religious community 
              within which people alienated from society in the 1970s, have become 
              substantial law-abiding citizens who have in turn developed a programme 
              of service to the community through feeding the poor and other acts 
              of charity. ISKCON does not threaten any country's constitutional 
              freedom. Quite the opposite is true. In a series of cases it has 
              been demonstrated that ISKCON's own constitutional freedom has been 
              continually threatened by having to repeatedly defend itself on 
              issues that had previously been considered by the courts and discarded.</p>
            <p>I am not a follower of ISKCON. On a theological level I can find 
              little with which I agree or with which I resonate. However, as 
              a private citizen, I have no complaints and I would petition this 
              court to act in their favour unless and until it has been demonstrated, 
              by common standards of evidence, that they have acted against the 
              state or have broken specific laws.</p>

            <p>I work as a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Theology and Religious 
              Studies at the University of Leeds. I have made my speciality the 
              study of ethnic minority religions in Britain, principally Hinduism, 
              looking in some detail at their roots, developments, practices, 
              beliefs and needs.</p>
            <p>After graduating in 1976 with a BA Hons in English and Religious 
              Studies and, the following year with an MA in Religious Studies, 
              I proceeded to study for a PhD, awarded in 1982. The title of my 
              doctoral thesis was <i>Hinduism in Leeds: A Study of Religious Practice 
              in the Indian Hindu Community and in Hindu-Related Group</i>&quot;.</p>
            <p>Since then I have been employed by the University of Leeds, first 
              in the Department of Sociology, and from 1983 in the Department 
              of Theology and Religious Studies. In addition to working on various 
              research projects and running the Community Religions Project (CRP, 
              see below), I have taught a variety of courses, including 'Hinduism', 
              'Religions of Asian Communities in Britain' and 'The Sociology of 
              Religion'.</p>
            <p>The Community Religions Project was set up in 1976 with the specific 
              objective of investigating the various religions present in the 
              West Yorkshire area. In 1983 we received funding from the University 
              to extend the brief of the CRP to Britain as a whole, but with the 
              emphasis at that time on the South Asian and Afro-Caribbean religious 
              communities. Our aim in the three-year period from 1983-6 was to 
              conduct a national survey of those religions throughout Britain, 
              and I was employed to work on the South Asian groups. This scheme 
              led me to explore what had been written on Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs 
              in Britain, to collect it for student use, to catalogue it and to 
              encourage the utilisation of it by research students. In 1986 further 
              funding was secured for a four-year period from the Leverhulme Trust. 
              In 1989, I was appointed Lecturer, and, in 1992, Senior Lecturer 
              in Theology and Religious Studies. Among other duties, I have continued 
              to work in the Community Religions Project, and since 1989, have 
              been directing its activities and acting as senior editor for its 
              publications.</p>
            <p>My recent work has included both research and teaching on the religions 
              of Britain's South Asian communities. In 1994-5 I am on research 
              leave working on women and religions in Britain.</p>
            <p>I have published extensively on the subject of Hinduism in Britain. 
              My publications include two books and numerous articles in edited 
              collections and journals, research papers and reviews. In 1986, 
              I published a book entitled <i>My Sweet Lord: The Hare Krsna Movement</i> 
              (Aquarian Press, Wellingborough) as part of a series on new religions 
              edited by Peter Clarke of the Centre for New Religions at King's 
              College, London.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The arrival of the Hindu Community in Great Britain</p>
            <p>Hindus began to arrive in Britain from India in the 1950s. The 
              first to arrive were working men who secured jobs that enabled them 
              to improve the conditions of their families back in India. It was 
              not until the 1960s that they began to send for their wives and 
              children. However, in the 1950s and early sixties the Hindu population 
              was relatively small in comparison to the South Asian Muslims and 
              Sikhs. It was not until the second half of the 1960s and, in particular, 
              the early 1970s, that this population grew substantially in size. 
              Whereas the early migrants had come direct from the Indian sub-continent, 
              generally from the Punjab or Gujarat, the Hindus who began to arrive 
              in this later period came from East Africa, at first from Tanzania 
              and Kenya and in the early 1970s from Uganda. </p>
            <p>Hindus, mostly with their origins in Gujarat in the west of India, 
              had settled in East Africa from the Nineteenth Century onwards when 
              they had arrived as labourers to work on the railroads and as minor 
              administrators in the employ of British colonialists. In the 1960s 
              the political character of many African countries was changing with 
              independence and a growing emphasis was being placed on 'Africanisation'. 
              East African Asians began to feel unwelcome and pressure was put 
              on them to leave. (They were expelled from Uganda by President Amin 
              in 1972-3.) Many of them had British passports owing to their status 
              as citizens of Commonwealth countries and they decided to come to 
              Britain (others went to Canada or India). As a result, the Hindu 
              population in the UK increased considerably in this period (which 
              ended after the Uganda expulsions in the mid-1970s). Census statistics 
              show that, in a number of regions, as many as half the Indian ethnic 
              population is comprised of people born in East Africa. Leicester, 
              for example, is a city with a very large number of East African 
              Asian Hindus. The Hindu population of North West London also increased 
              dramatically in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a result of this 
              series of events.</p>
            <p>I now refer to map one, which shows the areas of concentration 
              of Hindus throughout England at the present time. The different 
              circles give an indication of the proportionate sizes of the various 
              regional communities (although it is recognised that it is impossible 
              to attain exact statistics until such time as a religious question 
              is asked in the national population census).</p>
            <p> There is a large concentration of Hindus, mainly Gujarati, now 
              living in northwest London. The Hindu population there is estimated 
              at approximately 55,000 (in Brent and Harrow) with further small 
              populations in other commuter towns such as Barnet, Watford, Luton, 
              Wellingborough and Northampton (c. 30,000 in total).</p>
            <p>Since the early 1970s there has been no large immigration of Hindus 
              into this country, nor has there been any significant shift in population 
              amongst the Hindu community, although, in recent years, there has 
              been a general movement away from the congested inner-city areas 
              to the suburbs of towns and cities.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The Hindu tradition and Krsna Consciousness</p>
            <p>I have read the statement by Martin Fleming in which he describes 
              the history of Vaisnavism and the role of ISKCON, and I agree with 
              his general description.</p>
            <p>The Indian religious traditions date back over four thousand years. 
              The writers of the early religious texts and Hindus today, refer 
              to their religion as <i>sanatana dharma</i>. In the Nineteenth and 
              Twentieth Centuries, with the impact of the West, the beliefs and 
              practices of <i>sanatana dharma</i> have become known as 'Hinduism'. 
              This is an all-embracing concept used to encompass broad religious 
              movements such as Vaisnavism and Shaivism, and different philosophical 
              perspectives, some monistic and some dualistic.</p>
            <p>In my book, <i>My Sweet Lord: The Hare Krsna Movement</i>, I describe 
              how Krsna Consciousness (the Hare Krsna devotees' name for their 
              religion) is the modern descendent of Caitanya Vaishnavism. Vaishnavism 
              refers to the worship of Vishnu or Krsna, probably the most popular 
              of Hindu deities. Caitanya was a leading social reformer and saint 
              in the Sixteenth Century. He was, among others, responsible for 
              the revival of the <i>bhakti</i> movement of loving devotion to 
              God.</p>
            <p>However, I think that it is unnecessary to understand the historical 
              details in order to appreciate the relationship between Krsna Consciousness 
              and the Hindu tradition. Empirical observations provide sufficient 
              evidence: Hindu people in Britain, India and other parts of the 
              world where Indian communities have established themselves, are 
              committed to the Hare Krsna Movement not just as permanent devotees 
              within the centres but as life members or as practising Hindus for 
              whom Hare Krsna centres are their places of instruction and worship. 
              My observations of other Hindu organisations and <i>sampradaya</i>, 
              sectarian movements based on disciplic lineages, suggest that the 
              temples of the Hare Krsna Movement are exceptional in that Hindus 
              of many kinds are attracted to them because they are seen as part 
              of the mainstream Vaishnava Hinduism. It is not unusual for Bengalis 
              and Punjabis as well as Gujaratis, to attend Bhaktivedanta Manor 
              for the purpose of <i>darshan</i>, seeing the deities, and worship. 
              It is seen by them as a place where they can participate in the 
              kind of religious practice to which they are accustomed in the presence 
              of a deity well-known and much-beloved by them all.</p>
            <p>I think it is also important to note that, in addition to presenting 
              successfully the Hindu tradition to non-Hindus in the West, the 
              Hare Krsna Movement has had an important effect within the Indian 
              community in revitalising the faith of a number of Hindus, young 
              and old alike. In a 1987 book entitled <i>Hinduism in Great Britain</i> 
              (edited by Richard Burghart), Sean Carey establishes that, although 
              the founder of the Hare Krsna Movement, Bhaktivedanta Swami, brought 
              the Hindu philosophy of Krsna Consciousness to the West for non-Hindus 
              (i.e. for people with no background in the Hindu tradition but with 
              an attraction to some of its beliefs and practices), the movement 
              which grew up around it has also become particularly attractive 
              to people who were already practising Vaishnava Hindus. In addition 
              to those devotees following a fully-committed, ascetic path in Krsna 
              Consciousness, Carey mentions the growth in interest of the movement's 
              Indian followers: 'ISKCON has some four thousand 'life-members' 
              ... and the expansion rate is currently about five hundred new members 
              a year. Only a few of these life-members are Westerners, with the 
              bulk of support ... coming from those Gujarati and Punjabi Indians 
              who had previously lived and worked in East Africa' (Carey, p.89).</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Facilities for the practice of Hinduism in Britain</p>
            <p>It is important to note that, for the majority of Hindus, the most 
              significant place for regular religious instruction and worship 
              is the home. However, many Hindus also like to visit a local temple 
              either daily or weekly and, particularly, at times of festivals 
              and special occasions.</p>
            <p>There are thought to be between 80-100 temples in the UK. Maps 
              two and three show the locations of major Hindu temples where members 
              of the communities are able to practise their religion. There are 
              a large number of smaller groups that meet in private homes or public 
              halls that are not included. Only permanent places of worship with 
              installed <i>murti</i> (images of deities consecrated in a <i>pranapratistha</i> 
              ceremony) are shown. A recent directory of religions (edited by 
              Paul Weller and based on data collected by the University of Derby's 
              Religious Research and Resource Centre with the Interfaith Network 
              for the UK) mentions a higher figure of about 130, but this includes 
              some centres without installed <i>murti</i>.</p>
            <p> It is clear from map three that, although there is a concentration 
              of Hindus, mainly Gujaratis, in Northwest London, there is a severe 
              lack of religious facilities for them.</p>
            <p>The only major temple other than Bhaktivedanta Manor in this area 
              is one belonging to the Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, a Gujarati sectarian 
              movement, located in Neasden. The followers who attend this temple 
              focus their religious practices upon reverence to Lord Swaminarayan 
              rather than Krsna or any of the other popular Hindu deities. They 
              have their own distinct scriptures and teachings. Therefore, those 
              Gujarati Hindus in Northwest London who are not followers of Swaminarayan 
              would not be likely to choose to visit this temple on a regular 
              basis or for festivals. </p>
            <p>The members of another sectarian tradition, the Vallabhacharya 
              sampradaya or Pushtimarak, are building a new temple in Wembley 
              (they already have one in Whipps Cross). These Gujarati Pushti margis, 
              'followers of the way of grace', worship Lord Sri Nathji, a form 
              of Krsna. However, many of those Krsna devotees who are not members 
              of this movement would not wish to worship at a Pushtimarak temple. 
              The principal reason for this is that Pushti margis, while worshipping 
              the Sri Nathji form of Krsna, do not worship Krsna's partner, Radha. 
              They do not install <i>murti</i> of Radha in their temples. To many 
              Krsna devotees, Radha is an important deity and is worshipped with 
              equal reverence to Krsna himself. Radha is honoured first in the 
              joint name of the couple, RadhaKrsna. A further reason for some 
              Krsna devotees to eschew attendance at a Pushimarak temple is a 
              fear of inadequate provisions for deity worship. The standard of 
              deity worship within ISKCON is extremely high, requiring that the 
              installed deities receive appropriate care, service and devotion 
              in seven daily acts of worship. Different, lesser standards apply 
              at most other Hindu temples in the UK, including those of the Pushtimarak.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The significance of Bhaktivedanta Manor to British Hindus</p>
            <p>Over the years, Bhaktivedanta Manor has developed into a major 
              centre for Hinduism in Britain. For those dedicated to the philosophy 
              of Krsna Consciousness, the Manor is a Hindu college for education 
              in the principles and practices of this form of Vaishnava Hinduism, 
              and for learning the texts, the disciplined life and the worship 
              of the deities. During the period 1984-5, when I was researching 
              the book <i>My Sweet Lord</i>, I had the opportunity to observe 
              how Bhaktivedanta Manor and the devotees living or visiting there 
              functioned on a day-to-day basis. Bhaktivedanta Manor operates in 
              a similar way to any other Hindu <i>math</i>, college or monastery 
              for personal study and training. It has a similar daily schedule 
              to <i>maths</i> in India, with the members rising early, meditating, 
              studying and worshipping, and many of the same principles and practices 
              are to be found (such as vegetarianism, meditating on prayer beads, 
              a stress on celibacy, teetotalism, worship in a temple room and 
              reading Hindu scriptures). Apart from the major temples of the Swaminarayan 
              Hindu Mission, which operate in this kind of way only when visiting 
              ascetics are in attendance, there are no other Hindu temples in 
              the UK which provide these facilities and to such a high standard.</p>
            <p>For the wider Hindu community, the Manor is important as a place 
              of worship. The standard of deity worship there is of an extremely 
              high order, and is recognised by the Hindu community as such. Having 
              seen a large number of Hindu temples throughout the country, my 
              own observations would support this view. I have not seen a temple 
              in the UK that can offer an equal or higher standard of deity worship. 
            </p>
            <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the Manor has significance 
              not only for those who are adherents of the central tenets of Krsna 
              Consciousness, but also for the wider Hindu public.</p>
            <p>As well as those coming from Northwest London, it is important 
              to note that Hindus pay visits from other parts of the country on 
              what might be called pilgrimages (<i>yatra)</i>. These Hindus may 
              be serviced by local centres, but may still wish to visit the shrine 
              at Bhaktivedanta Manor for special occasions. Pilgrimage is of tremendous 
              importance to Hindus. There is a tradition of religious travel that 
              dates back to the epic literature. It is mentioned in the <i>Mahabharata</i> 
              as a very important activity for spiritual purification. Since then 
              it has been one of the most widely accepted practices of Hinduism, 
              particularly amongst the older generation (eager to see certain 
              sites before they die; even to die at a place of religious importance). 
              The practice is still popular today amongst the Hindus of Britain. 
              Unless they can afford to return to India for this purpose, they 
              go for pilgrimage around the various temples and centres in Britain's 
              towns and cities. Bhaktivedanta Manor has become particularly significant 
              for such purposes.</p>
            <p>In places such as Leicester, Preston, Bristol and Leeds, Hindus 
              may attend their local temples on a regular basis. However, on special 
              occasions, particularly at the time of Hindu festivals, they like 
              to go, as families, on pilgrimage to visit a shrine for <i>darshan</i> 
              (the act of seeing and being seen by the deity). In the case of 
              Bhaktivedanta Manor, the major festivals are Janamastami, the birthday 
              of Lord Krsna, Ramnavmi, the anniversary of Lord Rama, and Diwali, 
              the New Year. Just as they would in India, British Hindus will make 
              pilgrimages to temple sites where particular deities are located. 
              For the worship of Krsna, Bhaktivedanta Manor is foremost among 
              such sites.</p>
            <p> The Manor has particular appeal to pilgrims. It is renowned for 
              the beauty of its shrine. Radha and Krsna, Sita, Rama, Lakshman 
              and Hanuman are all to be seen there, dressed in exquisitely fashioned 
              clothes that are changed daily. They are well-cared for and worshipped 
              with great precision and devotion. This is all of great importance 
              for Hindus. In addition, the setting of the Manor is appealing. 
              Like many Indian pilgrimage sites, it is in beautiful surroundings 
              and is peaceful.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">The festivals and Janamastami</p>
            <p>Religious festivals play an important role in the Hindu calendar. 
              The key aspect to any festival is the worship of the deities, and 
              the particular festival determines how the deities are to be worshipped. 
              During Ramnavmi, for example, the story of the deity Rama, the <i>Ramayana</i>, 
              is read aloud, and during<i> </i>Holi,devotees throw coconuts in 
              a fire, celebrating the victory of goodness over evil.</p>
            <p>By far the most important festival for Krsna devotees is Janamastami, 
              the anniversary of the birth of Krsna. The day is celebrated by 
              visitors taking <i>darshan</i> of Krsna, swinging the baby Krsna 
              in a cradle and seeing the flute-playing Krsna, with Radha, in new 
              clothes and bedecked in flowers and jewels for this special day.</p>
            <p>The Manor's Krsna is, to many local Hindus, their <i>istadeva</i>, 
              personal deity. At Janamastami it is their own Krsna they are coming 
              to see. Having undergone a ceremony of consecration, <i>pranapratistha</i>, 
              in which the image was infused with life-breath and made fit for 
              the habitation of Lord Krsna, the Manor's Krsna now requires the 
              committed care of brahmins and enjoys the loving devotion of his 
              devotees. The manor is now irrevokably the site of this relationship. 
              The <i>murti</i> of Krsna and Radha belong in a sacred sense to 
              the site in which they were consecrated. (The way in which the geographical 
              location of the deity is marked as sacred can be noted in the naming 
              of some forms of Krsna: for example, the form of Krsna which resides 
              at ISKCON's London temple is called <i>'Radha-London-ishvara', </i>Krsna 
              taking the name 'the lord or presiding deity of London').</p>
            <p>The argument has been put to me that Janamastami could take place 
              elsewhere, thus relieving Letchmore Heath of the problem of accommodating 
              visitors on this occasion. In my judgement as a specialist on Hindu 
              religious practice, the spiritual aspirations of the Krsna devotees 
              could not be met if Janamastami were to be held at a site away from 
              the Manor. It is the shrine that is sacred to the devotees. In addition, 
              deities can only be moved from their locations in times of extreme 
              danger to them. Temporary removal is not possible for consecrated 
              <i>deities</i>, only for images of gods or goddesses.</p>
            <p>The activities that take place on Janamastami revolve around the 
              temple deity. The primary activities which bring visitors to the 
              Manor are as follows: (a) <i>darshan</i>, seeing the temple deities, 
              particularly Krsna, whose birthday is being celebrated; (b) singing 
              songs, and receiving food blessed by the temple deity and <i>charanamrta</i>, 
              the nectar of the deity, all in the presence of Krsna; (c) visiting 
              the temple's cows and remembering Krsna's pranks as a cowherder; 
              (d) circumambulating the shrine and walking through the grounds 
              in the company of a small form of Krsna which is used in processions 
              - a practice widely performed in India with <i>murtis</i> reserved 
              specifically for such purposes as distinct from the temple deities 
              themselves). In addition to these, visiting devotees enjoy the opportunity 
              to practise spiritual activities in the privacy and security of 
              a Hindu setting. They may chant the names of Krsna, watch dramas 
              (<i>Krsna-lila</i>), buy devotional books and artefacts and engage 
              in conversations about Krsna and devotional life without worrying 
              about being laughed at, without being the source of amusement, racist 
              abuse or curiosity. </p>
            <p>One final point that needs to be made concerns the Hare Krsna devotees 
              themselves. The present arrangements for Janamastami enable all 
              those who attend to enjoy the occasion to the full. Were the festival 
              to be relocated to another site, quite apart from the spiritual 
              consequences (which I hope I have shown to be fundamental to the 
              very purpose of the festival), the practical problems would be immense. 
              Each Hare Krsna devotee performs many functions on the occasion 
              of the festival. They may be cooking one moment, selling books the 
              next and then performing in a drama. In addition to their role as 
              servants of Krsna on the occasion of his birthday, they are devotees 
              too, needing to take <i>darshan</i> of their beloved God themselves. 
              It is hard to imagine how devotees could manage the logistics of 
              holding the festival in another location, even if it were to make 
              religious sense to do so.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>It has been my intention to explain and provide evidence of three 
              points that I understand to be relevant to this appeal. The first 
              of these was the relationship between ISKCON and its Indian Hindu 
              constituency, the history of its development and its geographical 
              significance in the present case; the second concerned the religious 
              and sectarian distinctions within the Hindu constituency and their 
              relevance for the choice of Bhaktivedanta Manor as a site for worship 
              and pilgrimage. Finally, I examined the theology and practice of 
              Vaisnava Hinduism (as it relates particularly to Krsna) with regard 
              to the worship of the deity and the conduct of festivals, most notably 
              Janamastami. I hope I have been able to show, not only the importance 
              of Bhaktivedanta Manor as a place of worship and spiritual nurture 
              for British Hindus, but also the significance of the deity, the 
              Manor's own Krsna, in drawing devotees to the site. Adding to this 
              my knowledge of temples and pilgrimage in India, I think it important 
              to point out that, even if Bhaktivedanta Manor were to close for 
              public worship, it would remain a site of religious importance, 
              even pilgrimage, for many Hindus precisely because it is identified 
              as a habitation or abode of Krsna.</p>
            <p>As a scholar of the religions of minority communities in Britain, 
              I think it important that the Hindus be enabled to continue in their 
              use of Bhaktivedanta Manor as a centre for worship, spiritual nurture, 
              education and celebration. I recognise that this requires a legal 
              change of use to match current practice. I hope that this can be 
              granted on the basis of new provisions for access.</p>
