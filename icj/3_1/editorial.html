            <p>Changes within ISKCON and the lack of scientific or scholarly 
              research over the last ten years present difficult problems in interpretation 
              today. Previously, members who joined ISKCON became part of an institution 
              which was basically monastic in its lifestyle. Ninety-five percent 
              of its members lived in temples, and there were clear physical distinctions 
              between 'devotees' and '<i>karmis</i>', or non-devotees. Now, after 
              twenty-five years, the question is being asked, 'Where does ISKCON 
              membership begin and where does it end?' At present, ISKCON is debating 
              the issues arising from this distance between its image and its 
              identity. Redefinition, introspection and reorganisation are the 
              order of the day.</p>
<p> Over the last twenty-five years,the social image that ISKCON has had of 
  itself has basically remained the same, whereas its actual identity has changed 
  radically. Now, on average, ninety-five percent of ISKCON members live outside 
  temple communities. This development is encouraged and supported by the philosophy 
  and practice of Krsna consciousness, but it has left the institution itself 
  with more questions than answers. In short, ISKCON is having an identity crisis 
  and thus has embarked on a path of institutional self-realisation. This development 
  has been fast and irreversible.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"
title=""> [i] </a> The model of ISKCON being a society made up of temples crammed 
  full of life-long celibate students is a thing of the past. </p>
<p> The initial appearance of temple <i>ashrams</i> existed to facilitate the 
  Western launch of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's (Srila Prabhupada) orthodox Gaudiya 
  Vaishnavism. Temples were the only places one could go to practise the faith 
  and live the culture. As the years passed, household life naturally developed, 
  both as a result of temple residents marrying and moving outside temples, and 
  through householders joining the society as congregational members.</p>
<p> As more and more Western congregational devotees and members of the ex-patriot 
  Indian community began to request, qualify for and receive initiation by spiritual 
  teachers in ISKCON, the divisions and distinctions between 'temple devotees' 
  and 'congregation' began to blur. Due to the natural increase in the number 
  of middle-aged Hare Krsnas and their experiences of family life, employment 
  and further education, ISKCON's attitude to the family, occupation, other religious 
  traditions, education and social integration is being challenged and discussed 
  in all its corridors.</p>
<p> To illustrate ISKCON's reassessment of itself, I refer you to one critical 
  definition offered in a paper at a conference in Germany<a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [ii] </a>, in January of this year. The 
  definition was an interesting and contemporary clarification of the role of 
  the temple:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The role of the temple or <i>ashram</i> has also changed. ISKCON 
                centres are now places of education, communication and mission, 
                and they serve the congregation as places of worship and association. 
                Vaishnavas who live in the temple receive a spiritual education, 
                after which most of them marry and establish a family (and move 
                out of the <i>ashram</i>).'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This definition proposes a temple role that equates more with the traditional 
  social model proposed in Vedic and Vaishnava texts, where students in temples 
  and <i>ashrams</i> are trained for household life based on spiritual principles. 
  They are then expected to marry, establish their own household and make a positive 
  contribution to society at large. Their relationship with the temple as a training 
  institution then changes to that of a place of worship, and their role changes 
  from submissive student to respected patron.</p>
<p> Since the development of the larger Hare Krsna community, members are less 
  constrained in their social interaction and expression. Thus sub-cultures are 
  beginning to appear within the society: art groups, drama societies, writers, 
  educationalists, thinkers, critics, support groups and independent communities. 
</p>
<p> At a recent reunion of ISKCON's first Irish members, it was noted that 
  none of the people who received initiation had actually left the faith. Some 
  had been institutionally disaffected, and some were not following to the highest 
  spiritual standards, but all still identified themselves as devotees of Krsna 
  and followers of Srila Prabhupada. Of course, Ireland is an ISKCON microcosm, 
  but the same basic trend has been noted worldwide where formal and large scale 
  reunions are becoming common.</p>
<p> Although not everyone welcomes the culture of change and reassessment that 
  has developed within ISKCON, the Society's grass-roots has voted with its feet. 
  Self-analysis and re-evaluation are becoming the norm on all levels of ISKCON 
  organisation. The flood gates are open and negative reaction to social progression 
  within ISKCON itself is now viewed as another valuable contribution to a debate 
  rather than a threat to development or a restriction. The monastic regime of 
  temple and <i>ashram</i> life will always be a valued aspect of ISKCON's culture, 
  but they can no longer be seen to represent the lifestyle led by the majority 
  of its members.</p>
