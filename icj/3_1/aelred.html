            <p><strong><a href="contributors.html#ba">Brother Aelred/Caitanya 
              Dasa</a></strong></p>
<p><i>In this article Brother Aelred (Chaitanya Dasa) offers his observations 
 on the effectiveness of ISKCON's communication of its key messages. These are 
 particularly valuable in view of Brother Aelred's close association with ISKCON 
 over the years and his unusual position of being both a practising Catholic 
 monk and Vaishnava. He is frank and insightful,with a sincere desire to help 
 devotees. As the Scottish poet Robbie Burns once said, 'I pray to God the power 
 to give us, to see ourselves as others see us'. </i></p>
<p>When I first made contact with ISKCON, Prabhupada was still alive. At that 
 time &#8213; 1977 &#8213; I<i> </i>was already 'falling in love' with the devotees. 
 No doubt a percentage of that was romanticism &#8213; being attracted to the 
 externals of exotic appearances, sounds and lifestyle. After all, the sixties 
 'hippy' movement was not so far back in time.</p>
<p> Out of this emerges the first serious observation I wish to make. A significant 
 number of ISKCON devotees are still effectively living in that 'exotic space' 
 of the past. I have asked &#8213; as have others &#8213; whether some devotees 
 would survive without this identity, whose elements include at least some of 
 the Bengali cultural artefacts, the cultivated sense of being 'different' from 
 mainstream society, the conviction of living in a spiritually superior movement, 
 and so on.</p>
<p> The objection may immediately be raised that ISKCON does indeed create 
 and provide a 'spiritually superior society". My response would be that yes, 
 in a variety of ways it does. This is beyond doubt. This is not the content 
 to which I am referring: rather it is the uses that are made of ISKCON's high 
 standards of spiritual discipline. There are occasions when this lifestyle is 
 used as a 'tribal banner', whose purpose is to enforce separation and distinctiveness. 
 Where this is happening, spiritual pride may not be far away; a sectarian mood 
 will certainly be very close. Effective communication with mainstream society 
 will be seriously weakened in such an artificial and negative environment of 
 ideas.</p>
<p> Even more seriously, there is the question of the extent to which various 
 Vaishnava teachings (for example, on reincarnation or specific teachings of 
 Prabhupada such as 'the association of devotees is our only consolation') are 
 used to separate devotees &#8213; at least to some degree unnecessarily &#8213; 
 from citizens in mainstream society.</p>
<p> This 'us and them' mentality interferes with the effective communication 
 necessary for dynamic and convincing preaching. There are sufficient numbers 
 of devotees holding this stance to undermine ISKCON's credibility, at least 
 in the eyes of observant members of the public and government. These tribal 
 attitudes also distort the perceptions and expectations of young devotees who 
 have recently entered the movement.</p>
<p> There is another serious outcome of this mentality: many former enthusiastic 
 Christians have either been blocked in their attempts to reconcile their past 
 with their Vaishnava present or have developed a great burden of personal guilt 
 and ambivalence with respect to their ongoing devotional attachment to Jesus 
 Christ. I am now speaking from personal experience in counselling such devotees.</p>
<p> This crisis of 'Who am I? Where am I? What can I do with my continuing 
 (secret) devotion to Jesus?' can create very real distress. Sadly, such devotees 
 usually report that they have gone for years without finding anyone within the 
 temple with whom they can share their confusion and distress. Obviously, I am 
 delighted that I can contribute to 'setting the record straight' by sharing 
 with them the many wonderful things which Prabhupada said about devotion to 
 Jesus Christ (though not about Christianity as it is so often practised) I can 
 also share with them the story of one who has successfully 'married' the two 
 traditions, Vaishnava and Roman Catholic - my own story. This has been a major 
 reason for publishing my most recent book <i>Prabhupada Speaks on Jesus Christ</i>. 
 Devotees have told me that they had no idea that Prabhupada said such wonderful 
 things about Jesus, and about the significance of devotion to Him.</p>
<p> I have gradually come to the conclusion that many of the difficulties in 
 the area of communication experienced by ISKCON &#8213; both intra and inter 
 &#8213; have arisen from a relative lack of systematic application of Vaishnava 
 and Bhaktivedanta teachings. In other words, there tends to be a naive view 
 that it is sufficient to simply quote <i>Srimad Bhagavatam,</i> <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> 
 or Prabhupada's words , for a matter or issue to be resolved. This is what is 
 happening &#8213; at least sometimes &#8213; when the call goes out in a particular 
 temple that there should be 'a return to Prabhupada and the basics'. </p>
<p> But this may not be enough in some situations, especially if they are complex 
 or ambiguous. We might consider, for example, the role of ISKCON women in management 
 and other forms of leadership. Very often there will need to be in-depth analysis 
 where although what Prabhupada taught or said is the basic reference point, 
 there may need to be an application of his instruction (or indeed an adaptation 
 of it) rather than a simple repeating of it. This application may involve devotees 
 entering areas of debate which Prabhupada himself did not envisage in his lifetime. 
 I think that we may expect this to happen with increasing frequency as the Movement 
 goes into the ternty-first century . and beyond. Social pressures, demands, 
 developments and technologies are set to change on a massive scale, and I fear 
 that our 'born-again fundamentalists' will be left behind.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p> The very nature of our time incurs a need for real ideas. We 
                live in a rudderless age of transition and ideas are anchors, 
                Pole Stars, that have always been there and are still, if only 
                we might know how to recognise them. That recognition is to a 
                great extent dependent on the language used to convey them. We 
                need a manner of speaking that addresses our present condition 
                and is echoed in our personal experience<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I put it to my readers that 'tribal mentality' is a great enemy of 'real 
 ideas' and 'manner of speaking that addresses our present condition'. It also 
 smothers the language of 'personal experience'.   </p>
<p> Yet having said all this, I am greatly encouraged to share with you some 
 of the conclusions emerging from a Ph.D thesis written by an Australian Anglican 
 priest who is a good friend of ISKCON. Fr. Ian Hunter's thesis is entitled <i>Some 
 Aspects of the Religious, Social and Personal Lives</i> <i>of Hare Krishna Devotees 
 Exploring the Social Integration of the International Society for Krishna</i> 
 <i>Consciousness</i>'. (1993)</p>
<p> I repeat what I said at the beginning, that what I have written is based 
 on personal observation. My conclusions will be more or less valid according 
 to which part of the ISKCON 'landscape' is being explored. For this reason it 
 is enlightening to have access to this piece of sociological research, with 
 whichwe move beyond the personal and anecdotal (whatever validity these may 
 have) into conclusions based on disciplined scholarship. In quoting some of 
 Ian Hunter's conclusions, therefore, I hope that I am providing a reasonable 
 perspective:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>(1) . it is a tempting supposition that conversion to most other 
                alternative religions would have occurred mainly in moments of 
                crisis ... My experience, and that of most clergy, leads to that 
                supposition, and this factor alone accounts for the sometimes 
                surprised reaction of most conventional religionists when they 
                actually get to know ISKCON devotees.</p>
              <p> It is quite plain that for the most part, their experiences 
                of family of origin and circumstances of origin<i>,</i> is regarded 
                as an important spiritual foundation for their lives in Krishna 
                Consciousness.</p>
              <p> ... as having close mental and emotional ties with their families 
                and<i> </i>circumstances of<i> </i>origin (including<i> </i>religion 
                of origin) and through them, a strong sense of identification 
                with the general society outside of ISKCON.</p>
              <p>(2) . Generally speaking, the ISKCON devotees in Australia present 
                as mature religionists who welcome and even attempt to initiate 
                such changes (a process of maturing) ... These changes can do 
                nothing except forge more sympathetic connections with Australian 
                Society generally and would certainly be the motive for devotees 
                presenting themselves as constructive social beings and good citizens.</p>
              <p>(3) ... it is possible to make a cautious affirmation that the 
                interviewees were more closely drawn into normal society as useful 
                social beings because of the concept (personalist) of God they 
                had adopted ... like a key which unlocks their ability to make 
                sense of the world because they can at last make sense o f God.</p>
              <p> Without this, there would have been few points of contact for 
                most of them (the ISKCON devotees) with ordinary social interaction 
                and certainly no sympathetic interaction with anyone in ordinary 
                secular society ...</p>
              <p> Yet, for those who possess it, the 'personalism' of ISKCON's 
                view of God, makes personal interaction with society at large 
                possible for the devotees, where it might well have been problematic 
                without it.</p>
              <p>(4) ... The comments of Balarama and Stoka Krishna illustrate 
                that existential significance for them meant a definite closing 
                of the gap between religion and the outside world with which they 
                wished to relate more fully ...</p>
              <p>(5) ... The enthusiasm of the convert is still with all of the 
                group and yet each seemed determined to respect the world outside 
                ISKCON, although they regarded it as being enmeshed in dangerous 
                illusion (<i>maya</i>). So there is a definite sense of belonging 
                to secular society, even if there is an intense desire to save 
                that society from its own self-imposed destruction by preaching 
                to it the tenets of Gaudiya Vaishnavism ...</p>
              <p>(6) In many cases, membership of ISKCON seems to have healed 
                a perceived breach with Australian society experienced by the 
                interviewees in that ISKCON devotees are certainly better functioning 
                social entities than members of the 'hippie' culture or disillusioned 
                social nihilists ...</p>
              <p>(7) ... it cannot be denied that alternative religions can and 
                do encourage a feeling of superiority in their members, and this 
                can often blend with psychopathology of some converts ...</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There would be as many potentially dangerous psychopaths in ISKCON Australia 
 as there are in any other alternative religion ... (some individual devotees) 
 are conspicuous by their scarcely-stifled anger at the outside world. It could 
 be argued that these people would be much more dangerous in a religious system 
 other than ISKCON which has powerful doctrinal and communal inhibitors which 
 prevent that anger surfacing in anti-social ways ...  </p>
<p> ISKCON is a 'new' old movement &#8213; in the West, that is. When I think 
 of the history of ancient Christianity &#8213; in particular the first five 
 centuries &#8213; I consider that ISKCON has done, and is doing, remarkably 
 well. Vaishnavism in the West stands up well by comparison, but that is certainly 
 no reason for smugness or complacency. The familiar dangers are always there.</p>
<p> One of the main dangers is the assumption that because ISKCON is Prabhupada's 
 movement and the modern extension of Lord Caitanya's <i>sankirtana</i> movement, 
 'ordinary' fundamentals of social communication are 'beneath notice'; that Krishna's 
 service is 'over and above' such mundane considerations.</p>
