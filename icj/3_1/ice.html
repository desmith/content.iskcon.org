            <p>Hare Krsna followers in America have been violently attacked for 
              the third time in six months. The most recent attack, which took 
              place on 18 April, destroyed the temple in Yerevan and left twelve 
              devotees, including a woman and an invalid, requiring hospital treatment. 
              Devotees are now in hiding and in fear of further beatings.</p>
            <p> The attack on the Hare Krsna community was the most brutal of 
              a number of assaults involving various minority religious organisations 
              in the last two weeks of April. Marina Kutzian, senior lecturer 
              in Sociology at Yerevan University stated, 'I want to underline 
              that in all these cases one funds the same signature. One or two 
              cars with people in military uniform, at least some of them in that 
              kind of clothing, drive up to a place and attack people. There is 
              no reaction by the police. </p>
            <p> In the case of the Hare Krsnas, victims had bloody wounds, the 
              temple was destroyed all property was stolen. From my impression 
              and informal information that I was able to collect, a paramilitary 
              group did this. This paramilitary group was organised in Armenia 
              before our national army was established. </p>
            <p> On the one hand it is not official, but on the other hand it is 
              well known that they are supervised by government officials, especially 
              by the Minister of Defence. I have the very strong impression that 
              this group is now used by officials against their ideological opponents.'</p>
            <p> The Armenian daily newspaper, <i>Golos Armenyi</i>, wrote on 27 
              April, 'It seems that in our society there is a group of absolutely 
              defenceless people, who can be constantly beaten and terrorised.' 
              Later in the report it stated, 'In other words, we are dealing with 
              a case of pre-planned and widespread assault (on various religions).'</p>
            <p> The Pentecostal, Baptist, Seventh Day Adventist, Baha'i and Charismatic 
              Churches were also harassed. Hallmark features of all these attacks 
              are:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>the involvement of the paramilitary forces;<br>
                the fact that the police ignore complaints and fail to offer any 
                protection to vulnerable communities;<br>
                the neglect of the Armenian Church to offer protection to minority 
                religions and their false accusations which lend sympathy to the 
                motivations of assailants;<br>
                the failure of the government to offer any security to minorities 
                or to apprehend or control attackers.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The American embassy in Yerevan have also compiled a background 
              report on the recent attacks.</p>
            <p class="maintextsubhead">ISKCON report on the attack</p>
            <p>On 18 April 1995 at 3.00 p.m. (local time) twenty to twenty-five 
              unknown men stormed the ISKCON temple in Yerevan.</p>
            <p> At the time of the attack, seventeen people were present in the 
              temple (eleven males, four females and three children). The thugs 
              were armed with automatic weapons, sub-machine guns, guns, metal 
              rods and metal chains. They arrived in three cars with no registration 
              plates.</p>
            <p> The intruders immediately began to severely beat all the people 
              present, kicking them and hitting them with metal rods. After a 
              short time, the ladies and children were thrown out of the house 
              but the men continued to be beaten. Amongst those singled out for 
              a more vicious assault were an invalid and a Russian national.</p>
            <p> As these assaults were taking place, other members of the group 
              were destroying the temple. They desecrated and destroyed the altar, 
              the paraphernalia for worship, scriptures and paintings. All the 
              windows and household fixtures were also damaged.</p>
            <p> The raid lasted about forty-five minutes and before they left 
              the intruders stole everything of value that they could find. Three 
              thousand US dollars in cash was stolen, as were telephones, a fax 
              machine, a computer, a printer, modem, a video camera, two video 
              recorders, a small marble table, and even foodstuff and pots from 
              the kitchen.</p>
            <p> The police were alerted several times by various people but although 
              they said they would come, no-one arrived. In an effort to appeal 
              for help, one devotee, covered in blood, went to the police station. 
              His petitions were ignored, although one policeman commented that 
              this had happened because the Hare Krsna members were deviating 
              from the national tradition.</p>
            <p> Shortly after this incident, a well-dressed man walked into the 
              temple and announced that this attack happened because the Hare 
              Krsna followers did not adhere to the National Church. He then left 
              in a Russian-made Volga car without registration plates.</p>
            <p> Most of the people beaten were severely injured and had to receive 
              hospital treatment. All of the male devotees sustained head injuries.</p>
