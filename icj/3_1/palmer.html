              Author: Susan Jean Palmer<br>
              Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
              First published 1994<br>
              ISBN 0-8156-0297-9</p>
            <p>Susan Palmer, a lecturer in religion at Dawson College in Quebec, 
              has begun this book with a thesis that I am very much interested 
              in. She explains that whilst doing research of NRMs she observed 
              the religious participants regulating (or at least feeling the need 
              to explain) their sexuality in a way that is consonant with their 
              new mystical orientation. Exploring this theme, and with research 
              clearly set in the background of the post World War Two family life 
              and the resulting dramatic changes it has brought to gender roles 
              in society, this book promised to be an interesting read.</p>
            <p> In her attempt to catalogue the varieties of approaches to sexuality 
              and gender distinctions within these NRMs, Palmer has borrowed categories 
              from Christian philosophy by breaking them into three areas:</p>
            <p>(1)        Groups who regard each sex gender as being endowed with 
              different spiritual qualities tend to emphasise marriage as a way 
              of uniting these two incomplete halves of a whole being. And she 
              found that these type of groups often have an androgynous godhead 
              figure. She calls this type of group Sex Complementarity and includes 
              within them the Unification Church, the Mormons, the Institute of 
              Applied Metaphysics and the Messianic Community.</p>
            <p>(2)        Shamanistic or gnostic-type groups generally see the 
              body and its gender as a superficial layer of false identity which 
              is obscuring the immortal and sexless soul. They advocate an inner 
              distance from traditional sex roles. Palmer calls these Sex Unity 
              groups and includes within them the Raelian Movement, the Insitute 
              for the Development of the Harmonious Human Being, the Scientologists 
              and Gold.</p>
            <p>(3)        Sex Polarity groups view the sexes as 'spiritually distinct, 
              separate and inessential or irrelevant to the other's salvation. 
              Levels of salvation might be quite different for men and women because 
              they are not considered spiritually equal. Usually, men are considered 
              the superior sex, as in ISKCON and the 3HO, but Rajneesh, Dada Lekhraj 
              and Mary Daly view women as superior to men. The notion of pollution 
              is sometimes present and the sexes are segregated to avoid weakening 
              each other's spiritual resolve. Often the sexes are permitted to 
              engage in limited, highly controlled relationships as a necessary 
              phase in their spiritual development, or to contribute children 
              to the group.'</p>
            <p>At the outset of her research for this book, Palmer asked what 
              I consider a very useful question: 'What use are women and men to 
              each other on the spiritual path? Are they viewed as impediments 
              to each other's progress, co-dependents mutually assisting in the 
              climb toward salvation or are they equal but independent companions?' 
              I think that our society would have certainly benefited from the 
              contribution such a study could offer to our still sometimes unclear 
              area of gender roles within ISKCON.</p>
            <p> However, I feel that the study's findings are seriously flawed 
              by the next step in which the author proceeds to gather her evidence. 
              She has admirably tried to gain a real sense of what the women living 
              these lifestyles feel, and to present their own understanding of 
              their experiences. She is aware of (and indeed, mentions) the fact 
              that the media, fundamentalists and anticultists have a tendency 
              to trivialise or satirise any practices they find incomprehensible 
              to their own experience. Her way of gathering this evidence, therefore, 
              was to pose the following questions to her querents: Which social 
              / sexual problems did they feel they were attempting to resolve 
              by moving into a religious commune? What did they hope to leave 
              behind? What did they perceive as the primary emotional or sexual 
              diseases in contemporary society which drove them to seek a spiritually 
              based style of sexuality?</p>
            <p> The questions in themselves are reasonable enough, and perhaps 
              if given a wide enough sampling of the members of an individual 
              NRM would be able to give valuable information on the sort of person 
              who joins it and why such a radical approach to sexual roles is 
              attractive to them. The problem here is that (at least in ISKCON's 
              case) such a small sampling of members has been interviewed that 
              the conclusions are virtually useless.</p>
            <p> One of her general observations was that many of the women in 
              NRMs had come from either broken or somewhat disillusioning relationships, 
              and so appreciated the new religious environment as 'an honourable 
              time out from their dilemmas'. She feels that both the 'mothers' 
              in ISKCON and the 'sisters' in the Unification Church are 'responding 
              to the devaluation of traditional women's roles, and to the confusion 
              surrounding issues of gender, rather than rebelling against the 
              narrowness and rigidity of family life ... '</p>
            <p> With specific regard to women in ISKCON, Palmer concludes, 'Women 
              joining the Krsna consciousness movement tend to be young - in their 
              late teens to early twenties - and tend to be from middle- to upper-middle-class 
              families. Judging from the interviews, they remember their family 
              life as materially privileged but dysfunctional, and themselves 
              as abused or neglected children. Many of them appear to be exchanging 
              the uncontrolled, arbitrary patriarchy of their fathers' rule for 
              what they consider a benevolent system of male protection based 
              on the authority of an ancient lineage of guru succession. The ISKCON 
              community, therefore, beckons to these women as a safe haven where 
              masculine tyranny and passion has no place; where they will find 
              protection and will not be sexually exploited.' I am not disputing 
              that these may indeed be correct conclusions across the board in 
              our society; however, it can not be demonstrated bearing in mind 
              the limited scope of her interviewees.</p>
            <p> Palmer obtained information collected in previous studies of devotees 
              as well as <i>Back to</i> <i>Godhead</i> articles specifically dealing 
              with this subject. This is quite fair of her to have done, and does 
              give a bit of a wider scope to her assertions. However, the major 
              flaw in this work lies in that the interviewees to whom she specifically 
              put her questions were extremely few. Padyavali Dasi has contributed 
              most of the material from which Palmer draws her conclusions. She 
              has also quoted interview material from Parvati Dasi and Jadurani 
              Dasi, although it should be noted that Padyavali's comments are 
              reported at least seventy percent more than any other sources. To 
              substantiate her claim that women join ISKCON seeking 'refuge from 
              family conflicts, sexual problems, and career pressures' Palmer 
              briefly recounts sad stories of flight from abusive/ dysfunctional 
              family situations of five women in the Montreal temple. I take exception 
              with this as being a valid cross-section of the women who join ISKCON, 
              in that these women were all aged twenty-four or younger and also 
              that they were all under the same roof as Padyavali Dasi. Within 
              ISKCON it is well observed that different temples have different 
              ambiences, and hence attract different types of people joining it. 
              Had Palmer understood that, rather than accepting that Montreal 
              was typical and absolutely representative of all ISKCON temples, 
              she may well have ensured that her study contained a broader base 
              of ISKCON devotees (at least in North America, as the series title 
              is <i>Women and Gender in North American Religions</i>).</p>
            <p> Aside from critiquing the base from which these conclusions are 
              derived, there are several things in the book which do not present 
              ISKCON in a very favourable light. It would be comfortable to dismiss 
              them with a wave of our righteous hand, claiming once again misrepresentation 
              or misunderstanding by an academic. However, the fact is she has 
              represented at least one section of our ISKCON community, embarrassingly 
              exposing the fact that at least in our assignations of gender roles 
              within ISKCON many of us are quite confused. </p>
            <p>For instance, Padyavali Prabhu is quoted as saying, ' ... a man's 
              body is a finer instrument for developing Krsna consciousness and 
              if he remains celibate he becomes very powerful. Within the semen 
              is contained the spirit soul: all children come from the body of 
              man. It takes three cups of blood to produce just one drop of semen 
              and one drop is enough to dispel the thirty-two hundred diseases 
              of the body, according to Vedic medicine. The semen is lifted by 
              the life airs to the brain where it bathes the brain and creates 
              intelligence. We have a saying: "Man has the power of discrimination; 
              woman has the power of inspiration". Since a woman's body lacks 
              this substance, you'll find that they all have a blind spot.' I 
              find that shocking, and if it is truly ISKCON's institutional position 
              on the distinction between the roles of men and women in our society, 
              I must not be able to understand it due to my 'blind spot'. </p>
            <p> Palmer spends quite a lot of time (understandably given the topic 
              of her book) on the purpose of marriage in our society. Once again 
              Padyavali's explanation here astounds me: 'If a man becomes too 
              attached to his wife, or too interested in women, he is in danger 
              of coming back in the body of a woman. Women are often men who were 
              attached to women in their last life. It is the opposite for a woman. 
              The more attached she is to her husband, the more devoted she is 
              to him, the more likely she is to advance spiritually <i>and be 
              reborn as a man.</i>' (emphasis mine) </p>
            <p> In covering this topic Palmer has also interviewed two or three 
              men regarding their views of marriage. These could almost be construed 
              as parody material for a send-up we might do in a humorous pantomime, 
              if it wasn't so typically representative of the assumptions in operation. 
              She has correctly captured the embarrassing loss of spiritual status 
              accredited to becoming a householder for men. One male devotee interviewed 
              claimed to try to put off his wedding date 'as long as possible'. 
            </p>
            <p> However, for me, the most depressing part of this book was the 
              explanation by a male devotee of why he was giving up twelve years 
              of <i>brahmacari</i> life to marry: 'I was never interested in her 
              until she let me know she was interested in me. Then I began to 
              observe that my mind was agitated after I spoke to her. I could 
              see it coming and was trying to figure out how to escape. I thought 
              of disappearing and going to India, but I had responsibilities here. 
              I had to serve our large Indian congregation and it would be a bad 
              example for the young boys. So I tried to avoid her. Then the night 
              the restaurant burned down, I was up all night trying to save the 
              furniture. Everyone was running around and I was exhausted. She 
              came over and talked to me and twisted my arm, and I was too weak 
              to run away. I guess we really have been engaged for a long time 
              - I just needed time to accept it. Anyway, women need men to protect 
              them. It's not good for a women to live without a husband for too 
              long. I've been in the movement for twelve years and I've seen what 
              happens to Mothers who live in the ladies' ashram - they go a bit 
              crazy! She's been in the movement ten years, she's a disciple of 
              Srila Prabhupada, and there aren't so many of us around anymore. 
              I don't know what I'm going to tell my initiating guru - he's in 
              Toronto, and he has all these big plans for me.' Unfortunately, 
              I fear that this rather typifies the macho chauvinistic attitude 
              many of our men have towards marriage, where they can't even say 
              that they want to marry someone. This poor man felt what is probably 
              a quite typical denial, conveniently placing the blame on the woman 
              for enticing him and then resignedly trying to rationalise his decision 
              as being charitable to her; that he is going to make the supreme 
              sacrifice of giving up his spiritual advancement in order to keep 
              some poor women from going crazy because she's not having sex. Is 
              it any wonder we've had so much heated discussion between the sexes 
              about our respective roles?</p>
            <p> Palmer collected her interviews between 1974 and 1976. Whilst 
              she gives a parenthetical disclaimer that the views expressed by 
              the men were more typical of an earlier ISKCON, 'before the communal 
              structure declined', and explaining that a more positive value is 
              awarded to marriage today, the book has been still published with 
              the claim on the inside cover that the 'study will be of great interest 
              to those seeking information about these new religious movements 
              ... " I'm sure it will. It will stand as a reference tool to be 
              quoted in many other books and essays. </p>
            <p> At least three other women and I were given an opportunity to 
              critique the manuscript before it went to press. It came to me at 
              the time of the reunion at Bhaktivedanta Manor when there were many 
              senior female Prabhupada disciples present. I was able to arrange 
              for us to sit and read the manuscript with a tape recorder to register 
              our objection that it did not represent us. We were assured by Ms 
              Palmer that although she could not do the major rewrite we were 
              suggesting, she would include our comments (or at least a note of 
              them) somewhere in the book. I was subsequently disappointed to 
              find no mention of them anywhere. Thus it stands as it is, with 
              Padyavali Dasi's personal views presented as the de facto representation 
              of the role of women in our society.</p>
            <p> I would recommend this book to be read by anyone interested in 
              what it is that women in ISKCON today are complaining about, as 
              it these very attitudes that articulate women devotees are trying 
              to address in order to ensure they are not passed on to the second 
              and third generations. Let us at least use this text as an exercise 
              in observing <i>neti neti</i> what shapes our gender role definitions. 
              Perhaps in the future a more circumspect academic will do the study 
              properly, giving us (and society) a more accurate analysis so that 
              we may be able to sift through what we have taken from the <i>parampara</i> 
              and what we have brought with us from our mother cultures.</p>
            <p> This should be a lesson to any devotees working with sociologists 
              studying our movement, to encourage them to use as broad a base 
              of research subjects as possible, so that future books do not contain 
              such a lop-sided representation on any aspect of our Society. </p>
            <p> As a rather nice footnote, the only picture on the cover is a 
              lovely devotee bride throwing grains into her wedding ceremony fire.</p>
