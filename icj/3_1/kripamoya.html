              Dasa</a></p>
<p><i>"The saintly teachers have ensured that the essence of Vaishnava wisdom 
  always remains the same - but they have never failed to respond to a changing 
  cultural climate in order to bring others closer to that wisdom". Kripamoya 
  dasa is one of ISKCON's foremost thinkers in the field of congregational development 
  and nama-hatta. In the following article he offers us some very practical suggestions 
  to help us plan and improve our relationships with our members. Kripamoya's 
  description of his innovative nama-hatta convention and the feedback he received 
  from the participants proposes a simples exercise we could all try to repeat.</i></p>
<p>The other day I had to make a long train journey to Manchester, some three 
  hours north of London, so I took the opportunity to read <i>Navadwipa Mahatmya 
  </i>by Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura. In this book, which is an account of Nityananda 
  Prabhu taking Jiva Goswami on a pilgrimage around the holy land of Navadwipa, 
  Bhaktivinode Thakura describes the simultaneous oneness and difference of Sri 
  Vrindavan Dhama and Sri Navadwipa Dhama. In Vrindavan Krsna dances with the 
  <i>gopis,</i> and in Navadwipa, the holy place where Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu 
  is ever present, that same <i>rasa</i> is imbued with magnanimity - the closed 
  circle of the <i>rasa</i> dance has been opened so that all living entities 
  can take part. </p>
<p> Reflection on Krsna's compassionate outreach as His own devotee, led me 
  to consider how in our Vaisnava <i>parampara</i> two things have always been 
  going on simultaneously: one is the preservation of the Supreme Lord's teachings, 
  unchanged over thousands of years; the other is the ever-changing way in which 
  those teachings are made comprehensible to masses of ordinary people. The saintly 
  teachers have ensured that the essence of Vaisnava wisdom always remains the 
  same - but they have never failed to respond to a changing cultural climate 
  in order to bring others closer to that wisdom. That sensitive response to change 
  is based on their compassionate desire to communicate, and it has ensured that 
  our <i>sampradaya</i> has always remained dynamic and relevant to the people 
  of the day. </p>
<p> Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took <i>sannyasa</i> simply to reach out to 
  those who would only take His messages seriously if He did so. The Six Goswamis 
  of Vrindavan were known as the greatest philosophers, and yet they took the 
  time and trouble to extract the essence from all the <i>dharma sastras </i>in 
  order to convey a simple message to ordinary people. The result was that common 
  people were able to follow their simplified teachings, and loved them for giving 
  them Krsna. </p>
<p> It is perhaps interesting to note that even though the Six Goswamis were 
  usually depicted wearing nothing but loincloths and discussing Krsna underneath 
  the trees in Vrindavan's forests, they nevertheless developed between themselves 
  an organisation involving many devotees, all with their own specialised areas 
  of responsibility. Since Caitanya Mahaprabhu had given them certain physical 
  tasks to perform such as writing books, discovering the lost holy places of 
  Vrindavan and establishing temples, they had to organise their collective practice 
  and preaching in such a way that these objectives could be met. Hence, each 
  Goswami and his disciples took a particular role. They named their organisation 
  the Vishva Vaisnava Raja Sabha and there were divisions of responsibility for 
  standards of Deity worship, purity of preaching, awards for recognition of study 
  and service, and yet another division for challenging philosophies which opposed 
  the Vaisnava conclusion. </p>
<p> Sometimes one may not think of the terms 'spiritual' and 'organisation' 
  as being compatible, yet when a Vaisnava is trying to achieve a spiritual purpose 
  within the material world, material energy must be moved in such a way as to 
  ensure the divine objective is met. Krsna chose to speak <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>to 
  Arjuna, not simply because Arjuna was His devotee, but also because he was uniquely 
  qualified to achieve His aim, winning the battle of Kuruksetra. Indeed, this 
  juxtaposition of divine objective and material arrangement is perfectly represented 
  by the speaking of <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and the events which followed over the 
  eighteen days of the battle.</p>
<p> Awakening the dormant love for Krsna in the hearts of mass numbers of people 
  has to be done with careful consideration for the prevailing circumstances, 
  language and customs. The message of Krsna consciousness and its ultimate purpose 
  remain the same but the means are, by necessity, different. Narottama dasa Thakura, 
  for instance, took the knowledge contained within the Sanskrit works of the 
  Goswamis and translated it into Bengali poetry. Sanskrit at that time was the 
  language of scholars, yet Bengali was the common language of those to whom Narottama 
  wished to communicate. He played musical instruments which captivated the minds 
  of simple people and framed his poetry into songs which they could continue 
  to sing long after he had left their particular village. </p>
<p> However, not everyone is satisfied by circumstantial adjustments. If we 
  examine Vaisnava history, or indeed the history of any religious tradition, 
  we will find that conflict always develops between those who are committed to 
  preserving the tradition and those who wish to make the essence of that tradition 
  accessible to all. Representing religious teachings to a world which has changed 
  since those teachings were first recorded, often involves employment of translations 
  or adapted language, a fresh look at prevailing intellectual arguments and in 
  most cases, a departure from traditional styles of teaching. For a long-established 
  religious body it may involve a departure from forms and structures which, although 
  'traditional', have now become stereotyped and inefficient. Such departures 
  will seldom be viewed without protest. </p>
<p> In the Eighteenth Century, Vishvanath Chakravati Thakura wrote books such 
  as <i>Madhurya Kadambini </i>in Bengali even after receiving death threats from 
  dacoits employed by <i>brahmanas</i> who strongly objected to his literary use 
  of vernacular language. Bhaktivinode Thakura struggled for years to establish 
  the pure message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the face of so many sentimental religionists 
  and pseudo Vaisnavas. He too, framed erudite philosophy in popular songs. He 
  employed the popular melodies of the day, which themselves were conjured up 
  by <i>sahajiyas</i> like the Bauls, and used these tunes to accompany his poetry. 
  He wrote in English and thereby created an opportunity for millions of people 
  to take part in Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement. He also transgressed the social 
  norms of the day by discarding threads for his <i>brahmana</i> family disciples 
  in order to establish Vaisnava equality amongst all his followers. More importantly, 
  he also waged a physical battle against dacoits and robbers who were plundering 
  pilgrims on the way to Vrindavan, as well as yogis and mystics who were exploiting 
  common people in the countryside around Jagannatha Puri. His life is an interesting 
  example of a Vaisnava <i>acarya</i> undertaking social reform in order to accomplish 
  divine objectives, and stirring up opposition when such reforms threatened the 
  accepted order. </p>
<p> By the time of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, we see different 
  approaches to achieving the same aim. Whereas his father, Bhaktivinode Thakura, 
  had established Nama Hatta groups in the Bengal countryside, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 
  saw the need for an organised preaching mission that would produce the needed 
  <i>brahmacari</i> recruits and preachers whose renunciation and learning were 
  respected in society. In his day the Rama Krsna Mission had already become popular 
  and the members of this group wore saffron cloth. British Imperialist culture 
  dominated India at that time and this ruling culture was epitomised by grey 
  suits and boots. Rather uniquely, Bhaktisiddhanta adopted both forms of dress 
  for members of his mission, coining the maxim: 'Books are the basis, purity 
  is the force, preaching is the essence, utility is the principle'.</p>
<p> Whilst his purity was appreciated, the rather novel way in which he enacted 
  the fourth line of the maxim - 'utility is the principle' - was severely contested 
  by the <i>brahmanas</i> of the day, even to the extent of both him and his disciples 
  being stoned and shunned. He used motor vehicles, steam ships and printing presses, 
  all of which were seen to be materially indulgent for a <i>sannyasi</i> who 
  had ostensibly renounced the world. However, Bhaktisiddanta had seen the changing 
  circumstances and adjusted his preaching accordingly. </p>
<p> His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada took the purity of 
  the Gaudiya Math mission and brought the teachings into a Western context. Rather 
  than translate his spiritual master's works into English, he wrote entirely 
  fresh commentaries, specifically for the Western mind. Striving to establish 
  ISKCON, an international missionary body of highly committed young men and women, 
  he made changes in preaching style which horrified many of his contemporaries. 
  He mixed 'boys and girls' in the same <i>ashrams</i> and sent them both out 
  to sell his books. He reduced the number of rounds required for initiation from 
  sixty-four to sixteen simply to help his new Western students. He used every 
  modern device he could, and travelled by aeroplane at regular intervals. By 
  so doing he built a simple, yet highly efficient, international organisation 
  which reached out to millions. </p>
<p> Srila Prabhupada was faced with a set of social circumstances that no <i>acarya</i> 
  before him had even dreamed of. He stuck rigidly to some principles and compromised 
  on others, all in a selfless effort to initiate, nurture and preserve the message 
  of Krsna in an atheistic world. His balance of 'purity is the force, utility 
  is the principle' succeeded. </p>
<p> Yet even during the twelve short years Srila Prabhupada was with us, ISKCON 
  and its missionary activities grew in complexity and diversity under his guidance. 
  Success led to growth, growth led to change. From the moment he announced to 
  the bewildered boys and girls in New York that he was going to San Francisco 
  (they couldn't see any good reason why he should ever leave New York), Srila 
  Prabhupada was introducing changes which would enable his young movement to 
  blossom. </p>
<p>  Are there circumstances in 1995 which suggest a need for new approaches 
  in the missionary style of the Hare Krsna movement? Has our success, notably 
  in literature sales and subsequent public interest, brought about developments 
  which we, as a dynamic movement, would do well to admit? Should that success 
  help us to plan for the future? I think so. Perhaps I can illustrate my point 
  better by revealing to you some of our observations, deliberations and innovations 
  in the UK over the past year. </p>
<p> First, some facts: in the UK there are at least one hundred towns and cities 
  with a population of 100,000 or more. Each of those centres has had regular 
  visits by book distributors over the years. To be specific, nineteen million 
  books have been sold in one hundred towns over a period of twenty years. That's 
  a considerable number of books per town. As one might expect, many people have 
  read those books and become interested in Krsna consciousness. Some joined a 
  temple or <i>ashram,</i> the majority didn't. Even without a national plan, 
  some thirty-one Nama Hatta groups have arisen. This figure does not include 
  ISKCON temples, small centres or <i>brahmacari sankirtan </i>houses. The fact 
  that thirty-one groups with an average of ten affiliated members have each developed 
  with almost no structured planning, indicates that the remaining seventy towns 
  might also yield groups of interested people with a minimal effort on our part. 
  Faced then with the realistic prospect of having one hundred flourishing devotee 
  groups by the end of the century, how should we prepare ourselves? What should 
  be our strategy? Do we have any responsibility to the two thousand congregational 
  members which our book distribution has created? Will those groups of devotees 
  be seen as 'ISKCON'? How should we train our present temple devotees so that 
  they can be effective communicators of Krsna consciousness? How will our organisational 
  structure have to change in order to accommodate our increased membership? </p>
<p> It was decided the best idea would be to ask the present members themselves.  
  In February this year we organised a Nama Hatta convention to which seventy 
  delegates came from the various groups around the country. Between them they 
  represented the hopes, wishes and suggestions of around six hundred new Vaisnavas, 
  the very fruit of our preaching. </p>
<p> They were broken into groups in order to discuss several important topics. 
  The first concerned personal spiritual growth: did they feel themselves advancing? 
  If so, what was helping them most? What were the obstacles and how could they 
  be overcome? How could ISKCON offer more assistance? The second series of questions 
  related to the experiences of working with others in a group: What were the 
  challenges to healthy growth? Were they happy with their meetings? What help 
  did they need? The final discussion centred on sharing their spiritual understanding 
  with others: did they talk to others in their town about Krsna? Did they sell 
  books? How successful were their efforts? What could ISKCON provide to make 
  their preaching more effective and enjoyable? </p>
<p> It was hoped this feedback would enable us to understand the Hare Krsna 
  movement from the point of view of its newest members. It would provide information 
  on gaps in our current procedures and give direction in forming organisational 
  policies regarding future effectiveness and overall success. The conclusions 
  of our members at the convention was, although predictable, quite surprising 
  in its unanimity. Everyone agreed on what they'd like to see happening in the 
  movement, what was needed to increase their own faith, knowledge and practice, 
  and how they could play their own part in its development. </p>
<p> In the area of personal spiritual development, all the delegates expressed 
  their satisfaction at having come to Krsna consciousness, but said that their 
  growth was often severely challenged when family, friends or colleagues were 
  intolerant of their new found lifestyle. This was particularly exacerbated when 
  there was a geographical remoteness from anyone else who was into Krsna consciousness. 
  Many interesting comments came up in the discussions, especially concerning 
  the need for personal guidance: 'I want to see a red dot on my spiritual map 
  - you are here - that's what I need. Someone to help me understand where I am 
  and where I've got to go to.' The overwhelming request was for senior devotees 
  and preachers to come and offer support, guidance and instruction. Although 
  many of the delegates had reached a point where they saw themselves eventually 
  taking initiation, many of them expressed a preference for a senior preacher 
  whom they could have greater access to and regular association with. Others 
  expressed the view that although they were as yet unready for the major commitment 
  of initiation, they nevertheless required a spiritual guide in their lives: 
  'I don't want a guru yet - I'm not ready for it - I know that. Just someone 
  to be my spiritual mentor and keep in regular communication with me.' Some delegates 
  expressed the value of developing firm friendships with other devotees and being 
  able to share a certain intimacy with them regarding their own spiritual progress. 
  The necessity for discussing philosophical doubts also came up. Many members 
  told of how their own personal growth had been very much helped by coming into 
  regular contact with others who were ready to talk about their own doubts and 
  struggles. Indeed, Nama Hatta groups themselves have often grown out of such 
  open, honest and friendly discussions. Some groups asked for a list of preachers 
  who would be willing to come and speak to them, offering to help with travelling 
  costs and accommodation. </p>
<p> Others called for a formulated curriculum of study so that their philosophical 
  training could be more structured. Still others wanted spiritual retreats or 
  summer camps in the country. When asked about the productiveness of meeting 
  together as a group, some expressed the difficulties they were having over various 
  conflicts that took place between members. Common causes were different styles 
  of leadership / followership, diverse personal and social backgrounds or different 
  viewpoints and philosophical understanding. Some felt that the regular visiting 
  preachers were exhorting them to a standard of practice that was far in excess 
  of what they were presently capable: 'It's especially difficult when it comes 
  to things like spiritual standards, our inability to keep up certain of the 
  regulative principles, dietary requirements, number of rounds, reading.' Others 
  considered that within the group there was an atmosphere in which they felt 
  an inability to express their own philosophical doubts without 'being made to 
  feel foolish'. But if tactless preachers were a problem, so too was the total 
  absence of visiting preachers. The lack of regular input from mature, educated 
  devotees resulted in 'laziness, lack of inspiration', and a 'need for further 
  guidance on the details of devotional service'. </p>
<p> Questions were also raised about where the Nama Hatta groups fitted into 
  the overall structure of ISKCON. What were their rights and privileges, and 
  their commensurate responsibilities? Should they be doing more for ISKCON or 
  should ISKCON be doing more for them? Others wanted to see a national department 
  within the movement specifically catering for their very real and ongoing needs. 
</p>
<p> When it was time to examine the group's outreach in their home town, most 
  delegates said they needed considerable advice and inspiration in order to accomplish 
  anything like the things that temple devotees considered an everyday affair. 
  'We need guidelines on how to answer the common questions which people ask us. 
  Perhaps we can have a small book on how to answer questions;' 'ISKCON should 
  publish a guide on how to preach. We also need more simple introductory literature 
  like pamphlets and leaflets.' One group came up with the suggestion regarding 
  inter-group communication so that new groups could learn from more experienced 
  ones how everything was to be done.</p>
<p> Based upon the many helpful suggestions made at the convention, and taking 
  those as an indication of future trends, devotees in the UK have begun, if somewhat 
  falteringly, to adjust their understanding of the movement's developmental strategy. 
  We've implemented some ideas and hope to have many new developments in place 
  by 1996. With considerable caution, and at the risk of being seen as an iconoclast, 
  I would like to put forward the following suggestions for ISKCON leaders and 
  preachers.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Vision</p>
<p>(1)        Book distribution should be seen as a means to an end, and not as 
  an end in itself. 'Distribute books and everything will come' should remain 
  our motto, but when 'everything' does come in the form of enthusiastic new members, 
  then at least some of us will have to care for them. Training devotees to fully 
  participate in this next stage of ISKCON's growth should begin now.</p>
<p>(2)        After awakening their dormant interest in Krsna by reading Srila 
  Prabhupada's books, most people want to talk to devotees, the living examples 
  of <i>bhakti-yoga </i>in action.</p>
<p>(3)        However, we are no longer the only movement which talks of the <i>Vedas, 
  bhakti, </i>reincarnation, karma, mantra meditation and Krsna. There are even 
  many other organisations who chant Hare Krsna. If we ourselves do not respond 
  to the success of our own book distribution, then other groups will. They already 
  compliment us by saying, 'ISKCON is very good at making members for us'.</p>
<p>(4)        Young people no longer become hippies and 'drop out' as they did 
  in the early years when they were 'our best customers'. Two decades of cults 
  and pseudo religions has bred a healthy cynicism in people. Even for those who 
  are seriously interested in spiritual matters, joining a religious community 
  is merely one of many current options. Much more convenient alternatives are 
  available in towns and cities everywhere.</p>
<p>(5)        Therefore, at this important stage in its growth, ISKCON needs grass-roots 
  support. If not a temple in every town and village, then at least one friend 
  who can act as an information centre for others to contact. In this way the 
  Hare Krsna movement will develop a 'local face'.</p>
<p>(6)        Local contacts networking together could form the supportive basis 
  of the activities ISKCON wishes to instigate. By effective ministry and organisation, 
  ISKCON's preachers could help many hundreds of such local contacts and groups.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Strategy </p>
<p>(1)        A congregational development policy should be discussed and all 
  devotees in the temples made aware of the part they can play. For example, book 
  distributors can collect names of the most interested people they meet and some 
  funds can be set aside to establish ongoing communication with these people</p>
<p>(2)        An enterprising householder can establish a mail-order system supplying 
  things such as books, tapes, etc. If possible, a National Congregational Development 
  Office should be set up to co-ordinate the <i>yatra's </i>policy.</p>
<p>(3)        As it develops, the Congregational Development Office can be funded 
  by the congregation itself.</p>
<p>(4)        A newsletter conveying both temple news and activities in the groups 
  can be published. The aim is to encourage members who practice Krsna consciousness 
  in isolation.</p>
<p>(5)        Keep a list of contacts or groups in every town. Give copies to 
  <i>sankirtan</i> devotees and temple leaders. Explain how widespread an influence 
  their <i>sankirtan</i> activities have already had. Only when devotees come 
  to understand that these people are the results of all their prayers and physical 
  efforts will they begin to see that the movement we refer to as ISKCON extends 
  far beyond their own temple.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Personal Growth</p>
<p>(1)        Encourage experienced devotees to see themselves as teachers, and 
  thus the need to take a few new devotees under their wing. Travelling may be 
  necessary.</p>
<p>(2)        Hold meetings with these preachers so that they can discuss the 
  best way to help others progress from one level of practice to the next.</p>
<p>(3)        Print a list of the preachers with telephone numbers and make it 
  available to new members and groups.</p>
<p>(4)        Try to arrange for members to meet up at conventions, festivals, 
  retreats, weekends or summer camps.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Groups</p>
<p>(1)        Write some basic guidelines for groups. These should be based on 
  the genuine experiences of older groups. They should include descriptions of 
  <i>sadhana</i> items like <i>japa, kirtan, </i>how to give a class and offer 
  <i>arati, </i>standards for cooking <i>prasadam</i> and so on. The guidelines 
  can include the real comments of congregational members themselves and not merely 
  scriptural quotations.</p>
<p>(2)        Preachers should ensure group members are aware of the four stages 
  of group development (see <i>ISKCON Communications Journal</i>, Issue 3) and 
  should encourage healthy relationships amongst members.</p>
<p>(3)        Groups should be aware that there are other groups exactly like 
  them. They should be able to see where they fit into the national ISKCON structure. 
  They should be aware of their rights and privileges as members of ISKCON and 
  of their responsibilities to the movement.</p>
<p>(4)        Groups should be aware of resources and facilities open to them 
  and whom to contact to obtain these.</p>
<p class="maintextsubhead">Sharing</p>
<p>(1)        Devotees involved in congregational development should see it as 
  their duty to train and support their members in preaching activities. Book 
  distribution, <i>harinama, </i>New-age fairs, festivals and <i>prasadam</i> 
  distribution are all opportunities for new members to share their enthusiasm 
  with others.</p>
<p>(2)        Information pamphlets on how to sell books and answer common questions 
  can be prepared. Leaflets with introductory information on reincarnation, mantra 
  meditation, etc. can be printed up in large quantities for distribution by members.</p>
<p>(3)        Work out a system with the local BBT or temple for groups to have 
  access to books for distribution and to arrange for any funds raised to be properly 
  accounted. All the above activities can be recorded and communicated to devotees 
  nationally so that an awareness of congregation development is fostered within 
  the <i>yatra.</i> </p>
<p>By following these suggestions, we will be able to come several steps closer 
  to fulfilling Lord Caitanya's prophecy: 'My name will be heard in every town 
  and village'.</p>
