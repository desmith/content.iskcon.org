            <p class="maintextsubhead">Edited by Massimo Introvigne on behalf of CESNUR (Centre Study 
              of New Religions)<br>
              Publisher: Effedieffe (Milan)<br>
              First published 1993<br>
              ISBN 88-85223-08-7</p>
            <p>The idea inspiring this piece of research is the continually increasing 
              number of people who believe in reincarnation. Concerned by statistics 
              showing how developed the belief in reincarnation is (one in five 
              Europeans consider reincarnation as being possible), CESNUR recruited 
              a group of academics to study and analyse this phenomena from various 
              angles. </p>
            <p> The book itself is divided into five sections, each part written 
              by a different scholar with expertise in a particular subject. In 
              his Introduction, Massimo Introvigne describes the historical development 
              in Europe of belief in reincarnation, specifically highlighting 
              the Western approach and how the model of reincarnation has been 
              subject to different transformations over the years. In the second 
              section, Fr. Gaetano Favaro attempts to show how this belief has 
              its roots in the Orient, by suggesting reincarnation is not present 
              in the ancient Hindu scriptures. However, he does not appear to 
              have found any strong or valid arguments to support this theory, 
              relying instead on decontextualising various passages from the <i>Brahmana</i> 
              and the <i>Upanisads.</i> He also cites the results of a recent 
              Italian survey showing the large percentage of young boys who believe 
              in reincarnation. </p>
            <p> In the third section, Fr. Ernesto Zucchini describes three main 
              groups working to spread the theory of reincarnation: ISKCON, Universal 
              Life and Sukhyo Mahikari. I feel this particular section aptly demonstrates 
              the need for devotees to follow-up on the millions of books they 
              have distributed and to establish a system to help people understand 
              the message of Srila Prabhupada and the <i>Vedas.</i> Zucchini quotes 
              more than twenty passages from Prabhupada's books, but the resulting 
              impression that he leaves the reader with is not at all favourable. 
            </p>
            <p> Prof. Ermanno Pavesi, in the fourth section, attempts to counteract 
              the large body of scientific evidence put forward to sustain the 
              reincarnation model. His essay is not very comprehensive nor analytical, 
              but merely presents a brief summary of the various concepts. </p>
            <p> The final section of the volume is dedicated to a theological 
              essay compiled by a Christian theologian, Piero Cantoni, who employs 
              a critical interpretation of the different academic theories put 
              forward in order to render belief in reincarnation compatible with 
              Christian dogma. It is an interesting work compiled with great ability 
              and a broad vision of the subject. </p>
            <p> However, it appears that the underlying agenda of this essay is 
              to emphasise the flaws in the transmigration theory, and to suggest 
              ways of dealing with its proponents. Cantoni also discusses how 
              the theory of reincarnation was not present in ancient Indian scriptures 
              such as the <i>Rg, Yajur </i>and <i>Sama Vedas.</i> His approach 
              is ultimately superficial and not seriously researched. He concludes 
              very simply that reincarnation should be looked upon as a recently 
              discovered theory, frequently using the term 'new thesis' in his 
              own dissertation.</p>
            <p> In conclusion, this book constitutes a valuable instrument in 
              that it highlights the various qualifications and skills that devotees 
              must develop in order to present ISKCON's philosophy in a sharper, 
              more dynamic way. If we do not adopt a more intellectual approach 
              to presenting this information, people will continue to be confused 
              by subjective opposing views such as those presented in this book 
              that, because of their prominence, will ultimately be taken more 
              seriously. Although I do not feel the book's contributors present 
              very strong arguments against the concept of reincarnation, they 
              are efficacious in demonstrating how hard we have to work in order 
              to present reincarnation and other Krsna conscious concepts to the 
              general public in a more acceptable form. </p>
