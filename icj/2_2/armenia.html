            <p align=left><b>Introduction<br>
              </b> The following is a report prepared by ISKCON Communications 
              Europe on the persecution of Hare Krishna members in Armenia. This 
              case has been taken up by Amnesty International and a report on 
              the following events has been prepared by the US embassy in Yeravan, 
              which will be included in the US Department of State's 1995 Human 
              Rights Report on Armenia. The Swedish Foreign Office will also include 
              this case in their 1995 report. The case has also been reported 
              to the Office for International Human Rights of the CSCE. A letter 
              writing campaign directed at the President of Armenia was begun 
              in September of this year and demonstrations have taken place at 
              various Armenian embassies around the world. 
            <p><b>History<br>
              </b>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON 
              or the Hare Krishna Movement) was introduced to Armenia in 1981. 
              Within a few years a group of some thirty to forty followers formed 
              an association for the practice of their religion in the capital 
              of Armenia, Yerevan. 
            <p>During the Soviet regime in Armenia, members of ISKCON lived under 
              the constant supervision of the KGB, in hiding, on the run and later 
              in prison and mental institutions. 
            <p>In 1985 and in 1986 the KGB orchestrated two court cases against 
              members of the society. As a result of these two cases eleven Hare 
              Krishnas' were imprisoned in State prisons, labour camps and psychiatric 
              hospitals. Among them were Karen Saakyan, Armen Saakyan, Suren Karapetyan, 
              Sarkis Ogandzhanyan, Gagik Buniatyan, Agvan Arytyunyan, Armine Hrtyan, 
              Ara Akopyan and Armen Sarkisyan. 
            <p>One of those imprisoned that time, Sarkis Ogandzhanyan (23 yrs. 
              of age), died on December 27th. 1987, from tuberculosis and malnutrition 
              in labour camp YU-25/&quot;B&quot; situated in the Orenburg Territory 
              of the Russian Republic. He had entered the camp as a perfectly 
              healthy young man and he was due to have been released in January 
              1988. 
            <p>Another member, Martik Zhamkochyan (25 yrs. of age), died in a 
              psychiatric hospital in the Sovetashen District of Yerevan in July 
              1986. In the psychiatric hospital he was force-fed with raw eggs, 
              which were administered through a tube and he was simultaneously 
              injected with large doses of psycho-pharmacological drugs. After 
              several days of such &quot;treatment&quot; he died. 
            <p>In 1985, in Sweden the Committee to Free Soviet Hare Krishnas was 
              formed. The Committee publicised the violations against civil, religious 
              and human rights surrounding the persecution of the Soviet Hare 
              Krishnas. Many human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, 
              Helsinki Watch, International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights 
              and The Committee for Human Rights in Eastern Europe took part in 
              the campaign to free the Soviet Hare Krishnas. Due to the efforts 
              of the Committee and world-wide support for the campaign most of 
              the Hare Krishna members imprisoned were released between 1987-1988. 
            <p>In 1989-90 the proposed transition to a more democratic society 
              promised hope for religious freedom. In 1990 ISKCON was, for the 
              first time, officially registered as a religion in Armenia. There 
              are now about 250 ISKCON members resident in Armenia and ISKCON 
              maintains congregations in the towns of Gyumri, Kirovakan, Eghnadzor, 
              Kapan and Ashtarak. 
            <p><b>Social contribution<br>
              </b>Even before the official registration, ISKCON had started various 
              religious and missionary programmes which included Hare Krishna 
              Food for Life, a humanitarian food distribution programme for the 
              needy. In December 1988, three days after a devastating earthquake 
              in Leninakan (now Gyumri) a group of thirty Hare Krishna members 
              (both from Russia and Armenia) went to Leninakan and started free 
              food distribution. The money for the programme was collected internationally. 
              For about five months 1000 free meals were distributed daily to 
              the victims of the earthquake. 
            <p>Unfortunately the threat of religious tolerance was short-lived. 
              Despite attempts by ISKCON members to make a positive social contribution 
              and to live in peaceful co-existence with other religious communities; 
              our members in Armenia have noted an increase in animosity towards 
              them which seemed to parallel an increase of nationalism and a revival 
              of traditional religions. ISKCON's charitable activities have recently 
              been prohibited by a direct order from Mr. Khachik Stamboltsian, 
              chairman of the Supreme Council Commission on Refugees and Emergencies. 
            <p>In spite of the restrictions on ISKCON's free food distribution 
              programme, ISKCON members continue to distribute 1,000 free meals 
              each day in Armenia, especially in hospitals. 
            <p><b>Recent problems in Armenia<br>
              </b>Below we chronologically document the more recent development 
              of systematic harassment of Hare Krishna members, by priests of 
              the majority Armenian Apostolic church, police and local government 
              officials. 
            <p>On July 10th., 1992 the Hare Krishna temple in Yerevan was attacked 
              by arsonists. Temple members managed to extinguish the fire which 
              damaged the temple building and two cars owned by ISKCON. ISKCON 
              appealed to the Commission for Human Rights of the Supreme Council 
              of Armenia and local police, but the complaint was ignored. 
            <p>In June 1993 a few members of the Society went to the Republic 
              of Nagorny Karabakh to open a free food distribution centre for 
              local people. On June 12th. ISKCON members and Mr. L. Gulyan, the 
              Head of the Department of Refugees and Humanitarian Aid reached 
              an agreement to co-operate together in order to help the region's 
              under-privileged. Mr. Gulyan promised to provide ISKCON with premises 
              for their free food distribution in Stepanakert city and other settlements 
              in the R.N.K. In Stepanakert ISKCON was granted facility to distribute 
              free food on the premises of a former restaurant. Within a month 
              of the programme starting, a group of armed men broke into the premises 
              and demanded, on behalf of the government, that our members leave 
              the country within 24 hours. ISKCON's members appealed to the State 
              Minister Zirair Pogosyan, who refused to help and actually declared 
              to support the demands of the intruders. 
            <p>On September 23 1993 Mikhael Unjugulyan, a Krishna devotee, was 
              severely beaten before the inhabitants in his village of origin, 
              Oshakan. His assailant was a priest from the local Armenian Orthodox 
              Church, a Father Gevork. A vain appeal for justice was made by the 
              victim to the police in the Ashtrak region. His complaint was ignored. 
              The incident was witnessed and can be verified by many inhabitants 
              of the village. 
            <p>In April 1994, thirty tons of religious books were dispatched from 
              ISKCON in Moscow for the temple in Yerevan. The books were seized 
              by the customs at Masis station before they reached Yerevan. Despite 
              many appeals to the Council for Religion Affairs which is supposed 
              to give permission to receive religious literature, the books are 
              still being detained by customs at Masis station. Initially the 
              Council for Religious Affairs instructed the customs station not 
              to release the books but later claim to have written to ask them 
              to release the books. ISKCON has not received any of the books nor 
              have members been informed as to the location of their literature. 
              It should be noted that religious books do not require customs clearance 
              in order to be imported into Armenia. 
            <p>On April 18, 1994 Hare Krishna member Artur Khachatryan was attacked 
              by a group of fifteen members of the Armenian Army in an Officer's 
              Club in Yerevan. He was severely beaten and had to be hospitalised. 
              The religious books he carried with him were burned. The case was 
              reported to the police station in the Spandaryan district of Yerevan. 
              The appointed police investigator was a Captain Asatryan who decided 
              not to question or arrest the offenders, although their names are 
              known to the police. 
            <p>On July 4, 1994 two female members of the Hare Krishna Society 
              in Yerevan, Anaite Arzumanian and Mariana Dorunz, travelled to the 
              neighbouring town of Sisyan, to distribute religious literature 
              and minister to local sympathisers. They were intercepted on route 
              by two priests of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Father Narek from 
              Sisyan and an American priest of the Avat Mission (a branch of the 
              Armenian Apostolic church), Father Zenob. Supported by soldiers 
              of the Armenian army, the priests confiscated more than 150 books 
              and proceeded to light a bonfire with them, an act which attracted 
              much local attention. The priests and their supporters then forcibly 
              ripped the clothing off the women, twisted their arms, tore their 
              religious neckbeads off their necks and threw these articles into 
              the bonfire. This scene was witnessed by many of the local people. 
              This incident was reported to Mr. Robert Patterson of the American 
              embassy in Armenia, and to the special correspondent of Espress-chronika 
              in Armenia, Michail Dabasyan. 
            <p>Krishna devotees appealed for justice in these cases to the Armenian 
              Prosecutor and the Committee for Human Rights at the Armenian Supreme 
              Soviet. The only response came from an investigator, Mr Kroyan, 
              which consisted only of a threatening commitment to investigate 
              all Hare Krishna activities in Armenia. 
            <p>On July 26, 1994 another ISKCON member Karo Mkrtchyan was seriously 
              beaten and threatened with murder by six members of the Dashnaktzusyun 
              Party (a nationalist political party). Again any religious books 
              or paraphernalia he carried were confiscated. He was also told that 
              if he was seen again in the city after twenty four hours, he would 
              be killed on the spot. On July 31, 1994 in the town of Goris a live 
              phone-in interview with the Patriarch of the South Armenian region, 
              Bishop Abraham was broadcast on the local state cable television. 
              During the interview a question was raised about the status of ISKCON. 
              The bishop replied that it was all the work of Satan and that the 
              books sold by ISKCON represent a real social danger, diverting people 
              from the path of God. He claimed to have formed a committee, in 
              the local Cultural House for Youth with the aim of collecting all 
              the ISKCON books from the population in exchange for free Bibles 
              (this facility was also announced on local radio). He promised to 
              publicly burn the collected literature. 
            <p>On August 28th. ten armed thugs stormed the Hare Krishna Temple 
              in Yerevan. They completely vandalised the place of worship, desecrated 
              the altar, and severely assaulted the temple President, Ivan Dallakyan. 
              The attack lasted more than twenty minutes. During the attack ISKCON 
              members tried to report the attack to the police who only sent a 
              police patrol to the scene after four attempts at trying to contact 
              them. The police car only stayed long enough for the police officer 
              to declare, &quot;We are not going to protect people like you.&quot; 
              After the incident, Ivan Dallakyan himself called the police and 
              asked for protection. He gave the police the names and addresses 
              of the people who attacked the temple; but again, there was no sign 
              of response from the police. 
            <p>On the morning of August 31st, the same people phoned and warned 
              that they would come again at 19.00 hours. Temple members called 
              the police at 17.00 hours and requested protection. A police patrol 
              arrived after a short time and stayed only fifteen minutes, explaining 
              that they had no time to wait. At the appointed time four people 
              arrived at the temple. They started to abuse the temple residents 
              and threatened violence. Before long a scuffle ensued and suddenly, 
              after just a few moments, a fleet of fourteen police cars appeared 
              on the scene. The policemen surrounded the temple and arrested all 
              the residents. Seventeen Hare Krishna members were taken into custody. 
              In the police station the prisoners were abused and beaten. 
            <p>Subsequently sixteen of those arrested have been freed from the 
              state prison. They are, nonetheless, being forced to stay under 
              house arrest for an unspecified investigation period. 
            <p>As a result of the attack on the temple one Hare Krishna member, 
              Boris Agagabyan, was hospitalised with head injuries and a severely 
              damaged nose. Another member, Mkrtchyan Karo has suffered severe 
              head injuries, inflicted by a metal bar. Others also had to receive 
              hospital treatment. 
            <p>On the 3rd. September a member called Grigoryan Kamo was arrested 
              by the local police and taken into custody. During the night he 
              was badly beaten in his cell by the same policemen who had beaten 
              the others on the 31st. On the 6th. September Grigoryan Kamo was 
              transferred to a psychiatric prison hospital. 
            <p><b>Media incitement<br>
              </b>A mass media campaign has been orchestrated against ISKCON in 
              the last six months of 1994. The reportage is sensationalistic and 
              sectarian. When Ara Akopyan (an ISKCON member) asked Voskan Maminonyan, 
              a correspondent from the Erkir newspaper, why he published blatant 
              lies about ISKCON, the correspondent replied, 'When a war is being 
              fought against a political enemy, then all means are to be used, 
              both honest and dishonest.' 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>At the time of publication the whereabouts of the confiscated 
              books is still unknown and fourteen ISKCON members are still undergoing 
              investigation, with the constant threat of court action. Since the 
              beginning of the International campaign things have certainly quietened 
              down in Armenia, illustrating how effective outside pressure can 
              be, but the threat to ISKCON members rights and freedom is still 
              as real as ever. 
            <p>The immediate aim of the campaign is to see the return of the literature 
              to ISKCON and the dropping of charges of incitement against ISKCON 
              members. Eventually we would hope to see a change in the laws governing 
              the registration of religion in Armenia, a change which reflects 
              a just and non-sectarian approach to religion and worship. 
            <p><b>Update: March 1995<br>
              </b>After various attempts to secure possession of the confiscated 
              books ISKCON members heard from reliable political sources that 
              the literatures had been burned. Further information suggested that 
              the order to burn the books came from the head of the Armenian KGB, 
              David Shahnazarian. They were reportedly burnt in the ovens of the 
              Thermal power plant in Yerevan, mixed with liquid fuel. Informants 
              claim that this was done in reply to the international reaction 
              to the reported persecution of Hare Krishna members in Armenia. 
            <p>On the 16th. March 1995 a committee was formed comprising of the 
              president of ISKCON in Armenia, a representative of the US Embassy 
              in Armenia, the head of Customs, the head of the local station police 
              and the head of the railway station where the books were held. This 
              committee proceeded to unlock the container of books. The container 
              was opened and it was found to be empty. ISKCON in Armenia has lodged 
              an official complaint regarding this but has been advised that it 
              may not be wise to pursue the case seriously.
