            <p align=LEFT><i>My experience working in and with organisations convinces 
              me that the greatest skill required in senior managers is that of 
              delegation, since it is the process of defining tasks and roles 
              which lays the basis for effective teamwork. Even in small organisations, 
              like families, there is a need for members to know who is responsible 
              for what, and in large organisations the greater size makes it essential 
              that complex process are broken down into manageable tasks which 
              are entrusted to individual members. Yet, this process of delegation 
              is often neglected, so that there is role confusion and overlap 
              which lead to inefficient use of manpower and to conflict between 
              members. The purpose of this article is to suggest ways in which 
              such problems can be avoided.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Why Delegate?<br>
              </b>Despite some managers' wish to control all aspects of management, 
              organisations cannot be the responsibility of one person. <i>Responsibility 
              means making decisions for which one accepts the consequences</i>, 
              and it is not possible for one person to make all the decisions 
              for everything that is happening during the complex activity of 
              an organisation, and so means have to be found for devolving its 
              multifarious tasks to all its members. 
            <p>We can illustrate the process involved by taking the example of 
              a large school, which we all have some experience of, in which the 
              headteacher is responsible for ensuring that the students obtain 
              a good education. She is <i>accountable</i> to the governors of 
              the school for this, and, in the event of anything untoward happening, 
              the governors will seek explanations from her. However, she cannot 
              personally perform all the functions necessary to ensure success, 
              since she cannot be in all the classrooms, etc., at the same time, 
              so she has to limit the responsibilities she can accept, e.g., she 
              may decide that her prime functions are for overall strategic planning, 
              for external liaison and for staff development. All other functions 
              she will give to her deputies. They in turn will determine what 
              is reasonable for them to do and give all other responsibilities 
              to heads of departments, and so on down the line until individual 
              teachers are responsible for delivering the curriculum to the students. 
              In this way, all the tasks needed to run the school are covered, 
              yet no member of staff has an unmanageable load of work. Also, the 
              headteacher has clear lines of accountability to herself from the 
              most junior members of staff through the various levels of seniority 
              , and in this way she can monitor how effectively the school is 
              functioning. 
            <p>The particular example used above, which is of a line-management 
              structure, is, of course, only one, though probably the most common, 
              way of structuring the division of responsibility; another very 
              common way uses a matrix structure. In this, a differentiation is 
              made between process functions which are cross-organisational, and 
              project functions which control production and which are concerned 
              with specific activities: in a school such a structure might result 
              in process managers for personnel, curriculum, pastoral care, physical 
              resources, etc., and project managers for the organisation of specific 
              subjects, like science, maths., etc. Whichever structure is used, 
              however, the principle of delegation remains the same, i.e., 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>responsibility is distributed from the most senior executive 
                to the remainder of the personnel, i.e., it is a top-down process.</li>
              <li>accountability for the decisions made is from the delegatee 
                to the delegator , i.e., it is a bottom-up process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to stress, at this point, that accountability can 
              never be delegated, i.e., the delegator remains the one who must 
              answer for actions taken, even by delegatees. This must mean that 
              the chief executive is always answerable for the actions of subordinates, 
              although he may not be responsible for them. It is extremely important, 
              therefore, that the delegation process is correctly implemented. 
            <p>The primary reason for delegating is, then, to ensure that all 
              essential tasks are allocated to individuals through manageable 
              structures, but there are other good reasons for devolving responsibility, 
              e.g.: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>it allows the full creativity of all members to be used in the 
                best interests of the organisation, since everyone has a share 
                in decision-making. Good delegation means that everyone can contribute 
                to effective management; bad delegation may mean that everyone 
                is at the mercy of powerful incompetents. </li>
              <li>it encourages the development of expertise, since each person 
                can acquire the skills and knowledge required of a specialised 
                role. Nowadays, organisations must employ highly specialised staff 
                because of their increasingly complex needs, e.g., in many ISKCON 
                communities, the need for staff who are able to deal with government 
                or the local community in preserving freedom of worship. Without 
                delegation, it would be impossible for individuals to develop 
                such competence. </li>
              <li>it can ensure that the person best suited to a job has control 
                over it. Despite the beliefs of many senior managers, seniority 
                does not necessarily confer competence, and many junior staff 
                are better equipped than their superiors to fulfil some roles, 
                particularly those requiring knowledge and skills in technological 
                areas like computing. A wise manager is willing to acknowledge 
                the superior skills of subordinates and to give them responsibility 
                and authority in these fields. </li>
              <li>because it enables people to develop new skills and, therefore, 
                to fulfil increasingly responsible positions within the organisation, 
                it is an effective form of staff development: the best senior 
                managers ensure that there is always a pool of trained staff ready 
                for promotion, or, as one senior manager once told me, 'my main 
                function is to train my successor'.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the obvious advantages of delegation, however, my experience 
              is that it is rarely done effectively, and a major reason is fear 
              on the part of superordinates: fear of losing power and control 
              to subordinates, fear of being seen to be redundant, fear of losing 
              status, fear of being seen to be less expert in some fields than 
              their subordinates, etc. Unwillingness to delegate has serious consequences 
              which can be seen in many organisations, e.g., 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>high levels of managerial stress from attempting to do everything 
                oneself. Stress is now a major problem in many organisations, 
                resulting in inefficiency, illness and poor use of resources. 
                Failure to distribute work through delegation leads to overload 
                on senior staff, who are usually the very ones who need to be 
                fit to meet the challenges of modern management. However, it is 
                essential that managers should not see delegation as a means of 
                offloading their stress on to others! </li>
              <li>demotivated staff, who have little of the challenge that derives 
                from responsibility. Since they cannot contribute to successful 
                decision-making, they will cease to care, and may even oppose 
                or sabotage decisions imposed upon them. Apathy is a sure sign 
                of poor delegation. </li>
              <li>role overlap and confusion, leading to the hostility which emanates 
                from interference in one's work-the 'looking-over-shoulders' climate 
                of some organisations. A great deal of the conflict evident in 
                organisations derives from this lack of clarity over who does 
                what. </li>
              <li>some work is not the responsibility of anyone in particular, 
                which means that decisions are just not made; this is a particularly 
                serious drawback in crisis situations, where decisions need to 
                be made quickly and with confidence.</li>
              <ul>
                <p> 
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>An effective and happy organisation requires people to feel that 
              they have a clear-cut and important role to play in organisational 
              success, and delegation allows this to happen. 
            <p><b>What and How to Delegate<br>
              </b>Any part of a manager's work can be delegated, from a major 
              area of concern, which is delegated as a job description, to a small 
              task requiring little time and few resources. However small the 
              task, however, the delegation process is the same. It entails defining: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>the task,</li>
              <li>the accountability required of the delegatee,</li>
              <li> the responsibilities being given to the delegatee,</li>
              <li> the authority which is awarded to the delegatee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>THE TASK.</b> Whether the delegated task is a short-term minor 
              piece of work or a major part of the delegator's job, it must be 
              worthwhile, i.e., it must contribute in a clearly visible way to 
              the success of the organisation. Good organisations define their 
              mission clearly, ensuring that all members share its values and 
              objectives; they then determine all the tasks which need to be done 
              in order to achieve it and these tasks are given to the most suitable 
              members. Unless there is this clear definition of the task, and 
              the delegatee fully understands its importance, there cannot be 
              the commitment necessary to success. Some features of good task 
              definition are : 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>clearly defined outcomes, e.g., ' the work will produce a clear 
                statement of policy regarding recruitment ', </li>
              <li>clear indication of the time frame, e.g., 'the report will be 
                produced by December 31', </li>
              <li>a statement of the monitoring procedures to be used, e.g., 'review 
                meetings will be held on the first Monday of each month until 
                completion', </li>
              <li>a definition of the use to be made of the product, e.g., 'the 
                report will be submitted to the Management Board for its approval'. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>ACCOUNTABILITY.</b> A delegated task represents part of the 
              delegator's job which she would otherwise do and, since she remains 
              answerable to her superiors for its success or failure it is necessary 
              for her to know how well that work is being done. A wise delegator 
              will therefore ensure that the task parameters are carefully defined, 
              so that the delegatee cannot unilaterally make decisions which prejudice 
              a successful outcome, and that there is periodic monitoring to ensure 
              that the work is being carried out in the agreed fashion. It may 
              be that this monitoring can also be delegated, e.g., the delegatee 
              may be required to produce regular reports to a committee, but the 
              delegator needs to keep contact with the progress of the work, so 
              that she can answer for it to her superiors. 
            <p><b>RESPONSIBILITY.</b> Delegation implies giving to the delegatee 
              the power to make all the decisions needed for success. Since the 
              delegator remains accountable for the outcomes of the task, it is 
              very important that the boundaries of responsibility are clearly 
              defined, but once this has been done, the delegatee should be allowed 
              to do the work without any interference. Far too often, the delegator 
              is unable to do this, and friction arises, leading to: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>demotivation of staff, who complain that they are not allowed 
                to do anything without supervision and interference, </li>
              <li>lack of learning opportunities for staff, since they are unable 
                to make their own mistakes and to learn from them, </li>
              <li>a reluctance on the part of staff to undertake additional tasks 
                because they are a source of discontent. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In delegating a task, therefore, it is important to make absolutely 
              clear: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li> the policy framework within which the task is being delegated, 
              </li>
              <li>the precise outcomes required (see above), </li>
              <li>how far the delegatee can interpret events and how far they 
                must conform to set rules, </li>
              <li>what circumstances would require reference to a superior for 
                authorisation, </li>
              <li>what form the accountability monitoring will take.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Authority<br>
              </b>Since, when you delegate a task, you are asking someone else 
              to do your work for you, it is only fair that they should also be 
              given the resources you would have to do it. This transfer of resources 
              is called authority. Probably the most frequent complaint made against 
              managers is that they give responsibility without authority, i.e., 
              they require a subordinate to undertake a task without transferring 
              the means to succeed. In order to delegate effectively, therefore, 
              it is critical that you should transfer to the delegatee: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>the financial resources needed. A major task should carry its 
                own budget, therefore, and the delegatee should have the power 
                to spend money as required by the task, without constant reference 
                to a superior. Since accountability remains with the superior, 
                however, it may be necessary to have periodic reviews of the financial 
                situation to ensure that the terms of the authorisation are being 
                met; this can be achieved by a requirement to submit accounts 
                on a regular basis. </li>
              <li>the material resources needed, e.g., materials, accommodation, 
                technical aids. Clearly there are limits on availability, but 
                within these, the delegatee should have all the back-up which 
                would be available to the delegator is the task were not delegated. 
              </li>
              <li>technical support in the form of secretarial assistance, technical 
                services, etc. The degree to which these are available needs to 
                be clarified, e.g., the number of hours of secretarial help that 
                can be called upon, </li>
              <li>political power in the form of the authority to require other 
                personnel to participate in the task exactly as they would if 
                the delegator were to do it. This would enable the delegatee to 
                form committees, to run pilot projects, to delegate sub-tasks, 
                etc., and to represent the delegator to outside agencies. This 
                is probably the authority that most senior managers find difficulty 
                in delegating, and I am familiar with some who require all mail 
                to be signed personally, or to brief their delegatees on what 
                they are allowed to say at meetings with outside agencies; such 
                interference can only weaken the authority of the delegatee and 
                lead to conflict.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Following-Up a Delegated Task<br>
              </b>Good leaders use delegation as a means of developing their staff's 
              expertise, and an important element in this is the follow-up to 
              a completed task or the progress review of an ongoing one. In either 
              case, the delegatee is entitled to receive feedback from you in 
              the following ways: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>public acknowledgement of the work done. This can be in the 
                form of a statement to other colleagues through a staff bulletin 
                or by announcement at a staff meeting. </li>
              <li>personal thanks for having done your work for you. </li>
              <li>praise for aspects of the work which were particularly well 
                done. This is extremely important because of the motivation which 
                it creates, yet it is not often done. </li>
              <li>constructive feedback on aspects of the work which you, with 
                your greater experience, might have done differently. This is 
                not the same as criticism! It entails making suggestions about 
                how the work might be done differently if it were to be repeated 
                and allows time for discussion of any aspects of the work, so 
                that the delegatee might learn from the experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>An Example of a Delegated Role<br>
              </b>Below is an example of a job description, taken from a school 
              in Wales, which encapsulates the principles outlined above. How 
              many of your staff have such an explicit statement?
