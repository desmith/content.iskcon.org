            Author: Julius Lipner<br>
            ISBN: 0-415-05181-9 </span> 
            <p align=LEFT>&nbsp;The author himself describes the compilation of 
              this book as 'a Herculean task'. Anyone who has seriously studied 
              Hinduism (what to speak of trying to teach it!) will empathise. 
              This multi-faceted and amorphous subject stealthily defies all attempts 
              to tie it down, or capture it within a conceptual framework. Lipner's 
              opening chapter includes a comprehensive analysis of this problem 
              and he rightly observes that Hinduism, however defined, appears 
              to embrace the full gambit of philosophical and theological stances. 
              He also expresses his dilemma in trying to accommodate diversity 
              whilst attempting to make the whole picture 'hang together'. This 
              he does well, though from the Gaudiya Vaishnava perspective he fails 
              to quite grasp the essence (as we'll discuss later). 
            <p align=LEFT>Reading this book was refreshingly easy, though academically 
              challenging. My much-used dictionary failed on a number of occasions. 
              The style is lucid and varied, intertwining descriptive and philosophical 
              narrative with personal anecdotes, traditional stories (including 
              a prolonged version of the gambling match from the <i>Mahabharata</i>) 
              and a striking description of the Kumbha Mela festival (which, to 
              my mind, vividly contrasted our neatly ordered, monotone lives). 
              Disappointingly though, the text rarely confronts the predominating 
              Western world-view. The author, despite the claimed phenomenological 
              approach, often fails to suspend his own bias. Nor does he acknowledge 
              or reflect on his own subjectivity. Particularly evident is his 
              affinity for the reform movements (such as the Arya Samaj) and his 
              concommitant attitudes towards women and caste, by which I suspected 
              aversion to all types of hierarchism. I sensed also a heavy leaning 
              towards rationalism reflected in phrases such as 'even educated 
              Hindus' when discussing astrology, or, in the following excerpt, 
              'It is remarkable how deep-rooted the belief is, even among educated 
              people, that sexual activity results in the loss of spiritual and 
              even physical power to accomplish things'. This rather Darwinian 
              concept of validating and stratifying society according to degrees 
              of modernity and education may be expected from such an accomplished 
              scholar, as also his predilection for empiricism. When exploring 
              the history of Hinduism he comes up with the same old Aryan invasion 
              theories and the much-quoted 'fact' that Aryans ate beef! 
            <p align=LEFT>What really struck me, though, while reading the book, 
              was a certain ambivalence. At one point the author demonstrated 
              rare discretion in contending widely-held assumptions. In the next 
              sentence, I perceived his inability to grasp the real essence of 
              'Vedic' thought. 
            <p align=LEFT>This latter point became apparent in Chapter One where 
              he writes, '...the expression eternal (<i>sanatana</i>) <i>dharma</i> 
              seems to imply that Hinduism cannot or should not undergo change'. 
              An interesting point to explore, yet he seems to subsequently dismiss 
              the term omitting its etymological meaning. Ironically, when later 
              discussing the epithet 'Hindu', he quotes Kabir: 'Neither a Hindu 
              nor a Muslim am I' and again, '...Rama and Allah are One.' Here 
              he's touching on points quintessential to the notion of <i>sanatana-dharma</i> 
              (and not, may I add, just from the Gaudiya Vaishnava perspective) 
              and yet fails to recognise it. Later on he adds, 'I have yet to 
              discover a Hindu <i>sanatana-dharma</i> in the sense of some universally 
              recognised philosophy...' This statement is blatantly a truism! 
              Lipner continues by establishing a false dilemma, 'Thus <i>sanatana-dharma</i> 
              can properly only mean an ancient and continuing guideline for an 
              orientation in the world which may draw on the ancient codes of 
              <i>varnashrama dharma </i>...' This doesn't quite make it; not only 
              in failing to extend the time axis unlimitedly but to express the 
              ever-present, all-pervading and axiomatic nature of <i>sanatana-dharma.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>I felt the basis of Lipner's miscomprehension became 
              clear in the Ninth Chapter, where he discusses at length the doctrines 
              of rebirth and <i>karma.</i> His exposition is thorough and includes 
              an exploration of the free choice/ providence polemic. Towards the 
              end though, (page 246) he argues, '...in what sense may a particular 
              individual be said to be responsible for the past <i>karma</i> of 
              its karmic chain? ... For the ego of this life, which...is crucial 
              for the notion of moral accountability is not the ego of a previous 
              life, nor will it be the ego of a future existence.' And further, 
              'When no obviously rational explanation is available, fate/<i>karma</i> 
              steps in as the answer.' And he summarises, 'In short, the doctrine 
              of <i>karma</i> and rebirth, with or without the aegis of divine 
              providence, is a distinctive Hindu way of papering over the cracks 
              in a rationale appraisal of existence.' His is a sophisticated form 
              of the all-too-common argument that (this) religion is for those 
              who don't have scientific knowledge. To a Vaishnava it is clear 
              what is the root of Lipner's misconception, and indeed misrepresentation-his 
              failure to pick up on the nature of the true self (the true ego 
              as opposed to the false) which continues from body to body and therefore 
              is accountable. 
            <p align=LEFT>Upon reading this I was convinced of the author's leanings 
              towards Judaic-Christian doctrine as well as empiricism (although 
              I don't believe they're so much different). I must admit to feeling 
              the compulsion to launch into an offensive on the 'one-life-heaven-hell-paradigm' 
              with all <i>its</i> philosophical cracks and crevices. What I really 
              began to suspect is that equating the self with the body is the 
              root cause of a number of (hence) inter-related doctrines, including: 
              the concept of linear time/ the notion of unidirectional progress/ 
              exclusivity/ reliance on empiricism/ lack of concern for animals/ 
              fear or lack of appreciation of the subtle/ condemnation of asceticism, 
              etc. I was reminded of Arthur Schopenhauser's statement, 'Were an 
              Asiatic to ask me for a definition of Europe, I should be forced 
              to answer him: It is that part of the world which is haunted by 
              the incredible delusion that man was created out of nothing, and 
              that his present birth is his first entrance into life.' My conclusion: 
              Dr Lipner is very expert at 'licking the bottle of honey', but fails 
              to grasp the philosophical root of Vedic thought. 
            <p align=LEFT>Despite the book's shortcomings (found in many similar 
              texts) it has some outstanding features (which are, I suspect, far 
              less common). Of relevance to devotees is an enlightening discussion 
              on the relationship between <i>sruti</i> and <i>smriti</i> with 
              particular reference to Ballabha 'dissolving the distinction' and 
              'enlarging the concept of <i>Veda</i>' (page 61). Lipner's treatment 
              of the guru-disciple relationship is equally sensitive. He writes, 
              'but subservience did not mean servility, as it often seems to in 
              the modern context.' He also dispels the notions that Hinduism is 
              totally fatalistic (as its opponents often claim) or that it is 
              completely relativistic (as claimed by many school textbooks, possibly 
              in pursuance of Ramakrishna). I was particularly happy with his 
              confrontation of Zaehner (<i>Our Savage God</i>, 1974) who inferred 
              a relationship between the theory of transcendence and a famous 
              cult murder of the late 60's (page 213). Lipner accuses the author 
              of mis-contextualisation and adds, 'Zaehner's is a not uncommon 
              (Western) misunderstanding about Upanishadic morality, and one often 
              resorted to for tendentious purposes.' 
            <p align=LEFT>Dr Lipner also confronts other widely-held assumptions. 
              What stands out most prominently though is his appraisal of the 
              relative positions of <i>dvaita</i> (personalism) and <i>advaita</i> 
              (impersonalism). All too often Sankara's monistic position is held 
              to be comprehensively representative of the Hindu tradition. Dr 
              Lipner is clearly aware of this error. For example, in discussing 
              the <i>Upanisads</i> he writes, '...Radhakrishnan favours an Advaitic, 
              i.e. monist, interpretation.... This represents only one important 
              traditional systematic approach to the <i>Upanisads,</i> and by 
              no means the dominant one.' (Chapter 2, Note 14). And again, 'There 
              seems to be no doubt that the <i>Gita</i> is a genuinely devotional 
              text...so that the monistic interpretations appear strained.' Another 
              common misconception, amongst scholars and Hindu intelligentsia, 
              is that <i>bhakti</i> and the monistic doctrine are compatible (how 
              common this is in school textbooks!) Lipner admirably refutes this: 
              'In this [impersonal] vision, which is <i>jnana</i> proper, all 
              dualistic distinctions, including the finite-infinite divide, dissolve 
              into an all-consuming monistic experience. Then there is nothing 
              to show <i>bhakti</i> to.' This argument is remarkably consistent 
              with Vaishnava thought. 
            <p align=LEFT>Again without resorting to monism, Lipner also resolves 
              the often perceived tension between belief in a multiplicity of 
              deities and the claim that 'God is One'. He calls this 'inclusive 
              monotheism', which may be a term useful to devotees. 
            <p
 align=LEFT>It is significant, I feel, that the final chapter focuses on <i>bhakti</i> 
              and liberation, although Lipner's concept of <i>bhakti</i> does 
              not always concur with ISKCON's. For example he states, 'A God keen 
              to enter into a personal saving relationship with the world. In 
              short, a God of <i>pravritti.</i>' And again, 'The Lord himself 
              is chained to all, the Lord is creation-bound.' He seems to not 
              have completely grasped the transcendental nature of the Lord and 
              again I perceive a particularly Christian point of view. Nevertheless, 
              Lipner's contribution towards a better understanding of the Vedic 
              tradition in terms of the existence (and possibly pre-eminence) 
              of a personalistic theology is, in itself, an important one-and, 
              I believe, a significant one-for ISKCON and how it is perceived 
              in the world. 
            <p
 align=LEFT>Despite some of its shortcomings, this book is a valuable contribution 
              to understanding Hinduism. I heartily recommend it both to the academic 
              world and to devotees wishing to understand their broader tradition 
              and how it is perceived by others.
