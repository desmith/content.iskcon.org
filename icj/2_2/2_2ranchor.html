            <p align=LEFT><i>This paper was the ISKCON keynote address at an Inter-faith 
              conference hosted by our communications group in the UK and devotees 
              in Bhaktivedanta Manor. Twenty Christians and twenty ISKCON members 
              took part in the exchange, which was described by Rev. Michael Barnes 
              SJ as, &quot;one of those rare occasions when head and heart seemed 
              somehow to be united.... I was left wondering why it is that Catholics 
              and Vaishnava Hindus get on so well together.&quot; Ranchor's paper 
              was very well received and the sincere realisation and gift of presentation 
              it displays can serve us as well in our efforts in dialogue with 
              other faith communities.</i> 
            <p> My first attempt at inter-faith dialogue was a bit of a disaster. 
              As a young man of twenty I was out chanting on the streets of the 
              West End with my newly-found brothers and sisters of the Radha Krishna 
              Temple. We danced in a double file along the side of the pavement 
              to the rhythm of drums and cymbals, chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. 
              Turning from Oxford Street up Tottenham Court Road, we found a place 
              where the pavement widened out and paused there to allow a crowd 
              to gather. People began to stop and look on with curiosity, some 
              of them smiling and laughing, or nodding their heads in time with 
              the music. 
            <p>A few of us started to sell our magazine, <i>Back To Godhead</i>. 
              I was one of those, and as I walked among the crowd, offering it 
              to anyone who looked interested, I noticed a middle-aged man wearing 
              the white collar and black suit of a Catholic priest. With him were 
              a young couple, and the three of them stood at the edge of the crowd. 
              I had grown up as a Catholic, so I thought, 'Here are some friends 
              from the Catholic church. They believe in God, so I'm sure they'll 
              understand what we're doing.' 
            <p>Smiling broadly, I approached them. To my surprise, as soon as 
              the priest saw me with my saffron robes and shaven head, and a Back 
              To Godhead in my outstretched hand, he recoiled and declared in 
              a loud voice so that others could hear, 'You're not singing to God, 
              you're singing to the devil!' and he indignantly swept away, taking 
              his young friends with him. 
            <p>I was puzzled. I had hoped to share a mutual understanding with 
              the priest: after all, he was committed to the service of God, and 
              now so was I. In today's materialistic society, I thought, those 
              who were serving God should support each other and feel solidarity 
              together. If his reaction was to be typical of other Christians, 
              then I was going to find it difficult to relate to. 
            <p>I soon found that not all Christians had his attitude, and thankfully 
              many were very appreciative of Krishna Consciousness. Nevertheless, 
              it was clear that inter-religious understanding was not something 
              to be taken for granted, and this gave me a personal sense of purpose. 
              With my extensive Catholic background and my present faith in Krishna, 
              I felt I had a 'mission to explain'. 
            <p>&nbsp;I have often been asked why I converted from Catholicism 
              to Krishna Consciousness. My reply is always that I did not convert: 
              I built on the faith I already had. My roots are in Christianity, 
              and I cannot change that. I cannot change the fact that for the 
              first twenty years of my life God appeared to me through Jesus; 
              that my character and morals were moulded by Sisters of the Holy 
              Cross and Benedictine monks; and that a Christian church to me is 
              still a holy place where I intuitively feel at home. 
            <p>Nonetheless, the question remains: what made me decide to become 
              a devotee of Krishna? One major attraction was the chanting of the 
              Holy Name. The simplicity of just chanting was irresistible. Devotees 
              chant in two ways. One is by singing together, and the other is 
              by private prayer. My first encounter with the singing was on television, 
              when I watched the 73-year-old founder of the Hare Krishna Movement, 
              Srila Prabhupada, being interviewed on Late Night Line-Up in 1969. 
              Prabhupada explained to his interviewer that he had come to Britain 
              to teach how to love God. His wise and kindly face and his sincere 
              voice seemed to tell to me that he knew what he was talking about. 
              'And which God are you referring to - the same one as Christians 
              worship?' asked the interviewer. I wondered what his answer would 
              be. Could he be worshipping the same God as me? 
            <p>'Yes, I am speaking of the same God,' replied Prabhupada. Hearing 
              this, my interest deepened. I had always wanted to learn from someone 
              of another religious tradition about their idea of God. 
            <p>'And how do you teach that we should love God?' 
            <p>'The easiest and most direct way is to chant His name,' Prabhupada 
              replied, 'If you chant the name of God, you can not only love Him, 
              but you can speak to Him face to face, just as I am speaking to 
              you.' I was intrigued. He spoke with such conviction, but surely 
              it couldn't be that simple. 
            <p>Prabhupada got up and walked across to another part of the studio 
              where six of his disciples were waiting with musical instruments. 
              Together they sat in a circle on the studio floor. A rich harmony 
              swelled up from the Indian harmonium and a stringed instrument called 
              a tambura, accompanied by small cymbals and a clay drum. Then Prabhupada 
              began to chant the Hare Krishna mantra, rhythmically, majestically, 
              while the devotees chanted their response. Together they wove a 
              mystical web of transcendental sound that seemed to stretch from 
              the studio right across the country and into my heart. 
            <p>The closing credits of the programme rolled down the screen and 
              I prayed that the chanting wouldn't stop, not yet! But too soon 
              it faded away and the screen went blank. From that day I never needed 
              to be convinced of the simple truth that just by chanting the Holy 
              Name it is possible to see God. 
            <p>Later on, when I met the devotees in person in London, I had another 
              experience with chanting, this time the recitation of the mantra 
              using prayer beads. A japa mala has 108 beads; on each bead the 
              Hare Krishna mantra is chanted. This completes one round. Serious 
              devotees of Krishna are normally expected to chant sixteen times 
              round their prayer beads each day, which takes about two hours. 
              This chanting is done softly to oneself as a meditation. I wanted 
              to live the life of a devotee, but I hesitated to make such a commitment. 
              So on my second visit to the temple I arrived in the early hours 
              of the morning to experience the devotees chanting on their beads. 
            <p>Let me describe the scene. Outside it was still dark and the pavements 
              were empty. In the small shrine room a dozen men and women were 
              praying. The smell of incense filled the air. The curtains of the 
              shrine were open revealing the sacred images of Radha and Krishna, 
              from Whom a soft golden light cast shadows between the pillars along 
              the sides of the room. At the rear of the room a young man, his 
              beads held out before him and his eyes closed, moved from side to 
              side in a hypnotic dance, absorbed in chanting. Others sat in the 
              shadows, some contemplating the forms of Radha and Krishna or the 
              many devotional pictures hung around the room. Before the shrine 
              a young woman swayed back and forth blissfully smiling as she gazed 
              at Krishna and almost sang her mantras. In one hand were her prayer 
              beads; in the other she held a cord attached to a row of small bells 
              hanging from the ceiling, which tinkled melodically along with her 
              chanting. Everyone chanted softly but intently, and the sounds in 
              the room merged into a harmony of divine sound alive with sacred 
              energy. I was swept up by the atmosphere and sat down to chant with 
              my own beads. That morning, with no need of further encouragement, 
              I completed sixteen rounds without difficulty and knew that I would 
              become a devotee. 
            <p>As I learned how to chant Krishna's names on prayer beads, I found 
              I was able to pray to God in a direct, uncomplicated way I had never 
              experienced before. I could feel His presence through the sound 
              vibration of the mantra. 
            <p>The mahamantra is made up of three names: KRISHNA, RAMA and HARE. 
              Krishna and Rama are names for God. KRISHNA means the most attractive 
              person, and RAMA means the source of all happiness. Both of these 
              names describe God in a very personal way as the focus of devotion 
              and joy. HARE refers to the loving mercy of God, without which we 
              could not know Him. This mercy is personified as Radha, Krishna's 
              eternal companion. She is the female aspect of Krishna, and the 
              embodiment of pure love and mercy. The mahamantra is a prayer to 
              Mother Hara to engage us in the loving service of Krishna, the giver 
              of all happiness. 
            <p>In the spirit of the chanting, I began to think of God as Krishna. 
              It made sense to me that God should be eternally youthful and at 
              play. The wise old man whom I had been shown as a child had never 
              quite fit my image of God, and had left a gap of uncertainty, which 
              I had filled with the vague sense of an unknowable, invisible, all-pervasive 
              Spirit. Now that I had the image of Krishna, I embraced Him through 
              chanting His name, reading about Him and meditating on His picture, 
              and for the first time I felt a personal relationship with God. 
            <p>While visiting the temple I was introduced to the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. 
              I found it quite different from any book I had read before, except 
              the New Testament. It seemed to me they both had the same authentic 
              voice of divine wisdom. The teachings presented by Krishna were 
              profoundly meaningful for me. I had always held an intuitive belief 
              in God and reincarnation, and here I found them both clearly described. 
              As Krishna spoke of the eternal self which is never born and never 
              dies, but which passes from one body to another, I had the feeling 
              that I was hearing words that I had heard before. It was as if I 
              was being reminded of things I had once known but had forgotten. 
            <p>One teaching made particular sense for me. In the sixth chapter 
              of the <i>Gita</i> Arjuna asks Krishna an important question: 'What 
              becomes of the one who starts on the spiritual path but who does 
              not reach the end; who falls away because of attraction to the world 
              he has left behind?' Arjuna's fear is that if he tries to achieve 
              his spiritual goal but fails, he will end up losing everything in 
              the process. 
            <p>Krishna's answer is that one who has begun the path to God is never 
              disappointed. A devotee who fails to complete the path in this life 
              will get the chance to carry on in the next life. So, if I have 
              made a certain amount of progress, and achieved a certain level 
              of understanding in some previous lifetime, that level will be revived 
              in my present life. It is Krishna who reminds me of that spiritual 
              knowledge from within my heart and who makes sure that I am able 
              to continue on my path from the point where I left off. 
            <p>When I read this I felt Krishna was speaking directly to me. I 
              felt that I must have encountered Krishna in a previous life, and 
              that now He had intervened in my present life to bring me back to 
              His path. With this understanding I decided to make a commitment 
              to Krishna. 
            <p>Becoming vegetarian was easy, because the food which the devotees 
              ate was so attractive it left me with no taste for meat. It seemed 
              so obvious that meat-eating should be avoided if possible: how could 
              killing animals, who were also God's children, be compatible with 
              a life of love and service to God? The other rules for temple life 
              were: no gambling, no intoxication and no illicit sex. Cigarettes 
              and alcohol were no problem and I had never gambled. Celibacy was 
              more of a challenge, but I was ready to give it a try, until such 
              time as I might get married. I moved into the temple twenty-four 
              years ago this week. 
            <p>An important part of my faith since then has been my relationship 
              with my guru as teacher, friend and guide. He always spoke as an 
              expert scholar with deep knowledge of the Vedic scriptures, and 
              his words have been a constant source of inspiration and understanding. 
              My personal feelings towards him, which are like those of a son 
              to a loving father, are at the heart of my belief and commitment 
              to Krishna. 
            <p>When my faith is tested by difficulties or doubts, it is the certain 
              knowledge that he believes in me, and wants me to stay faithful, 
              that keeps me going. He always said that most of all what made him 
              happy was to see his disciples happy in Krishna consciousness. He 
              defined Krishna consciousness as active service to Krishna, something 
              which everyone can do, even a child, and he very much favoured preaching. 
              His one direct and personal instruction to me was, &quot;Somehow 
              or other, preach.&quot; I carry those words in my heart. 
            <p>It is not just that he wanted this: the whole line of teachers 
              who came before him, all the way back to Sri Caitanya who founded 
              the Hare Krishna movement five hundred years ago, wanted the same 
              thing. It is a myth that Hinduism has never been a missionary religion: 
              there have been many preachers and reformers in Indian religious 
              history, among whom Sri Caitanya is very great. So when my guru 
              asked me, and all his disciples, to preach, he was only passing 
              on the family values. And he himself practised what he preached. 
              He always said that his only qualification was that he was carrying 
              out the order which he had received from his own guru, to teach 
              Krishna consciousness to the English speaking world. 
            <p>The knowledge that I have a spiritual father who has asked something 
              from me, and who is relying on me to carry the message of Krishna 
              consciousness into my own community, is at the foundation of my 
              spiritual life. It is mainly because of my feelings for him that 
              I stay in the religious organisation which he founded. Over the 
              years there have been many good reasons to leave - poverty, disagreements, 
              bad leadership and the knowledge that others think I'm crazy to 
              be a Hare Krishna follower. But what keeps me here is my relationship 
              with my guru, my desire to please him and not to let him down, and 
              to pass on to others what he gave to me. How else can a son repay 
              his father's love? 
            <p>In the years since becoming a disciple of Srila Prabhupada I have 
              seen many changes. In the early years of the Hare Krishna Movement 
              we tended to keep ourselves separate from outsiders, except to preach 
              to them. The price of joining was high. You had to give up all thoughts 
              of education or a career. We were drop-outs from mainstream society. 
              This marginalised our community from the world about us. 
            <p>There is something about life on the fringes that is quite appealing 
              in its rejection of materialism and its idealistic spirit. But there 
              are problems arising from the isolation it brings, such as the dispute 
              between our community here at Bhaktivedanta Manor and some of the 
              villagers of Letchmore Heath, which in the past was fuelled by our 
              own isolation from the village community. 
            <p>This isolation is now diminishing as more and more Krishna devotees 
              are family people living in the wider society. I myself now live 
              as a family man and work for a living as a writer. During the last 
              ten years I have felt the need to establish my own independence 
              and make my own decisions after years of semi- institutional living 
              in Hare Krishna communities. This has made me less dependent on 
              the movement and brought me more in contact with everyday society. 
              My children belong to a generation who are growing up with Krishna 
              Consciousness as their religion in the same way as others are Christians 
              or Jews. Seeing them growing up in a world full of uncertainty, 
              I am more than ever aware of their need for a clear set of beliefs 
              and values on which to base their lives. 
            <p>In this time of change, the Hare Krishna Movement is very much 

              in need of its links with those sections of society who understand 
              it and with whom we have things in common. This particularly points 
              to the religious community. Some of our most valuable friends come 
              from other religious groups. They are the first to appreciate the 
              problems we encounter as a small religious movement new to this 
              country. We have much to learn from these friends and I hope that 
              they also feel that we have something of value to offer in return. 
            <p>I would like to think that every religious group has something 
              unique to contribute to the world, especially in this age of materialism. 
              If Krishna Consciousness has something to offer, I think it is the 
              combination of a clearly articulated philosophy of the soul, karma 
              and reincarnation as taught in the Bhagavad Gita with devotion to 
              a very personal God in the form of Krishna: a God of grace who shows 
              mercy, forgiveness and love. This personal God pervades the universe. 
              In the words of Krishna in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>: 
            <ul>
              <p>I am the taste of water, The light of the sun and moon, The heat 
                in fire, The fragrance of the earth And the life of all that lives. 
                (BG. 7.8-9) 
            </ul>
            <p>God is not just present in the world about us, He also lives in 
              the heart of every living being. This mystery is taught by Krishna: 
            <ul>
              <p>I am in the heart of every being, Giving knowledge, remembrance 
                and forgetfulness. (BG. 15.15) 
            </ul>
            <p>Although God dwells in my heart, and although He knows everything 
              about my past, present and future, I do not know Him. But Krishna 
              teaches that I can know Him through <i>bhakti,</i> or loving service-a 
              ceaseless act of love which fills every waking moment: 
            <ul>
              <p>Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give 
                away, whatever hardships you undergo-make these an offering to 
                Me. (BG. 9.27) 
            </ul>
            <p>This is the basis of our daily life as devotees of Krishna. We 
              try to relate all our actions to Him, so that even the simplest 
              deeds, like eating breakfast or putting out the rubbish, become 
              a meditation upon God. Through such constant devotion, Krishna is 
              revealed to His devotee. As He says: 
            <ul>
              <p>To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, 
                I give the understanding by which they can come to Me. (BG. 10.10) 
            </ul>
            <p>This is the essence of Krishna's teachings in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. 
              When He is served with constant love and devotion He reveals Himself. 
              He releases His devotee from the <i>karma</i> of past sins and from 
              all material attachments, filling His devotee's heart with the light 
              of pure knowledge of Him. <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> teaches us to look 
              for God as our dearest friend-who knows us better than anyone else, 
              who accompanies us through countless lifetimes in this world, and 
              who invites us to live with Him forever. 
            <p>There are many stories of Krishna which help us understand Him 
              in a personal and loving way. Krishna lives in the eternal forest 
              of Vrindavan, the source of all life, where He is surrounded by 
              His friends, the cowherd girls and boys, and looked after by His 
              mother and father, Yasoda and Nanda. When He was a small boy, Krishna 
              and His brother used to go out and play with their young friends. 
              One day, when they came home for lunch, Krishna's brother and the 
              other boys complained to Yasoda: 
            <p>'Mother, Krishna has been eating clay.' 
            <p>Yasoda caught Krishna's hand and said, 'Why have you been eating 
              earth? All the boys are complaining about you.' 
            <p>'Mother,' said Krishna, 'they're all lying. I never ate any clay. 
              They just want to get me into trouble. If you believe them, why 
              don't you look inside my mouth and see.' 
            <p>'Very well, open your mouth.' 
            <p>So Krishna did as He was told and opened His mouth. Inside His 
              mouth, Yasoda saw the whole creation. She saw mountains, islands, 
              oceans and planets; the sun, moon, stars, and outer space; she saw 
              all the universe; and she saw herself, with her child Krishna on 
              her lap. She was dumbstruck. She didn't know whether she was dreaming 
              or was actually seeing something real. She thought she must be mad. 
            <p>In this troubled state, she began to pray, 'Let me offer my respects 
              to the Supreme Lord, under whose influence I am thinking that Nanda 
              is my husband, that I am queen of this village, that the cowherd 
              men and women are my subjects, and that Krishna is my son. All these 
              illusions are brought about by the power of the Lord. I pray that 
              He will always protect me.' 
            <p>Seeing her bewildered condition, Krishna overwhelmed her with feelings 
              of love. She forgot her confusion and turned her attention back 
              to Krishna. Taking Him on her lap, she gave Him a big hug full of 
              motherly love and thought, 'Krishna is my own child.' 
            <p>Stories such as this are powerful ways of meditating upon God as 
              a personal, loving and accessible friend. I should emphasise that 
              they are not mere stories: they are windows to a higher reality 
              allowing devotees to actually experience the presence of Krishna. 
            <p>All over the world in the late twentieth century children of Christians 
              have adopted Krishna Consciousness as a means to understanding their 
              place in the universe, and as a way of exploring their feelings 
              for God. My own view of this phenomena is based on my understanding 
              of reincarnation as taught in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>. As I mentioned 
              earlier, <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> teaches that God revives a person's 
              faith in Him from one lifetime to the next, so that the soul may 
              gradually progress on her path back to Godhead. It is my belief 
              that some in the West, through repeated births in Christian countries, 
              have found a personal and devotional faith in God, and that this 
              faith has brought them to Krishna. 
            <p>The growth of Krishna Consciousness outside India forms part of 
              a wider spiritual transition in the West. This transition is from 
              an age of institutional religion dominated by the duality's of punishment 
              and reward, heaven and hell, sacred and profane, to an age of holistic 
              religion which reveals God's presence in the heart of the individual, 
              in the natural world, in daily life and in the community: a personal 
              religion based not on fear but on love. 
            <p>In closing, I must give mention to a man who encouraged me on my 
              path at a crucial time many years ago. In 1970, when my father discovered 
              that I was about to move into the Krishna temple, he asked me to 
              spend a week with the Benedictine monks of Worth Abbey, who had 
              educated me, to discuss my decision with them. I gladly went down 
              to Sussex and had a wonderful time chanting in the woods and telling 
              them all about Krishna. On the eve of my departure back to London 
              the saintly Abbot, Dom Victor Farwell (now sadly deceased), called 
              me to his room. He told me some of the monks were worried about 
              me and were preparing to hold a vigil to pray for my soul. However, 
              he said he did not share their worry. 
            <p>'If I was your age,' he assured me, 'I would do exactly as you 
              are. May God bless you!' So I began my life as a devotee of Krishna 
              with his blessings, and, I felt in my heart, with the blessings 
              of Jesus Christ.
