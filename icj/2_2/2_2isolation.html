              dasa Goswami </b></a> 
            <p align=LEFT><i>&nbsp;This article by Hrdayananda dasa Goswami challenges 
              the theory of isolationism constructed by modern psychology and 
              it serves as a response to an article by Professor Lewis Rambo in 
              particular. He attempts to show us here that this paradigm of isolation 
              does not serve as a very effective tool in the objective analysis 
              of religious communities. He consequently calls into question the 
              habit of social scientists to observe their subjects from predetermined 
              vantage points which tend to undervalue fundamental philosophical 
              and motivational tenets of their subjects thus compromising their 
              observations. If the effect of this phenomenon were purely academic 
              few would worry about this but the effect is often translated into 
              public misconceptions, sensationalism and even fear.</i> 
            <p>In his article, 'Psychology of Conversion'<a href="#1">1</a> Professor 
              Lewis Rambo presents a heuristic stage model of the conversion process. 
              His article presents a good picture of current social scientific 
              approaches to the conversion experience, from the pen of a learned 
              and sympathetic scholar. Within his model, the first stage is 'context', 
              and in that section Professor Rambo discusses 'isolation', a controversial 
              feature of religious training. We will briefly explore this category 
              to illustrate the different ways in which social science and religion 
              can approach the same phenomenon from different perspectives. A 
              similar analysis can be done for the other categories, but we will 
              limit our discussion to isolation. 
            <p>Monotheistic religious communities typically teach that we can 
              all realise our true nature, identity, and function, through loving 
              service to God. Modern society, however, tends to be 'me-centred' 
              rather than God-centred, self-gratifying rather than self-sacrificing. 
              Thus many religious teachers try to protect or insulate their students 
              from what they perceive to be the corrupting influence of a sensuous 
              social environment. As described by Professor Rambo, this has provoked 
              criticism. 
            <p> Many believe that some religious groups deliberately isolate themselves 
              from the wider world... so that people may be rendered compliant 
              to the wishes of the group, which considers itself in special relationship 
              to the divine.<a href="#2">2</a> 
            <p>In trying to understand the 'isolation' issue as it relates to 
              the Krishna consciousness movement (ISKCON), I will make three claims: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Isolation is not unique to religious movements, such as ISKCON, 
                but is actually a universal social phenomenon.</li>
              <li> Society often tries to isolate its members from ISKCON.</li>
              <li> The language and assumptions of social science often reflect 
                an anti-religious bias which underlies many of the attacks on 
                the Krishna Consciousness Movement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;To isolate, in a social context, means to place a person 
              apart or alone, to separate a person from others. Here are some 
              common examples of isolation: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>Americans working in underdeveloped countries often live in 
                tightly insulated American neighbourhoods, complete with American 
                clubs, stores, and recreation facilities.</li>
              <li> Overseas American schools are designed to avoid excessive contact 
                of American children with the host culture, or 'native population'.</li>
              <li> Nowadays the affluent often seek security and social isolation 
                behind the armed gates of 'private communities'. </li>
              <li> Scholars traditionally isolate their disciplines behind the 
                steep walls of technical language and sophisticated methodology 
                which are virtually inaccessible, if not unintelligible, for people 
                in general. </li>
              <li> Mothers and fathers attempt to isolate their children from 
                what they perceive as corrupting influences in the 'wider world'.</li>
              <li> Nationalism creates a distinct national identity which isolates 
                citizens from a broader identification with people of other nations. 
              </li>
              <li>Certain philosophies and theologies isolate mankind from the 
                rest of nature, thus discouraging broad-based empathy with other 
                life forms and species. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a way of organising society and culture, isolation is virtually 
              a universal phenomenon. Indeed, isolating mechanisms are employed 
              so routinely, they are almost unconscious. 
            <p>Scholars frequently cite cases of a numerically smaller group, 
              a 'micro-context', counteracting the influence of a numerically 
              larger group, a 'macro-context', thus isolating its members from 
              the 'wider world'. It is also interesting to note, however, the 
              many cases of a numerically larger group seeking to impose its vales 
              by isolating people from an unusual or 'aberrant' micro-contextual 
              influence. Powerful social forces, such as the media, law-enforcement 
              officials, legislators, and deprogrammers, often seek to discourage 
              people from participating in a minority religion, such as Krishna 
              consciousness, through slanted media coverage, legal harassment, 
              and free-speech restrictions that cripple the open forum. In the 
              course of our missionary work, we have personally observed many 
              such cases, a few of which can be mentioned here: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li>In Russia, devotees were imprisoned, tortured, and even killed 
                for the crime of practising Krishna consciousness. These devotees 
                were widely recognised by the international community as prisoners 
                of conscience.</li>
              <li>In Greece, new members of the Krishna consciousness movement 
                have been regularly subjected to overwhelming harassment by family, 
                press, and government, making it almost impossible for them to 
                practice Krishna consciousness in Greece.</li>
              <li>In Argentina, a neo-fascist military dictatorship which seized 
                power in 1977 persecuted and banned the Hare Krishna movement 
                along with most other minority denominations. On the island of 
                Bali, Hindu caste brahmanas, fearing loss of priestly revenue 
                and prestige, conspired with the Muslim government to ban the 
                Hare Krishna movement in Indonesia.</li>
              <li>In the United States, hired 'deprogrammers' kidnapped members 
                of the Krishna consciousness movement, subjecting them to physical 
                and mental abuse in a captive state until they recanted their 
                religious views or escaped.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although ISKCON can and does fight back, legal and media remedies 
              are often so costly that a type of Pyrrhic victory is achieved. 
              Indeed, in the United States, those who oppose Krishna consciousness 
              have openly articulated a policy of harassing ISKCON through costly 
              legal battles. 
            <p>The above examples illustrate how a larger social group may seek 
              to isolate its members from the influence of the Krishna consciousness 
              movement. But this fact is usually neglected or perhaps unobserved, 
              by traditional social scientific studies of religious movements, 
              especially when the religious movements are perceived as new, strange, 
              and intense. 
            <p>Professor Rambo states that scholars need to acknowledge the more 
              subtle values inherent in their theoretical models and analytical 
              tools. For instance, if psychologists are attempting to evaluate 
              the mental health consequences of conversions, do they recognise 
              the cultural values which shape their model of mental health? Do 
              they recognise how their model might be differently constituted 
              in other cultures?<a href="#3"> 3</a> 
            <p>Let us give a concrete example of 'cultural values which shape' 

              the work of social scientists. Those involved in the scholarly study 
              of religion often refer to religious doctrines as 'belief systems', 
              'stories', and 'myths'. They talk about people engaging in 'world 
              construction' in order to 'create meaning and purpose in life.' 
              Clearly a normal spiritual viewpoint would be that meaning and purpose 
              exist in life. We discover them. We don't create them, just as we 
              don't create the fundamental reality of the physical world. And 
              although academicians have recently refurbished the concept of myth, 
              it retains a disquieting sense of a made-up tale, albeit an instructive 
              and edifying tale. Indeed we should keep well in mind that although 
              certain terms such as 'belief system', 'story', 'myth', 'world-construction' 
              etc. are used in special ways in social science, these words are 
              clearly flavoured to some degree by their non-technical, ordinary 
              usage. Thus the phrase 'isolate...from the wider world' can be extremely 
              misleading since it makes us feel that the isolated ones are confined 
              to a 'narrower world' and hence are being existentially impoverished. 
              To call materialistic society the 'wider world' is, in one sense, 
              as ludicrous as calling the inside of Plato's cave the 'wider world' 
              based on the numerical strength of the cave-dwellers, in contrast 
              to those who have escaped the dark cave for the light of the absolute. 
              In fact, a materialistic society, especially ours today, would appear 
              itself to be dangerously isolated from a larger, and more meaningful 
              spiritual reality. 
            <p>Social scientists often reply that they cannot endorse or validate 
              a particular spiritual doctrine, and thus they have recourse to 
              a neutral or objective language. And yet, although we may agree 
              that the dispassionate discussion of religion requires a neutral, 
              objective language, current social science terminology does not 
              fully provide it. Meaningful discussion of religion, even from the 
              social scientific standpoint, would be greatly enhanced by a language 
              which was more truly neutral and objective. 
            <p>The limits of the social science approach to spiritual reality 
              are clearly stated by Professor Rambo in his discussion of one branch 
              of social science, psychology: 'Scientific psychology is a human 
              discipline which can only attempt to use theories to understand 
              a phenomenon that is beyond the scope of human comprehension.'<a href="#4">4</a> 
              Mundane sciences seek knowledge which gives mankind independent 
              power over nature. The Krishna conscious view, however, is that 
              our perfection as living beings lies in our submission to a supreme 
              controller, and that the highest knowledge is forthcoming from spiritual 
              surrender. It is not surprising therefore that psychoanalysis and 
              behaviourism tend to be at odds with Krishna consciousness. There 
              is not so much a problem of differing experimental data, or data 
              vs. faith, as there is a simple conflict in world view, in axiomatic 
              starting points. 
            <p>The Krishna consciousness movement challenges and strongly criticises 
              materialistic values. This may hurt and anger persons who formerly 
              held important or authoritative positions in the lives of converts, 
              and who seem to be directly or indirectly exposed and discredited 
              by the strong spiritual philosophy of the Krishna consciousness 
              movement. 
            <p>Krishna conscious devotees strive for purity in an admittedly materialistic 
              age. Naturally some people interpret that as a form of unhealthy 
              isolation. Underlying this view, we would contend, is the materialistic 
              conviction that there is little of substance in the spiritual life. 
              Real pleasure comes from the physical senses. Real relationships 
              are in this world, with one's friends, family, and sex partners. 
              God is remote, vague, and tentative, whereas things of this world 
              are bright, immediate, and real. This philosophy often underlies 
              the fear that the disciplined, devoted lifestyle of Krishna consciousness 
              is unhealthy and wrong. 
            <p>It is interesting to note that in less materialistic societies, 
              the Krishna conscious devotees tend to have a more relaxed and engaging 
              relationship with the 'wider world'. For example, in many Asian 
              countries, devotees move freely in the surrounding society, without 
              fear of constant ridicule, kidnapping, or physical abuse. The same 
              robes which provoke mockery in one place, are highly revered in 
              other lands as the dress of a saintly priest. 
            <p>In many ways, mainstream society itself seems to have evolved into 
              a type of bizarre cult, a cult in which people pour adulation and 
              worship on drug addicts, adulterers, gamblers, and animal killers 
              who may possess a materially gratifying talent. Similar worship 
              is lavished on those who, by hook or by crook, accumulate ephemeral 
              fortunes and power. 
            <p>We should remember that the world is not evil for a Krishna conscious 
              person. The ontology of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> clearly identifies 
              the physical cosmos as a divine emanation from God. It is rather 
              our misuse of this world that is wrong. When God's creation is engaged 
              in His loving service, even matter regains its original spiritual 
              quality. Thus a devotee of Krishna seeks to establish a positive 
              relationship with all that exists, by seeing all things in relation 
              to Krishna. A clear grasp of this ancient ontology is crucial to 
              a fair understanding of the issue of 'isolation' as it occurs in 
              the Krishna consciousness movement. 
            <p>Isolation necessitates the renunciation of that from which one 
              seeks to isolate oneself. The search for a clear definition of renunciation 
              is a central theme in the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>.<a href="#5">5</a> 
              Arjuna, the Lord's student, wants to give up his worldly duties, 
              whereas Lord Krishna repeatedly reminds him that real renunciation 
              means to perform one's duty, but without desire for the fruit of 
              action. It is our greed and lust for the fruit of our work, and 
              not the work itself, which we must renounce. The Supreme Lord is 
              the enjoyer of the fruit, and we should work for His satisfaction. 
              Work for the Lord's satisfaction is called <i>yajna</i>, or 'sacrifice.' 
              Thus the things of this world can be engaged in the Lord's service 
              and, in the process, spiritualised. Our home can be a place of ordinary 
              gratification, or it can be consecrated as a temple of God. Similarly, 
              the food we eat can be offered to God, and by eating the remnants 
              of sacrifice to God, we sanctify our existence. Without offering 
              our food in sacrifice, the <i>Gita</i> explains, we are eating only 
              sin. 
            <p>The Krishna consciousness movement teaches, on the authority of 
              <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, that all our activities should be performed 
              as sacrifice to the Supreme Lord. Work in sacrifice to Krishna is 
              free of reaction, or entanglement in the material laws of <i>karma</i> 
              which oblige us to repeatedly accept the miseries of birth, old 
              age, disease, and death. 
            <p>The Krishna consciousness movement does not require isolation from 
              the world, per se, but rather that all our acts be performed as 
              loving service unto the Supreme Lord. Since the Lord is the creator 
              and proprietor of all things, serving Him is a truly logical or 
              rational response to this world. 
            <p>A devotee of Krishna satisfies his senses within the Lord's service. 
              Just as we nourish a tree by watering its root, we can similarly 
              satisfy the individual soul by satisfying the Supreme Lord, who 
              is the source of the soul's existence. 
            <p>When an entire society is absorbed in sense gratification, the 
              society becomes a source of pollution for the pure soul. A society 
              dedicated to the loving service of the Lord would be a sublime environment 
              for the Lord's devotee. The world is not necessarily evil, we just 
              make it that way. And yet, as a devotee of the Lord advances in 
              his spiritual comprehension, he learns to turn the world towards 
              the Lord's service. There were many Vaishnava saints who actively 
              engaged in this world without compromising their spiritual purity. 
              Thus in the advanced stage of Krishna consciousness, the same material 
              objects that once threatened the devotees nascent spiritual understanding, 
              now appear as promising challenges and opportunities to transform 
              a mundane world into the divine kingdom.

            <p><b>Postscript<br>
              </b>I originally presented this paper at a conference on religious 
              conversion in new religious movements, held in 1989, at the Graduate 
              Theological Union, Berkeley, California. Professor Lewis Rambo, 
              whose views I discuss here, was present and after my presentation, 
              he remarked to me that he felt my arguments were valid. Since then, 
              Dr. Rambo has published <i>Understanding Religious Conversion</i> 
              (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1993), in which he has dropped 
              the term 'isolation' in favour of the term 'encapsulation'. He remarks 
              in that book, 'encapsulation is a procedure employed to some extent 
              by everyone who wants to teach something new.' (p. 104) I cannot 
              say whether or to what extent my remarks on these issues have influenced 
              Dr. Rambo in his most recent formulation of his conversion stage 
              model.
