            <p><i>Rasamandala dasa has offered us this article to help clarify 
              some of the concerns and reservations that many of us may have with 
              educational approaches to Vedanta and Hinduism. He reassures us 
              with his positive treatment of the subject and with his obvious 
              experience in the field of teaching Hinduism and Vaishnavism in 
              British schools. He has systematised our objectives very well and 
              marries this to the difficulty in interpretation experienced between 
              members of the tradition and those non-practitioners who attempt 
              to teach the tradition to others. This article is essential for 
              those in our society engaged in the religious or academic fields.</i> 
            <p> In my last article<a href="rasafoot.html#1">1</a>, I applied 
              modern communications theory to explore how presentations to school 
              audiences can improve public perception of ISKCON. We also discussed 
              how, within the statutory educational framework, there may be legitimate 
              scope for teaching about Krishna Consciousness. We also heard how, 
              in Britain, our Society has been fortunate to enjoy both these benefits. 
            <p>However, right from the start, there were a couple of notable challenges. 
              Firstly we were assumed, and required, to represent one of the principle 
              world religions<a href="rasafoot.html#2">2</a>, namely Hinduism. 
              This raised pertinent, and sometimes controversial, theological 
              questions about the identity of ISKCON and its members (we'll come 
              back to this later). Secondly and subsequently, this also meant 
              that ISKCON Educational Services staff were required to make presentations 
              not just on ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, nor on broader Vaishnavism, 
              but on the whole spectrum of Hinduism itself. I began to question 
              whether this supported our Society's aims or was even consistent 
              with them. As I pondered, and read more school textbooks on Hinduism, 
              I considered and noted down some of the possible benefits of speaking 
              and writing about the subject. However, I also noticed in many school 
              textbooks room for considerable improvement. 
            <p>This concerned me. We were, whether we liked it or not, strongly 
              identified with the broader tradition and any misrepresentation 
              of that could reflect badly on ISKCON. On a positive note, it was 
              evident that a large percentage of our presentation material on 
              Hinduism per se was congruent with Krishna Consciousness, giving 
              us ample scope to redress such errors. In other words, I concluded 
              that the reputation of ISKCON, at least within the educational world<a href="rasafoot.html#3">3</a> 
              , depended significantly on public perception of the broader tradition, 
              which we had ample opportunity to influence. 
            <p>What I intend to do here, therefore, is to discuss the educationalists 
              perspective on the Hindu tradition, identifying areas of apparent 
              misunderstanding or misrepresentation. This subject is presented 
              mainly through the experience of our schools programme in the UK, 
              though it naturally has implications on higher academic levels. 
              Indeed, I hope this article, presented here principally for Krishna 
              devotees, will form the basis of an extended study of interest to 
              scholars (in both Religious Education and Religious Studies). My 
              comments here are not intended to be a criticism of the educational 
              and academic worlds, where there is increasing sensitivity towards 
              multi-cultural issues. I hope, though, that by identifying possible 
              shortcomings, in methodology, this article will be constructively 
              challenging. 
            <p>The subject is discussed in terms of the ten objectives which ISKCON 
              Educational Services has formulated in teaching about Hinduism. 
              Each objective (in bold type) is followed by a brief explanation 
              including practical information for devotees making presentations 
              in the educational sphere. 
            <p><b>1. To promote an understanding of the universal and axiomatic 
              principles of <i>Sanatana Dharma</i> and <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i> 
              as revealed through the Vedic scriptures and as particularly embodied 
              by Vaishnavism, and to explain how these relate to the tradition 
              generally called Hinduism.</b> 
            <p>This first objective serves two main purposes: 1) To clarify the 
              meaning of the term 'Hinduism'. and 2) To clearly establish ISKCON's 
              identity in relation to it. 
            <p>ISKCON's relationship to Hinduism is contentious for some devotees, 
              and the Society's often ambivalent stance has been noted by both 
              devotees<a href="rasafoot.html#4">4</a> and academics<a href="rasafoot.html#5">5</a>. 
              For most people (and why not for devotees?) it is convenient, if 
              not necessary, to explain ISKCON's roots in relation to the world 
              we know. With this, however, are theological implications, as explained 
              in the <i>Science of Self Realisation</i>: 
            <ul>
              <p>When attempting to place the Krishna Consciousness movement within 
                a conventional historical-cultural context, many people identify 
                the movement with Hinduism. But this is misleading. Srila Prabhupada 
                <a href="rasafoot.html#6">6</a> disavows connection with the 
                pantheism, polytheism and caste consciousness that pervades modern 
                Hinduism. Although Krishna Consciousness and modern Hinduism share 
                a common historical root-India's ancient Vedic culture-Hinduism 
                has become... a sectarian establishment, whereas Krishna Consciousness 
                is universal and transcends relative, sectarian designations. 
                (SSR. Ch.3. Article: 'Krishna Consciousness: Hindu Cult or Divine 
                Culture?') 
            </ul>
            <p>From this statement, it is not quite clear whether the author<a href="rasafoot.html#7">7</a> 
              is suggesting that ISKCON refute any connection whatsoever with 
              Hinduism. Still, ISKCON devotees well understand the thrust of this 
              statement. The Vedas establish the soul's identity as distinct from 
              the body. Consequently designations such as Hindu, Muslim and Christian 
              are ultimately no less illusory and divisive than discrimination 
              on the grounds of age, race or gender. Srila Prabhupada confirms 
              this: 
            <ul>
              <p>Thus the most dangerous of the dirty things within our hearts 
                is this mis-identification of the body as the self. Under the 
                influence of this misunderstanding, one thinks, 'I am this body. 
                I am an Englishman. I am an Indian. I am an American. I am Hindu. 
                I am Muslim'.<a href="rasafoot.html#8">8</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Nevertheless, in the context of school and college teaching, the 
              simple aphorism 'I am not a Hindu', though doctrinally correct, 
              may need further explanation and may otherwise lead to problems!<a href="rasafoot.html#9">9</a> 
              I'm not suggesting that devotees resort to pragmatic duplicity, 
              pretending to be Hindus whilst inwardly considering otherwise. Rather 
              they have a genuine connection with that tradition and this needs 
              careful definition. 
            <p> Srila Prabhupada elaborates: 
            <ul>
              <p>It (the word Hindu) is neither a Sanskrit word nor is it found 
                in the Vedic literature. But the culture of the Indians or the 
                Hindus is Vedic and begins with the four <i>varnas</i> and <i>asramas</i>... 
                Our Krishna Consciousness Movement is preaching these four <i>varnas</i> 
                and <i>asramas</i>, so naturally it has got some relationship 
                with the Hindus. (Letter from Srila Prabhupada to Janmanjaya and 
                Taradevi, 9th July 1970) 
            </ul>
            <p>As well as confirming 'some relationship', Srila Prabhupada makes 
              a couple of important points: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The culture of the Hindus is Vedic (i.e. derived from the Vedas 
                and their supplements). </li>
              <li>The word Hindu is not found in Vedic literature.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Considering this second point, the question naturally arises, 'Where 
              then does the word come from?' Scholars suggest that it was used 
              as early as the eighth century CE by Persian invaders to refer to 
              the people on the far side of the River Sindhu (now the Indus in 
              Pakistan). It's early connotations were not specifically religious, 
              but social, cultural, political and geographical. Though the terms 
              'Hindu' and 'Hinduism' are now in common use, their exact meanings 
              remain unclear and somewhat arbitrary. Hinduism is not, therefore, 
              necessarily synonymous with <i>Vaidika Dharma</i> (the religion 
              of the Vedas) nor with <i>Sanatana</i> or <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i>. 
              Not all Hindus believe in the pervasive doctrines of karma and rebirth, 
              nor is it clear whether Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists are included 
              in their ranks<a href="rasafoot.html#10">10</a>. However, it 
              is universally accepted that Hinduism was a name given by foreigners, 
              and generally accepted by insiders since the early nineteenth century. 
              They too had difficulties with its exact meaning, as Eleanor Nesbitt 
              explains: 
            <ul>
              <p>'The term Hinduism... is essentially a Western construct. It 
                was the introduction of the concept of Hinduism, and the presence 
                of Westerners talking, writing and asking about Hinduism which 
                led Hindus to try to define true and false Hinduism, which they 
                did (and still do) in different ways. Thus, for example, Bankim 
                Chandra Chatterjee (1838-94) distinguished between 'false and 
                corrupt Hinduism' which Europeans denounced and 'true Hinduism' 
                which, in his case, involved devotion to God and a humanistic 
                ethic (King 1978). For Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), on the other 
                hand, true Hinduism was the monistic philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, 
                which Bankim has rejected as part of false Hinduism. Many more 
                examples could be cited. For our purposes 'Hinduism' is an umbrella 
                term for a great number of practices and beliefs each of which 
                belongs to some of the millions of people who for historical reasons 
                are called Hindus.<br>
                <br>
                Despite countless differences of region and language, these practices 
                and beliefs bear a family likeness. There may be no one founder 
                and no overarching credal statement but there are modes of worship 
                and ways of thinking which appear like a recurrent motif.<a href="rasafoot.html#11">11</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;Despite the lack of clear definition and consequent confusion, 
              Srila Prabhupada clearly favours the meaning of 'the followers of 
              the Vedas' (<i>Vaidika Dharma</i>, as mentioned above). This is 
              the definition which ISKCON Educational Services uses with British 
              schools. The following quotes from Srila Prabhupada may further 
              elucidate: 
            <ul>
              <p>You may call the Vedas Hindu but Hindu is a foreign name. We 
                are not Hindus. Our real identification is <i>Varnashrama</i>. 
                <i>Varnashrama</i> denotes the followers of the Vedas.<a href="rasafoot.html#12">12 
                </a> 
              <p>Formerly, the people of India (now misnamed as 'Hindus') followed 
                <i>Varnashrama dharma</i> or <i>Sanatana Dharma...</i><a href="rasafoot.html#13">13</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Here Srila Prabhupada is equating <i>Vaidika Dharma</i> with both 
              <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i> and <i>Sanatana Dharma </i>.<a href="rasafoot.html#14">14</a> 
              It may of course be incorrect to say that modern Hinduism is <i>Vaidika 
              Dharma</i>, or <i>Sanatana Dharma</i>, since many members of the 
              tradition are not practising scriptural tenets.<a href="rasafoot.html#15">15</a> 
              Nevertheless, accepting this definition of 'genuine Hinduism', there 
              remains diversity which begs cohesive explanation. ISKCON's relationship 
              to the tradition also requires clarification. I list below several 
              points, some or all of which may be useful when giving school presentations: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Hinduism is a foreign name...</li>
              <li>Though the meaning is somewhat arbitrary, we could say that 
                Hinduism means 'those who follow the Vedic scriptures', and that's 
                the definition we'll use. The words 'Hindu' and 'Hinduism' are 
                not found in Vedic literature...</li>
              <li>The Vedic literature favours the term <i>Sanatana Dharma</i> 
                (explain in terms of the eternal soul free from designations, 
                whose natural function is to serve God). </li>
              <li>Hindus believe in <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i>, which was originally 
                determined by qualification rather than birth. </li>
              <li>The Vedas, though ultimately promoting liberation and love of 
                God, accommodate different levels of spirituality, according to 
                the three principal stages of karma, jnana and bhakti.<a href="rasafoot.html#16">16</a></li>
              <li>There are six main philosophical/ theological<a href="rasafoot.html#17">17</a> 
                systems, which are progressive<a href="rasafoot.html#18">18</a> 
                and culminate in Vedanta.<a href="rasafoot.html#19">19</a></li>
              <li>Within Vedanta there are two main schools of thought-monism 
                (impersonalism) and monotheism (personalism). ISKCON is monotheistic. 
                (Explain both schools in relationship to 'the many gods'). </li>
              <li>Within Hinduism today there are three main focuses of worship: 
                Vishnu, Shiva and Shakti (Durga). The Shaivites and Shaktas are 
                more disposed towards impersonalism whereas the Vaishnavas are 
                generally personalists. </li>
              <li>Members of ISKCON are Gaudiya (Bengali) Vaishnavas following 
                in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya...</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The subject is obviously complex! Taking into account the issues 
              of migration and acculturation, modern Hinduism becomes highly enigmatic, 
              particularly for teachers. It is understandable that many school 
              texts misrepresent the tradition through over generalisation. It 
              cannot be accurately represented without appreciation of its great 
              diversity. And yet it needs to be presented, as far as possible, 
              as a unified whole, a comprehensive picture. Explaining its roots 
              in terms of <i>Sanatana Dharma </i>and<i> Varnashrama Dharma</i>, 
              as based on the Vedas, and with particular reference to the self's 
              distinction from the body, can significantly help in this respect. 
            <p>Our first objective then, as discussed above, may help educationalists 
              in untangling the web of religious, social and cultural phenomena 
              which we call Hinduism. Referring back to my doubts about teaching 
              the subject, Srila Prabhupada confirms ISKCON's intended role: 
            <ul>
              <p> Srila Prabhupada said it was certainly a fact that we are the 
                authorities when it comes to teaching what is 'real Hinduism'. 
                It is just and proper that the educational circles of Sweden should 
                accept us as such. (Letter from Tamal Krishna Goswami to H.G. 
                Vegavan Prabhu, 22nd August 1977) 
            </ul>
            <p><b>2. To counteract the portrayal of Hindu theology as either (a) 
              exclusively impersonal or (b) impersonal at best (i.e. monistic, 
              polytheistic, anthropomorphic, but never monotheistic).</b> 
            <p>In teaching about the Vedic tradition this is perhaps ISKCON's 
              principal aim, particularly in consideration of Srila Prabhupada's 
              desires<a href="rasafoot.html#20">20</a>. He writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>With reference to your article in the Los Angeles Times dated 
                Sunday, January 11,1970, under the heading 'Krishna Chant', I 
                beg to point out that the Hindu religion is perfectly based in 
                the personal conception of God, or Vishnu. The impersonal conception 
                of God is a side issue, or one of the three features of God.<a href="rasafoot.html#21">21</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Despite this, almost all authors, teachers and lecturers in Religious 
              Education fail to acknowledge the existence of a monotheism doctrine 
              within Hinduism. A recently available two-volume publication suitably 
              illustrates this point. The first book, covering the Semitic religions-Judaism, 
              Christianity and Islam-is entitled 'Believers in One God'. Implicit 
              in this is the notion that monotheism is absent from the other major 
              traditions- Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism.<a href="rasafoot.html#22">22</a> 
            <p>Text books abound with similar inaccuracies, suggesting that all 
              Hindus ultimately believe in the 'Universal World Soul' (Brahman). 
              Note for example: 
            <ul>
              <p>...frequent use of statues of 'gods and goddesses'. Although 
                these are merely 'pointers' to that which defies full description...<a href="rasafoot.html#23">23</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>or again: 
            <ul>
              <p>It is essential to realise that the images are not worshipped 
                but can be used for the focus of worship as symbols of the One 
                God.<a href="rasafoot.html#24">24</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Why then this inordinate leaning towards impersonalism? I'd suggest 
              several reasons: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Teachers in schools are usually sensitive and, in trying to 
                rationalise the multiplicity of deities (without resorting to 
                polytheism which is unquestionably heretical to the Western mind) 
                find monism a convenient explanation. One textbook illustrate 
                the tension:<br>
                'Hinduism is full of stories of hundreds of gods and of goddesses 
                and lesser celestial beings who people the heavens and earth. 
                Yet most Hindus believe that God is one. Westerners are often 
                baffled by this apparent contradiction or paradox.' And continues: 
                '...but it can be simply explained. Ninian Smart of Lancaster 
                University has likened this [impersonal] idea to that experiment 
                you may have done in Science where a single beam of white light 
                is refracted into many colours by a prism. For most Hindus, their 
                many gods and goddesses display 'aspects' or 'refraction's' of 
                Brahman.' <a href="rasafoot.html#25">25</a><br>
                The personalist, however, can also reconcile 'God is One' with 
                the multiplicity of lesser deities<a href="rasafoot.html#26">26</a> 
                though it may be more complex in the classroom situation. </li>
              <li>Teachers are often eager to dispel any preconception that Hinduism 
                includes idolatry, clearly a heresy to the Western psyche. Monism 
                conveniently but inaccurately explains the use and function of 
                the <i>murti</i> (as illustrated in the quotes above). </li>
              <li>The influence of Vivekananda and other <i>advaitins</i> in promoting 
                Hinduism in the West. </li>
              <li>The natural predisposition which academics have for the path 
                of <i> jnana.</i><a href="rasafoot.html#27">27</a></li>
              <li>The discomfort which some Christians experience in meeting another 
                tradition in which adherents claim a unique, personal relationship 
                with God.<a href="rasafoot.html#28">28</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Room does not permit us here to explore these reasons at length. 
              What is important, though, is to mention that countering the impersonal 
              concept is not easy, even in those whose commitment is only educational! 
              One problem is that <i>bhaktiis</i> (ostensibly) accepted, but again 
              akin to the monist, as a means to an end (<i>mukti</i> or liberation)<a href="rasafoot.html#29">29</a>. 
              Personalism is also apparently accommodated but again in a monistic 
              sense, often mentioned in connection with one's chosen deity (<i>Ishtadev</i>). 
              We may note here the egalitarian connotations! Feminism also has 
              its influence with authors suggesting that God (or Brahman) should 
              be called 'It'-a term that sensitive people wouldn't use for their 
              cat or dog! The subject is complex and I've spent many hours with 
              educationalists, locked in theological discussion; not without some 
              success, but often left considering 'How do we succinctly explain 
              the personalistic conception to teachers and how can they deliver 
              it in a way accessible to pupils?' This remains for us quite a challenge!<a href="rasafoot.html#30">30</a> 
            <p> Fortunately, help is coming from above! Scholars are beginning 
              to recognise that Vedanta is not the monopoly of the <i>advaitins</i>. 
              For example, Dr. Julius Lipner writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>Many Westerners also believe-alas, this is true for too many 
                of the modern Indian intelligentsia as well-that the great Advaita 
                Shankara is representative of Hindu religious thinkers. Now this 
                belief strikes me as manifestly indefensible... There are other 
                religious thinkers who deserve more than a courteous look in... 
                Ramanuja is one of them. (<i>The Face of Truth</i>, Macmillan 
                1986)<a href="rasafoot.html#31">31</a> 
            </ul>
            <p><b>3. To counteract the general portrayal of the Vedic tradition 
              as primitive and superstitious.</b> 
            <p>The perception and portrayal of India (and indeed the third-world 
              generally) as primitive and superstitious is not confined to the 
              academic or educational world.<a href="rasafoot.html#32">32</a> 
              It is endemic, I suggest, in broader society, with roots in empiricism, 
              hedonism and the quest for affluence. The 'standard of living' is 
              the predominant measure of merit and morality. Simple living, devoid 
              of car and computer, is identified with our cave-dwelling forefathers. 
              Fortunately, ecological and environmental concerns are now challenging 
              many widely held assumptions-the Darwinian construct, for example, 
              by which evolution is external and unidirectional, and God and the 
              soul redundant, relegated to the role of secular religion. 
            <p>And what then <i>is</i> the role of that religion? Could certain 
              elements of Christianity with its world-confirming-or more precisely, 
              world-improving-ethic have helped foster the idea that the third 
              world has little to offer but opportunities for missionary work 
              abroad? Charity advertisements, inadvertently perhaps, reinforce 
              the image of a parched land yielding little to scantily clad natives. 
              More ominously, though, there are school texts, produced by so-called<a href="rasafoot.html#33">33</a> 
              Christians, which intentionally focus on aspects of the Vedic lifestyle 
              predicted to evoke disgust. One book on ISKCON, for example, claimed 
              that members drank cow's urine<a href="rasafoot.html#34">34</a>. 
              Fortunately, most Christians in the RE world these days are far 
              more charitable! Credit must certainly go to such organisations 
              as the CEM (Christian Education Movement), and many RE advisers, 
              teachers and so on, for their valuable efforts in promoting multi-cultural 
              education. 
            <p>Nevertheless, some branches of Christianity, particularly the evangelical, 
              strongly oppose, apparently on moral grounds, the teaching in schools 
              of anything remotely 'supernatural'. Astrology may be branded as 
              the 'work of the devil' and meditation condemned as 'demonology'. 
              The Vedic tradition tends to view subtle phenomena<a href="rasafoot.html#35"> 
              35</a> with far less suspicion and without resorting to unsubstantiated 
              accusations of superstition. (Superstition may be prevalent, in 
              India and elsewhere, but this does not imply that all notions of 
              the paranormal are such, nor that such superstition is completely 
              groundless.) In studying the Western world view then, from both 
              secular (or 'scientific') and religious (or 'faith') perspectives, 
              there seems great commonality in their reluctance to accept anything 
              beyond that which we can see, hear, touch, taste or smell. This 
              we'll discuss further in the next section. 
            <p>How then do some school texts reflect and project a distorted, 
              primitive image of India, its culture and heritage? This will be 
              discussed, somewhat implicitly, in future sections of this article 
              (including objectives 5, 6 and 8) Here a couple of examples will 
              suffice. The first is text, describing the 'Aryan tribes' led by 
              'feudal chieftains'. 
            <ul>
              <p>Originally they were nomadic cattle herdsmen and hunters. The 
                Vedic Aryans worshipped deities who controlled the forces of nature... 
                and domesticated the horse and the cow and used tools of iron, 
                copper and bronze. Their gods were flattered through prayer in 
                order to gain favour.<a href="rasafoot.html#36">36</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Notice the connotations which may reflect poorly on modern Hinduism 
              (e.g. the reference to deity worship). It must be acknowledged that 
              other religions have similar accounts of a tribal past (e.g. Judaism 
              and Christianity<a href="rasafoot.html#37">37</a>) but according 
              to Hindus this portrayal of their heritage is erroneous (as we'll 
              discuss later) and, additionally, there's often the assumption that 
              India hasn't evolved as much as elsewhere. 
            <p>My second example refers not to text, but to illustration. In this 
              case of the Hindu pantheon of gods and goddesses, whose forms too 
              often are depicted as bizarre or comical. Whilst recently reviewing 
              material intended for school use I made the following comments: 
              'Brahma looks more like Attila the Hun with two or three extra heads' 
              and 'Nataraja's anatomy doesn't quite reach human standards what 
              to speak of divine. Besides a general stiffness, his right foot 
              seems to have ended up on the end of his left leg'. Such drawings, 
              had they been published, would have further undermined the integrity 
              and dignity of the Vedic culture. Again this reinforces the need 
              for educationalists to consult faith members who can 'see with the 
              eyes of devotion'. Fortunately the professionals in Religious Education 
              are increasingly eager to receive such feedback. We are optimistic 
              that the sophisticated and theologically-based worship of the <i>arca 
              vigraha</i> (<i>murti </i>or image) will no longer be mistaken for 
              the anthropomorphic<a href="rasafoot.html#38"> 38</a> worship 
              of tribal man! 
            <p><b>4. To promote the study of religion in general (and Hinduism 
              in particular) from the experiential and faith perspective as well 
              as from (or in preference to) the empirical and academic point of 
              view. (Exclusive adherence to the latter approach, which views beliefs 
              and practices only in response to external factors, may undermine 
              the philosophical integrity of a faith).</b> 
            <p>Modern preference for empirical knowledge my lie at the root of 
              any misrepresentation of Vedic tradition. According to Vaishnava 
              thought, exclusive reliance on empiricism suggests lack of faith 
              in the authority of the Supreme. The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> confirms 
              that scholarship without such faith falls within the category of 
              <i>mayaya pahrita jnana</i>-knowledge stolen by illusion. In other 
              words, pride in experimental knowledge to manipulate<a href="rasafoot.html#39">39</a> 
              the world for selfish purposes, concentrated or extended, results 
              in illusion and neglect of spiritual welfare. 
            <p>Such statements may appear to be those of the unsophisticated literalist. 
              Indeed, academics have often interpreted Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, 
              with it's concept of <i>achintya</i><a href="rasafoot.html#40">40</a> 
              (inconceivability), as being anti-intellectual, opposed to the use 
              of rationale, or just downright irrational. In actuality the systematic 
              search for knowledge is not rejected but subsumed to the process 
              of bhakti. Lord Krishna confirms that the ultimate result of knowledge 
              (<i> jnana</i>) is surrender to the authority of the Lord (B.G. 
              7.19). Devotees further explain this, claiming that acceptance of 
              the inconceivability of God, and a subsequent understanding of the 
              need to accept revelationary knowledge to know Him, is in itself 
              rational. This has sometimes been termed 'reasonable faith' as opposed 
              to 'blind faith'. 
            <p>The apparent dichotomy between belief (derived from faith) and 
              knowledge (derived from empirical science) is a particularly Western 
              construct<a
 href="rasafoot.html#41">41</a>-and a biased one. In both cases, for the empiricist 
              and the revelationist, it is a question of faith; specifically, 
              faith in authority, whether it be to guru or orientalist, scripture 
              or scientific thesis. Dr. Kim Knott argues in favour of this: 
            <ul>
              <p>&nbsp;'Faith in the origins of revealed scripture is important 
                to most devotees; dependence on historical 'facts' is important 
                to most scholars of religion. To some extent the issue, both for 
                the devotee and the scholar, becomes one of 'authority'.<a href="rasafoot.html#42">42</a>' 
            </ul>
            <p>This discussion is not to condemn academia but to demonstrate the 
              shortcomings of empiricism within the domain of revealed knowledge. 
              The opinions of those with commitment (so necessary for subjective 
              realisation and effective transmission) may well compliment the 
              objectivity of the dispassionate scholar, provided he or she can 
              maintain objectivity<a href="rasafoot.html#43">43</a> . The problems 
              arise however when the scholar: 
            <ul>
              <p> (a) is biased (as we'll discuss later with regards to the early 
                Indologists.)<br>
                (b) accepts as canonical facts theories presented by others whose 
                methodology is flawed.<br>
                (c) tries to fit a religious tradition into a predetermined conceptual 
                model, often based on philosophical or religious predilections. 
            </ul>
            <p>I'd also add (from the other side, as it were) that the devotee 
              benefits from interaction with the scholar. Such contact encourages 
              reflection and reassessment and prevents complacency, blind literalism 
              and unquestioning allegiance. The RE world in Britain is already 
              appreciating the benefits of mutual interaction between the two 
              communities-professional and confessional. In the recent development 
              of national Model Syllabuses for R.E.<a href="rasafoot.html#44">44</a> 
              representatives of the six principal faiths drew up individual reports, 
              identifying what <i>they</i> would like to see taught in schools. 
              Many consider this a significant watershed, the result of many years 
              development in the philosophy of Religious Education and the methodology 
              of Religious Studies. The phenomenological approach to religion, 
              initiated in Britain in the late '60s by Dr. Ninian Smart, proposes 
              that religion cannot be understood devoid of objectivity and empathy. 
              Religion should not be studied with preconception and bias, nor 
              divorced from the people behind it-their values, attitudes and personal 
              experiences. Particularly significant is the development of 'ethnographic' 
              research, using data obtained from religious practitioners through 
              participant observation, informal chats, focused interviews and 
              so on. Many current schools texts feature quotes from faith members, 
              particularly children<a href="rasafoot.html#45">45 </a>. Above 
              all, teacher and pupil alike are taught to respect the integrity 
              of all faiths. The emphasis on experiential learning, including 
              visits to faith communities, is an integral part of this positive 
              process. 
            <p>How then does adherence to empiricism still visibly colour the 
              presentation of Hinduism? For examples we can refer to standard 
              texts. Conspicuous to devotees is the presentation of theology as 
              a product of social, political and other external forces. Lets consider 
              a couple of passages from <i>The Sacred Cow</i> by A.L. Basham<a href="rasafoot.html#46">46</a> 
              : 
            <ul>
              <p>'Evidently the theistic Vaishnava cult had not long existed at 
                the time of this part of the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and was meeting 
                some opposition: 'The deluded world doesn't recognise Me as unborn 
                and changeless', says Krishna (7.25). 'Fools scorn Me', He says 
                elsewhere 'because I have taken on human form'.' 
            </ul>
            <p>Basham here implies that the author is using philosophical texts 
              as a sophisticated way of name-calling. Furthermore, he adds: 
            <ul>
              <p>'...It is quite clear that the text (of the <i>Gita</i>) is a 
                defence not only of the warrior's duty to wage righteous warfare 
                but also of the whole brahminical social system. This also suggests 
                a date... when Buddhists and other were strongly criticising the 
                doctrine of the four classes and declaring that birth made no 
                difference to a person's fundamental merit and value'. 
            </ul>
            <p>Besides the fallacious nature of this argument, (as evinced by 
              the <i>Gita</i> itself<a href="rasafoot.html#47">47</a>) attributing 
              political motives to the author is unsound both morally and academically. 
              The ultimate result is the undermining of the text's theological 
              credibility-the author's statements are no more respectable than 
              the rhetoric of partisan politicians. Though true revelationalist 
              is not opposed to the appropriate use of rationale, empiricism without 
              faith in the Supreme, or without respect for the opinions of these 
              with such faith, may compound error with offence. Satsvarupa dasa 
              Goswami has written: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Today many scholars continue to minimise the existential and 
                transcendental validity of the Vedas, often without so much as 
                an explanation why empirical knowledge should take preference 
                over <i>sabda,</i> knowledge from authority'.<a href="rasafoot.html#48">48</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> &nbsp;Fortunately with the swing towards more appropriate methodologies, 
              both within religious studies and anthropology, some scholars are 
              beginning to appreciate this, i.e. that there may be profound <i>spiritual</i> 
              forces at work in the development of religion. Dr. Malory Nye writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Furthermore, the sociological forces helping to shape such communities 
                are themselves shaped by other factors such as the desire to reproduce 
                religious traditions and the <i>wish to express devotion</i> '.<a href="rasafoot.html#49">49</a>

            <p><b>5. To demonstrate the influence of the British on Hinduism, 
              especially with reference to the reform movements, and how this 
              may still colour our comprehension of the tradition.</b> 
            <p>Here I'd like to examine how the relationship between Britain and 
              India still colours the Westerners impression of Indian culture. 
              At first British government was careful not to impose any religious 
              constrains upon the Indian people. Indeed the zeal for abolishing 
              'human ignorance' rested not with church leaders or politicians 
              but more with rationalists like Hume and Berkeley, whose influence 
              was significant (as we'll later discuss). Racism, it seems, also 
              played its part. Thus upon his arrival in India in 1813, the governor 
              general marquis of Hastings wrote: 
            <ul>
              <p>'The Hindoo appears a being merely limited to mere animal functions, 
                and even to them indifferent... with no higher intellect than 
                a dog'.<a href="rasafoot.html#50">50</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>This may help us understand the prevalent attitudes of the time. 
              It was only at the beginning of the nineteenth century that, without 
              governmental sanction, the Christian evangelists came 'to India 
              to proselytise and undermine the superstition of the country'<a href="rasafoot.html#51">51</a>. 
              H.H. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>&nbsp;'They did not hesitate to denounce the Vedic literature 
                as 'absurdities' meant 'for the amusement of children'.'<a href="rasafoot.html#52">52</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>When, at around the same period, the first Indologists appeared, 
              considering themselves the 'bearers of Christian light', some grew 
              to admire the Vedic culture. Despite this, stalwarts such as Wilson, 
              Muller and Monier-Williams frankly admitted their preference for 
              European values (often including Christianity) and hastily dismissed 
              Vedic philosophy and 'mythology'. Today's scholars are different, 
              though still a bias remains -not evangelical but empirical-as Satsvarupa 
              dasa Goswami notes: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Vedic scholars... still, largely out of academic habit....give 
                tacit approval to many of the first Indologist's conclusions'.<a href="rasafoot.html#53">53</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Thus their questionable opinions, still quoted as time-honoured 
              facts, remain as cornerstones of the academic world's misconception 
              of Vedic thought. 
            <p>The other significant impact of British rule was on Hindu intelligentsia. 
              To win them over to Euro-centric thought was a deliberate policy 
              instigated by Thomas MaCauley, backed from 1835 with government 
              funds. Jackson and Killingley comment on the effect of British rule 
              in India: 
            <ul>
              <p>'From the beginning of the nineteenth century printed books, 
                periodicals, public lectures and educational institutes began 
                to replace the guru-pupil relationship as ways of transmitting 
                ideas. Hindu ideas were also influenced by contact with the West, 
                especially in Calcutta, which at that time was the main seat of 
                British power in India'.<a href="rasafoot.html#54">54</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> Ironically enough, rather than resorting to Christianity, may 
              Hindu intellectuals turned to rationalism. The most notable developments 
              were the establishment of the Brahmo Samaj by a Bengali, Ram Mohan 
              Roy, and the Arya Samaj by Dayananda. Both attempted to combat degenerate 
              forms of Hinduism but in so doing indiscriminately rejected principles 
              axiomatic to <i>Vaidika-Dharma</i> including worship of the <i>arca-vigraha</i> 
              and acceptance of the devas (demigods). 
            <p> Bhaktivinoda Thakur, the great Gaudiya Vaishnava <i>acharya</i>, 
              comments on another effect of rationalism: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Amongst the scientific beliefs that have come to India along 
                with the British rule, the metaphysical inference that the Deity 
                has no form has been accepted as one of the most philosophical 
                acquisitions that man has ever obtained. The current of the abstruse 
                idea of a formless Brahman, which has invaded thought and worship 
                in India since the time of Pandit Shankaracharya has, with the 
                existence of the European idea of a formless God<a href="rasafoot.html#55">55</a>, 
                become so much extended, especially in the minds of the youngsters 
                of this country, that if an attempt is made to establish the fact 
                that God has external<a href="rasafoot.html#56">56</a> form, 
                it is hooted down as an act of stupidity'.<a href="rasafoot.html#57">57</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>These effects, particularly the bias towards <i>advaita</i>, are 
              still being felt, as Lipner has noted in his introduction to 'The 
              Face of Truth'<a href="rasafoot.html#58"> 58</a> (in the previously 
              quoted passage). Hindu intellectuals, as well as denying the personal 
              conception of God, also disputed the previously unquestionable validity 
              of the scriptures - and still do. For example, Mathoor Krishnamurti, 
              Executive Director of the Bhavan Centre in London, wrote recently 
              in the <i>Gujarat Samachar</i><a href="rasafoot.html#59"><i> 
              </i>59</a> : 
            <ul>
              <p>'I must share with my friends and readers .... the knowledge 
                that I have gleaned from years of research which brought me to 
                the conclusion that Sri Rama ruled 4000 to 5000 years ago.' 
            </ul>
            <p>The letter prompted vehement replies. The secretary of the National 
              Council for Hindu Temples, Mr. Vipin Aery accused the writer of 
              <i>ardha kukkuti nyaya</i>-half-hen logic<a href="rasafoot.html#60">60</a>, 
              referring to the rationalists' habit of picking and choosing which 
              scriptural tenets to accept and which to reject. Aery also attempted 
              to explain the necessity of revealed knowledge over and above the 
              empiric. 
            <ul>
              <p>'While recognising the folly of irrational belief and behaviour, 
                reason itself compels us to accept the inconceivable nature of 
                the Supreme. Our search for truth necessitates us going beyond 
                (though not necessarily against) our limited powers of perception 
                and conception-the very tools of empirical research'.<a href="rasafoot.html#61">61</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>This statement strikes a remarkable resemblance to the arguments 
              directed against Ram Mohan Roy. Lipner confirms: 
            <ul>
              <p>'In debate, his Hindu opponents claimed equally to have used 
                reason to demonstrate reason's rational limitations in defence 
                of many of the so-called superstitions'.<a href="rasafoot.html#62">62</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> It can be safely concluded that many Hindu intellectuals use reason. 
              not only to analyse or interpret Vedic texts, but to deny their 
              statements and to denigrate the apparently superstitious aspects 
              of their own faith. In one Hinduism textbook, for example, the author 
              opines: 
            <ul>
              <p>'In Hinduism, pollution means <i>ritual</i> impurity and has 
                little or nothing to do with <i>actual</i> physical or chemical 
                contamination's.'<a href="rasafoot.html#63">63</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Caste abuse notwithstanding, is there not valid reason behind some 
              concepts of purity and pollution? Why, for example, does the relative 
              of a recently deceased Hindu undergo a predetermined period of 'impurity'? 
              Scholars may well benefit by seeking to understand the theological/ 
              philosophical principles underpinning these practices. These topics, 
              though, are difficult to comprehend without understanding the science 
              of the soul and the process of transmigration. This may be the crux 
              of the matter.<a href="rasafoot.html#64">64</a> 
            <p><b>6. To redress the exclusive adherence to modern empiricism to 
              date the history and development of Hinduism, neglecting to mention 
              the opinions of the tradition itself</b> 
            <p>This objective is closely related to number four, which we've already 
              discussed at length. Here, though, we'll focus on the history of 
              Hinduism and how it's presented in schools. Most texts propound 
              standard theory, including mention of the Indus Valley Civilisation, 
              (largely based on archaeological evidence from two walled cities, 
              Mohenjo-daro and Harappa) and the subsequent Aryan invasion. Whether 
              or not there is truth in these hypothetical claims, the general 
              portrayal of progressive evolution from tribal status to modern 
              Hindu runs contrary to the Vedic paradigm of eternal, cyclical and 
              degenerative time. What has concerned Hindus has not been so much 
              the <i>inclusion</i> of empirical theory (usually termed historical 
              facts) but the <i>exclusion</i> of any mention of the tradition's 
              own opinions. 
            <p>It is encouraging to note that the recently published Model Agreed 
              Syllabuses for RE, included in the Hinduism Working Party report, 
              a section on 'The Nature of Time', recommending study of 'traditional 
              views relating to the four yugas' and 'the nature of the present 
              age'<a href="rasafoot.html#65">65</a> . This is perceived by 
              many as a significant step in the right direction. 
            <p>About the influence of early British scholars, Satsvarupa dasa 
              Goswami has written: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Sir William Jones... drew fire from the eminent British historian 
                James Mill for his 'hypothesis of a high state of civilisation'. 
                Typically, Mill believed that the people of India never had been 
                advanced and that therefore their claim to a glorious past (which 
                some of the early Indologists supported) was historical fantasy.'<a href="rasafoot.html#66">66</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Some Hindu intellectuals, though, have tried to establish the validity 
              of their claim, using empiric techniques. They have countered the 
              more recent dates which scholars generally attribute to scriptural 
              compilation and historical events. Shri Kshitish Chandra De, for 
              example, has authored one dissertation aimed to determine the period 
              of the Kurukshetra war.<a href="rasafoot.html#67">67</a> In his 
              book <a href="rasafoot.html#68">68</a>, he cites scriptural, 
              archaeological and astronomical<a href="rasafoot.html#69">69</a> 
              evidence to conclude that the fratricidal war was fought in 3137 
              B.C.E., only two years at variance with the traditionally accepted 
              date. Some scientists have also claimed to have found evidence of 
              nuclear blasts occurring thousands of years ago. These arguments 
              may be somewhat tenuous but interesting in the light of Srila Prabhupada's 
              commentary on the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>: 
            <ul>
              <p>'The <i>brahmastra</i> is similar to the modern nuclear weapon 
                manipulated by atomic energy... but the difference is that the 
                atomic bomb is a gross type of nuclear weapon, whereas the <i>brahmastra</i> 
                is a subtle type of weapon produced by chanting hymns'.<a href="rasafoot.html#70">70</a> 
            </ul>
            <p><i>Shastra</i> thus confirms the claims of these scientists, (whose 
              research, however, remains highly speculative). Still, the hypothesis 
              of cyclical time, suggesting previous high levels of civilisation 
              is not unreasonable. On the contrary, it seems that the notion of 
              linear time, and other corollaries, are central to the Westerners 
              general difficulty in grasping Vedic knowledge-and, indeed, spiritual 
              life at all. 
            <p><b>7. To establish understanding and appreciation of the principles 
              behind the original caste system, i.e. <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i>.</b> 
            <p>Caste-as used in the terms caste-system-is a word derived from 
              the Portuguese<a href="rasafoot.html#71">71</a> and is equivalent 
              to the Indian vernacular term <i>jati</i>. It refers to 'structurally 
              distinct hereditary communities, differentiated not only by occupation 
              but by their degree of ritual purity in relation to one another'.<a href="rasafoot.html#72">72</a> 
              It does not specifically refer to varna, but to sub-divisions, though 
              it is naturally related to it on the basis of its hereditary and 
              hierarchical structure. In delineating objective seven above, I've 
              equated caste-system with <i>Varnashrama,</i> both for the sake 
              of brevity and because colloquially the term is used to refer to 
              the system of both <i>varnas</i> and <i>jatis</i>. 
            <p>The caste system is understandably notorious, not least for the 
              work of Gandhi in protecting the interests of the untouchables, 
              whom he called '<i>Harijans</i>'<a href="rasafoot.html#73">73</a> 
              . It is therefore a struggle, particularly with the popular egalitarian 
              ethic, to establish the validity of <i>Varnashrama</i>. However, 
              taking into account modern sentiment, ISKCON devotees would be expedient 
              in explaining the subject with reference to Lord Caitanya's defiance 
              of the rigid and perverse caste system. ISKCON's often predominantly 
              non-Asian (and hence 'untouchable') membership is a powerful living 
              example of opposition to hereditary and exploitative caste consciousness. 
              As mentioned earlier, Srila Prabhupada defines ISKCON's tradition 
              in terms of <i>Sanatana Dharma</i> and <i>Varnashrama Dharma</i>. 
              To establish the integrity of the original system is therefore crucial 
              in promoting the Society's reputable heritage. One way that we may 
              do this is by promoting the use of the term 'non-caste <i>brahmin</i>', 
              as applicable to ISKCON's initiated priests. 
            <p><b>8. To abolish other misconceptions about practices which fall 
              under 'dismissive designations' such as untouchabiltiy, ritual purity

              the Hindu pantheon, the sacred cow, etc.</b> 
            <p>The above mentioned 'dismissive designations' are so called since 
              they often evoke immediate rejection, without consideration of any 
              underlying principle. One reason for this is widespread malpractice. 
              Although it is fallacious to reject a practice wholesale on account 
              of its degeneration, this often seems the case<a href="rasafoot.html#74">74</a> 
              . In 1991, members of the National Council for Hindu Temples expressed 
              to me the desire that in British schools less attention be given 
              to such contentious issues as mentioned above. Their response, though 
              understandable, reminded me of the reaction of the Reform Movements. 
              It would be better, I suggested, to address these issues and, where 
              appropriate, explain the rationale behind them. Devotees making 
              presentations to schools should also be prepared to address these 
              issues. 
            <p>I believe there is a second reason for which malpractice, though 
              factual in itself, serves as a convenient smokescreen. It is the 
              issue of our world view, our model of reality, that which discerns 
              what is acceptable and what to reject. A short anecdote would be 
              in order here. One evening whilst showing a couple of teacher friends 
              around our new cowshed at Bhaktivedanta Manor, the cowherdsman kindly 
              offered us some fresh milk. We politely consented. As we stood there 
              holding the warm liquid in stainless steel bowls, we glanced at 
              each other, somewhat nervous, but sensing the profundity of the 
              moment. We explored our emotional and cognitive responses. 'What! 
              It came from where? Hasn't it been pasteurised? It's still warm! 
              Does it have lumps in?' After enjoying what turned out to be a delicious 
              drink, we realised not only where milk originates (including the 
              stuff in bottles) but how much we were out-of-touch with nature. 
              Moreover, though, we had the direct experience of the inadequacies 
              of trying to appreciate practices of one culture through the eyes 
              of another. 
            <p>In this light, let us consider one of the above issues -child marriage. 
              There have undoubtedly been unspeakable social aberrations, sometimes 
              to secure sizeable dowries. Despite this there is within Vedic dharma 
              a system of betrothal<a href="rasafoot.html#75">75</a>, often 
              from an early age. Actual marriage would never take place till shortly 
              after puberty. Even then we Westerners are usually abhorred. Teenage 
              girls freely mixing with boys, with every possibility of premature 
              pregnancy and so on, poses little problem, but marriage (what to 
              speak of arranged marriage) appears unmistakably barbaric. There 
              are, Vaishnavas claim, sound socio-theological reasons for early 
              marriage, as Srila Prabhupada explains in one lecture<a href="rasafoot.html#76">76 
              </a> referring to his mother, wife and daughter, who were all married 
              at an early age. It must be noted, though, that any practice cannot 
              be literally translated or transposed in its entirety from one milieu 
              to another without considering the principles underpinning it.<a href="rasafoot.html#77">77</a> 
              For this reason, educationalists often stress that 'religious beliefs' 
              and 'religious practices' should not be taught as discreet units 
              but constantly interrelated throughout the learning process. 
            <p><b>9. To promote the prominence of certain historical figures. 
              These would include Madhva, Ramanuja and Caitanya, perhaps mentioning 
              the latter's contribution as a social reformer (though He appeared 
              well before the modern reform movements of the 19th and 20th Centuries). 
              In more recent history we could include the names of Bhaktivinoda, 
              Bhaktisiddhanta and Srila Prabhupada.</b> 
            <p>I originally included this point after reading one school text 
              book<a href="rasafoot.html#78">78</a> which stated: 
            <ul>
              <p>'There is no one messenger, or even a group of men, to whom Hinduism 
                can look with any certainly and identify as the people through 
                whom God revealed Himself. Seven <i>rishis</i> or wise men are 
                mentioned in the ancient myths of Hinduism, but no details of 
                their lives are known...' 
            </ul>
            <p>Thereafter the text refers only to 'Brahmins' and 'Gurus', without 
              mentioning specific names. After explaining their roles, it continues: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Perhaps because these [current] guides can be so important in 
                the everyday life of a Hindu, historical figures of the past have 
                never acquired the significance of men like Moses, Siddhartha 
                or Jesus'. 
            </ul>
            <p>This latter statement seems quite contentious, raising several 
              pertinent questions. In this case, though, I don't doubt the co-author's 
              intentions as both are well-respected, sympathetic towards multi-religious 
              education and experts in the underlying methodology. What is important 
              to note is that, despite their credentials, this section of the 
              book is inadequate, highlighting the unique challenge which Hinduism 
              presents. The tradition has neither a definite starting point (if 
              indeed one at all) nor a single founder. What's more, by mentioning 
              leaders significant to one tradition one may omit these revered 
              by another. In addition, as hinted in the text above, one needs 
              to choose between ancient seers, more recent leaders and the current 
              proliferation of gurus and swamis. The often amorphous divide between 
              human and immortal further complicates the issue. And yet, accounting 
              for local variations of worship and <i>sampradayic</i> affiliations, 
              it's not an impossible task, though one which certainly requires 
              more research. 
            <p>In the above mentioned list, I have not mentioned Shankara, although 
              naturally he should be included in any in-depth study of Hinduism. 
              I have already mentioned the natural leaning towards impersonalism, 
              and thus Madhva and Ramanuja should be included alongside him. In 
              connection with the great Gaudiya Vaishnava acharyas, as mentioned, 
              I anticipate that as ISKCON develops, they will naturally receive 
              the attention of academics and scholars, particularly if we can 
              offer them assistance in their studies. Meanwhile, in schools and 
              colleges we can mention their significant contributions in preserving 
              and promoting the Vedic religion. 
            <p>I have omitted Lord Krishna from this list as He shouldn't be regarded 
              as simply a historic figure. Still, amongst the great, His person 
              cannot be overlooked-not only from the Vaishnava theological stance 
              but in terms of popularity amongst the Hindu community (particularly 
              in the U.K.<a href="rasafoot.html#79">79</a>) His exalted position 
              is confirmed by Dr. Harvey Cox:<a href="rasafoot.html#80">80</a> 
            <ul>
              <p>'Someone once called India the 'land of a million gods'. But 
                if there's one divinity who excels all others in pre-eminence 
                and beauty, it is surely the sky-blue Lord Krishna, the bejewelled 
                flute player....' 
            </ul>
            <p><b>10. To demonstrate the relevance of the Vedic scriptures to 
              personal, social and moral education and the issues it raises such 
              as health, the environment, violence etc</b> 
            <p>This last objective presents perhaps the greatest challenge to 
              ISKCON, not just to departments involved with schools<a href="rasafoot.html#81">81</a> 
              or colleges, but to the Society as a whole. As ISKCON evolves from 
              mainly monastic (and somewhat wary of the world) to more congregational 
              (and judicially affirmative) its predominant role will become supportive 
              rather then prescriptive.<a href="rasafoot.html#82"> 82</a> This 
              necessitates development of a pastoral theology, translating doctrine 
              into positive and practical action. In this vein, for the Communications 
              Department Mukunda Maharaja<a href="rasafoot.html#83">83</a> 
              has established a 'Universal Mission Statement' which begins: 
            <ul>
              <p>'The Hare Krishna Movement benefits the individual and society 
                by offering practical solutions to today's material and spiritual 
                problems.<a href="rasafoot.html#84">'84</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>The Asian population faces its own challenges. In the West, largely 
              through tensions created by acculturation, the Hindu community is 
              questioning its collective identity. In the context of British Hindus 
              establishing their own communities, Malory Nye has written: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Also the notion of a shared religion-that is, Hinduism itself-is 
                being constructed in this process'.<a href="rasafoot.html#85"> 
                85</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Many Hindus are questioning and reassessing their own tradition. 
              There are indications, particularly with its work amongst the Asian 
              youth, that ISKCON may become the predominant voice for post-modern 
              Hinduism<a href="rasafoot.html#86">86</a> . It is certainly a 
              possibility which devotees cannot ignore. Nor are scholars unaware, 
              as Basham confirms: 
            <ul>
              <p>'Hinduism is once more becoming - quietly perhaps, but very definitely-an 
                expansive missionary religion taking in people from all over the 
                world....Now, the culmination of this process so far, is that 
                represented by the followers of the Hare Krishna Movement. Here 
                for the first time since the days of the Roman Empire, is a new 
                Asian religion-that is to say, an Asian religion new to the Western 
                world-being practised by people of Western race and Judeo-Christian 
                background. It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty 
                years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is 
                a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the 
                Western world'.<a href="rasafoot.html#87">87</a>
