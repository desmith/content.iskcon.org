              A. Beckford </b></a> 
            <p><i>This article represents a very interesting analysis of the relationship 
              between the mass media and new religious movements. Although many 
              Vaishnavas and Hindus would have an understandable difficulty in 
              referring to ISKCON as a new religion, it must be conceded that, 
              from a sociological perspective, Vaishnavism is new to Western culture 
              and as such this article is of interest to ISKCON's members. The 
              Western response to ISKCON is certainly worthy of study, although 
              it may be deemed more appropriate to study ISKCON as an established 
              religious movement which has been transplanted in the West. A study 
              of the subject from that perspective, which balances knowledge of 
              the individual traditions now lumped together as 'new religions', 
              would certainly lead to a greater understanding of the issues involved 
              for the host cultures perspective but also for the perspectives 
              of alternative and culturally different worldviews.</i>  
            <p><b>Introduction<br>
              </b>One of the reasons cited by some rationalists for their dislike 
              of religion is that it is apparently inseparable from violent conflict 
              (Candland, 1992). The history of religious wars in Europe and Latin 
              America in particular has often served as a justification for abandoning 
              religion altogether. Many heirs of the various Enlightenments have 
              confidently believed that the demise of religious belief and practice 
              would entail a lessening of social conflict. It follows that religion 
              was not expected to be a source of conflict in a largely secular 
              society. But I want to argue, on the contrary, that the very opposite 
              has occurred in countries where reported levels of religious beliefs 
              and belonging have been declining for many decades but where unconventional 
              new religious movements have developed. 
            <p>My argument will be that some aspects of religion have become more 
              controversial and conflictual for the very reason that general levels 
              of religious understanding and practice are so low. Unconventional 
              forms of religion have become especially problematic at a time when 
              large numbers of people find even the most conventional religion 
              alien. In these circumstances, it is the new and unusual kinds of 
              religious groups which encounter most hostility. In their turn, 
              these controversial groups have sometimes exacerbated matters by 
              responding with even more hostility towards their detractors. This 
              vicious spiral has occasionally erupted into massive conflicts and 
              bloodshed. Jonestown in 1978 and Waco in 1993 are the most tragic 
              examples. But I believe that there are also echoes of this process 
              to be heard in the suspicions frequently voiced by the nominally 
              Christian public in the UK about non Christian minorities. Tariq 
              Modood's (1994) characterisation of this phenomenon as ,cultural 
              racism' is challenging but not unproblematic. I shall focus this 
              paper, however, on the part played by journalists in conflicts involving 
              so-called cults, i.e. those new religious movements (NRMS) which 
              have been outstandingly controversial since their emergence in the 
              West in the 1960s. A central theme will be that there are connections 
              between the low-level prejudice displayed against so-called cults 
              in everyday journalism and the spectacular outbreaks of conflict 
              which occur from time to time around controversial NRMS. 
            <p><b>Controversial Cults<br>
              </b>It is not difficult to see why many of the NRMs which emerged 
              in the USA and Western Europe in the 1960s, such as Scientology, 
              the Unification Church ('Moonies'), the International Society for 
              Krishna Consciousness ('Hare Krishna') and the Children of God (now 
              called 'the Family'), quickly became controversial. Firstly, the 
              simple fact that so many of them seemed to arrive at roughly the 
              same time was enough to persuade some people that a new 'invasion 
              of the body snatchers' had occurred. Secondly, the movements which 
              drew on Asian philosophies and cultures tended to arouse suspicions 
              merely for being foreign and therefore perceived as threatening. 
              Thirdly, the people who were targeted by the new movements were 
              mainly young, relatively well educated, middle-class students. They 
              were not down-and-outs or obviously deprived. This meant that their 
              aggrieved relatives and former friends tended to have the money, 
              connections and confidence required to make their complaints heard 
              in centres of influence and power, at least at local levels. 
            <p>The list of complaints voiced against controversial NRMs grew so 
              long that anti-cult organisations began to emerge in the early 1970s 
              to combat what they considered to be a major menace to young people. 
              Allegations of economic exploitation, mental cruelty, the deliberate 
              alienation of recruits from their families, deceptive recruiting 
              practices, harmful diets and life-styles, sexual abuse and, of course, 
              brainwashing were widespread. The high-water mark of anti-cult feeling 
              probably occurred in the late 1970s following the death of more 
              than 900 followers of the Revd. Jim Jones at Jonestown, Guyana. 
              This was also the period of the most rapid growth in membership 
              of the most notorious cults. 
            <p>Yet, for all the hostility and suspicion expressed towards NRMs 
              at that time, only a tiny proportion of the population of any Western 
              country had ever had any direct contact with any of the movements. 
              Of course, some people came to know about them in the course of 
              trying to 'rescue' relatives or friends from the movements' clutches. 
              But very few people attended NRM meetings or read their literature. 
              Nevertheless, the movements' notoriety was confirmed many times 
              by opinion polls which showed cult leaders to be among the most 
              strongly disliked celebrities of their time. 
            <p>My own research into cult controversies was able to confirm that 
              even people directly affected by NRMs relied for their information 
              overwhelmingly on the mass media. Very few people managed or tried 
              to contact the movements directly. Instead, they preferred to contact 
              journalists who had published stories about the movements. Indeed, 
              given the secretiveness or defensiveness of most controversial cults, 
              some journalists came to play a crucial role as go-betweens and 
              arbitrators between NRMS, their members and angry outsiders. Only 
              ex-members could rival the privileged position of a few investigative 
              journalists; but most ex-members were understandably reluctant to 
              talk freely about their former commitments. In these circumstances, 
              the role of groups in the anti-cult movement (ACW has assumed significant 
              proportions (Beckford, 1985; Bromley &amp; Shupe, 1993). Cult controversies 
              cannot be properly understood unless the symbiotic relationship 
              between these anti-cult groups and journalists is taken into account. 
            <p><b> The Anti-Cult Movement<br>
              </b>Some anti-cult movement organisations have become influential 
              and materially secure over the past twenty years. They are now powerful 
              enough to have the sympathetic ear of politicians, leading church 
              representatives and sections of the medical and psychiatric establishments. 
              National-level organisations have consolidated themselves, and cross-national 
              Links are slowly emerging. In short, today's ACM is much more substantial 
              and effective than its predecessors in the continuous struggle between 
              mainstream and marginal versions of Christianity'. Moreover, Jehovah's 
              Witnesses and Christian Scientists, for example, have always been 
              the target of critical attacks mounted by representatives of mainstream 
              churches, and these large sectarian organisations have also had 
              to contend with the aggressive criticism that disgruntled ex members 
              have showered on them. Yet, these 'established sects' (Yinger, 1970) 
              have never had to cope with the incessant barrage of highly public 
              and politicised attacks that the ACM now routinely directs against 
              NRMS. 
            <p>The fact that the ACM's dismissal of NRMs is not based on primarily 
              theological considerations and that the aim is not to convert members 
              into mainstream Christians enhances the movement's appeal to journalists. 
              The latter find the ACM useful precisely because it attacks the 
              very existence and <i>modus operandi </i>of NRMs without drawing 
              on doctrinal issues. It is actually <i>common</i> for the ACM's 
              activists to disclaim any 'religious' intent or any animus against 
              religion as such. They prefer the strategy of exposing alleged illegality 
              and exploitation in NRM's. In other words, the critics' aim is to 
              disqualify 'cults' from the category of 'religion' altogether, thereby 
              framing problems as 'economic', 'political' or 'psychological'. 
            <p>As I argued earlier, part of the success of the ACM is due to the 
              high degree of religious illiteracy or the simple lack of familiarity 
              with things religious among the nominally Christian sections of 
              most advanced industrial societies in the West. It can therefore 
              trade on fear of the unknown at a time when so few young adults 
              have any experience of 'normal' religion with which they can statistically 
              compare NRMS. As a result, it is not difficult to catch the popular 
              imagination with allegations of a sci-fi nature about the supposedly 
              weird and dangerous goings-on inside cults. Journalists find this 
              approach to NRMs virtually irresistible, even though, according 
              to McDonnell (1994: 92) 'Religion does not fit easily into the dominant 
              world-view of most contemporary broadcasters who are often ill prepared 
              to deal with religion, being indifferent, or occasionally, actively 
              hostile'. At least, sensational stories about NRMs require no knowledge 
              of religion on the part of their audience. The focus on the non 
              religious aspects of the movements means that there is no need to 
              tackle issues of religious belief or experience. And the parallels 
              that are emphasised with stories of fraud and exploitation in politics, 
              business and crime provide the audience with a recognisable script. 
              In short, the ACM presents journalists with material which needs 
              very little adaptation before it can be easily digested by audiences 
              with no taste for religion-let alone religious controversies. In 
              this sense, it is not difficult for journalists to deal with religion 
              (page McDonnell, 1994), especially when they concentrate on expressions 
              of religion which challenge conventional ideas or practices. Indeed, 
              the very controversial character of some religious phenomena makes 
              the journalists' life relatively easy in so far as conflict can 
              easily be made to serve as the thematic 'line' of a story. Thus, 
              although journalists may feel uncomfortable having to report on, 
              for example, angry protests against publication of <i> The Satanic 
              Verses</i> which call their own professional objectivity into question, 
              the story-line conforms readily with the 'script' of social and 
              cultural conflicts. 
            <p>I shall now analyses with examples, the ways in which the mass 
              media's tendency to portray NRMs as controversial helps to generate 
              and perpetuate conflict. 
            <p><b>The Portrayal of NRMs in the Mass Media<br>
              </b>&nbsp; 
            <p><i>1. Conflict and news-worthiness<br>
              </i>The most elementary observation about print and broadcast media's 
              portrayal of NRMs is that the movements' activities are newsworthy 
              only when conflicts are involved. In the quarter of a century that 
              I have been studying NRMs in W. Europe, N. America and Japan I have 
              rarely found articles or programmes which did not use conflict as 
              (a) the main occasion for the portrayal and (b) as the principal 
              means of structuring the account. Even those accounts which aspire 
              towards a balanced, i.e. two-sided, presentation of the issues tend 
              nevertheless to allow the conflictual aspects to predominate. 'Cults 
              are problematic' must be the long-term effect on audiences of exposure 
              to this type of journalism. The audience very rarely has the opportunity 
              to receive information about NRMs which is unrelated to conflict. 
              The movements are only in the news when conflict is involved; and 
              conflict concerning one-e movement is pounced on as an excuse for 
              investigating all the others. The aftermath of Waco was full of 
              stories along the lines of the <i>Boston Globe </i>'s 'If you think 
              Waco, Texas was bad, consider who could be next' (quoted by Maffett, 
              1994: 159). 
            <p>These stories about the so-called cult menace are as much about 
              speculation as about news. They use events relating to one particular 
              movement as a platform from which to launch 'scare' stories about 
              the possible threat that the entire category of cults represents 
              for other people in other places. This was an especially noticeable 
              feature of reporting in W. European papers about the siege at Waco. 
              In the absence day after day of new facts about the Branch Davidians 
              journalists from various places turned to the questions of whether 
              a comparable problem could occur in their own countries and whether 
              the authorities ought to be taking pre-emptive steps to avert such 
              a possibility. Opinions were divided, but my impression was that 
              the view which prevailed, on balance, was that the problem of armed 
              cultists was a uniquely American phenomenon. Nevertheless, there 
              was also a strong note of warning against the risk of allowing a 
              similar conflict to develop in European countries. Vigilance was 
              the order of the day. The virtual globalisation of mass communications 
              thereby helps journalists to frame NRMs as primarily conflictual 
              even in countries where the movements are unknown or unproblematic. 
            <p><i>2. Conflict as the Leitmotiv<br>
              </i>Conflict is the Leitmotiv which connects journalistic portrayals 
              of NRMs together. This is evident in the extensive use that journalists 
              and programme producers make of the 'negative summary event' ( Rosengren, 
              Arvidsson. &amp; Sturesson, 1978; Beckford, 1985). This is the practice 
              of creating continuity between episodic (especially slow moving) 
              stories by adding a capsule summary of the negative features of 
              the phenomenon in focus. This reminds the audience of the sequence 
              of reported events into which the current story can be slotted. 
              It also stamps a particular 'mood' on the story even if the very 
              latest episode has not been primarily about conflict. 
            <p><i>3. Cross-references to conflict<br>
              </i>A third aspect of the journalistic construction of cult conflicts 
              is that stories are frequently cross-references to other mass media 
              items. TV programmes, for example, use still shots of newspaper 
              and magazine headlines as devices for <i>emphasising</i> shock and 
              horror. Similarly, the still photographs of cult leaders which are 
              sometimes used in TV programmes are shown staring out of the pages 
              of the print media. Presumably the intention is to try to enhance 
              the sense of realism and veracity by showing that stories about 
              a particular NRM or leader have already appeared in the print media 
              and must therefore be true. Since the information and images that 
              are 'quoted' in this way between different stories and/or media 
              tend to be overwhelmingly unflattering and critical, the effect 
              is likely to reinforce the generally negative image of NRMs. In 
              turn, this hardens public opinion against the movements and fuels 
              the anti-cult campaigns. 
            <p>An allied feature of the reporting of cult-related conflicts in 
              which the journalists have difficulty gaining access to relevant 
              material is that they tend to substitute their own operation for 
              the ostensibly central subject. This was especially clear in the 
              case of Waco where access to the Branch Davidian compound was denied 
              to journalists. The focus of many stories therefore became the media 
              circus on the compound's perimeter. The fact that so many journalists 
              were present seemed to guarantee the importance of the event at 
              moments when nothing significant seemed to be happening. Writing 
              stories about the stories being written by other journalists took 
              the place of direct reports on the siege of the Branch Davidians. 
              Perhaps this practice also helps journalists to cope with the competition 
              for customers between different publications or programmes. They 
              can keep a story running despite the lack of directly relevant material. 
            <p><i>4. Conflict feeds on stories of conflict <br>
              </i>The next point is that, just as anti-cult activists commonly 
              supply journalists with negative copy about NRM's, the hostile depiction's 
              of the movements in the mass media are then recycled as further 
              evidence in anti-cult propaganda campaigns . There is in fact a 
              mutually beneficial and reinforcing dynamic at work. It is difficult 
              for NRM leaders or for disinterested parties to break into this 
              cosy circle in order to challenge or correct the dominant imagery. 
              Given the public's heavy reliance on the mass media for information 
              about unconventional religion, the close alliance between the ACMs 
              and journalists makes it difficult for non-controversial and favourable 
              material about NRMs to be published or broadcast. The logic of suspicion 
              which turns many investigative journalists into allies of the ACM 
              helps to set the scene for the official agents of control. Knowing 
              that the public has a very poor opinion of NRMS, largely as a result 
              of stereotyping in the mass media, police officers are not taking 
              much of a risk if they take high-handed action against these unpopular 
              movements. Journalists function as the principal gatekeepers of 
              public opinion especially on matters with which the person-in-the-street 
              is not normally familiar. Their overwhelmingly critical portrayal 
              of the movements can therefore contribute indirectly towards the 
              latter's control. Indeed, as many informed commentators on the <i>debacle</i> 
              at Waco have pointed out, the FBI, the US Department of Justice, 
              journalists and programme maker all tended to favour the testimony 
              of psychological experts whose anti-cult views were well known in 
              advance. One of the many scandalous aspects of the whole affair 
              was the studied refusal to give credence to the testimony of sociological, 
              anthropological, historical and theological experts on controversial 
              NRMS. It is unlikely that any of these scholars with first-hand 
              experience of researching these movements in their natural settings 

              over many years would have supported the strategy and tactics adopted 
              by the Bureau of Arms, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) and the FBI. 
              Instead, credence was selectively given to opinions rooted in individualistic 
              abnormal psychology. This is always newsworthy, as was shown by 
              the fascination with the psychological condition of David Koresh. 
              By contrast, the strictly social dynamics of exclusive, high-demand 
              religious groups and the cultural force of apocalyptic millennialism 
              were deliberately screened out of the mass media coverage. 
            <p><i>5. Conflicts, journalists and control<br>
              </i>If the mass media portrayals of NRM'S, based mainly on the one-sided 
              evidence supplied by activists in the ACM, are sufficiently numerous 
              and disturbing, there is a strong probability that social control 
              agents will have to be seen to respond. 
            <p>Legislators and police officials in particular find themselves 
              under pressure to say what they intend to do about the alleged wrongdoing 
              and outrages perpetrated by cults. 'Could Jonestown happen in Britain?' 
              or 'What are you doing to prevent another Waco happening here?' 
              are the kind of questions put with monotonous frequency to officials 
              in the wake of those two tragedies. Journalists seem not to be interested 
              in the specific circumstances which led to such spectacular disasters. 
              Instead, all the emphasis is on the <i>presumed and unquestioned 
              </i>resemblance between the People's Temple or the Branch Davidians 
              and cults in the UK. The authorities are forced to respond to these 
              leading questions and are not given the opportunity to express doubts 
              or reservations about the practice of 'lumping all cults together' 
              (Barker, 1989). 
            <p>This dramatisation of the situation increases public nervousness 
              and official defensiveness, neither of which is conducive to clear 
              thinking and fairness. There is a danger, then, that inadvisable, 
              panic reactions may follow. In the case of the Branch Davidians, 
              for example, the ante at Waco was upped because of the intervention 
              of television reporting. Lives were endangered because the story 
              line was created and embedded in a pernicious dualism which legitimated 
              the 'authorities' and discouraged unconventional perspectives and 
              opinions. The shared mentality-the corporate mentality-was served 
              as the cultural mainstream [and] was reinforced, not challenged. 
            <p> Waco's Branch Davidians, then, were victims of a media-induced 
              disaster, executed before the eyes of the nation on television. 
              The polarisation that led to the catastrophe at Waco was inherent 
              in neither the religious group itself-nor even in the FBI. (Jones 
              &amp; Baker, 1994: 151) 
            <p>Numerous commentators have blamed the Editor of the <i>Waco Tribune-Herald</i> 
              for running the full episode of a hard-hitting expose of the Branch 
              Davidians immediately prior to the BATF's assault on the compound. 
              This allegedly broke an agreement with the BATF to withhold publication; 
              and it probably forced the Bureau to take its ill-conceived action 
              earlier than it had intended. On the other hand, it seems that the 
              FBI placed considerably tighter restrictions on journalists covering 
              the siege than is normal in similar events. In other words, the 
              trade-off between journalists and authorities worked to the greater 
              advantage of the latter. Not enough attention has been given to 
              the consequences of sensationalist depiction's of religion in a 
              secular age. To adapt the old adage, I am not trying to kill the 
              messenger for bringing bad news but I <i>am</i> accusing the messenger 
              of fermenting mischief by relentlessly peddling negative stereotypes 
              of NRMS. 
            <p><i>6. One conflict can hide another<br>
              </i>Journalists' fascination with the tragedies of Jonestown and 
              Waco stemmed not only from the exotic and improbable details of 
              the two community's ways of life but also from the suspicion that 
              the cult controversies were only the tip of the iceberg. Investigative 
              journalists had a field day with their inquiries into the possibility 
              either that people in authority had bungled the operations to prevent 
              loss of life and/or that attempts had been made afterwards to cover 
              up the errors made by the forces of order. In other words, cult-related 
              conflicts could be connected with broader concerns about the use 
              and misuse of state power. 
            <p>Other examples of stories linking cults with conflicts against 
              the state include the bombing by police of the anarcho-ecology group, 
              MOVE, in Philadelphia; the killing by police in 1983 of all six 
              followers of Lindberg Sanders, a self-styled 'Black Jesus', in a 
              shoot-out in Memphis; and various armed assaults on dissident Mormons 
              in Utah. The result is usually a polarisation of journalistic and 
              public opinion between, on the one hand, the view that agents of 
              the state acted negligently or illegally and, on the other, the 
              view that the same agents should have acted more decisively to suppress 
              the movement in question before the problem had become unmanageable 
              by peaceful means. But both cases illustrate the more general point 
              that it is invariably the conflicts associated with NRMs which make 
              them newsworthy even when responsibility for the conflicts is attributed 
              to the state. 
            <p>An interesting twist on this theme quickly emerged in European 
              print-media accounts of Waco. The long and slow-moving story of 
              the siege provided an opportunity for journalists to investigate 
              in depth the issues of gun ownership and control in the USA. In 
              fact, the amount of attention devoted to this context of the action 
              taken against the Branch Davidians sometimes outweighed reports 
              of events at Waco. The conflictual image of cults was thereby reinforced 
              by linking them with a separate conflict about firearms. One conflict 
              was 'nested' in another. 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>This is not the place to analyse in detail the full repertoire 
              of journalistic devices for depicting NRMS. Elsewhere I have summarised 
              the tendency for the mass media to characterise or caricature the 
              movements as threatening, strange, exploitative, oppressive and 
              provocative (Beckford, 1985). A content analysis of selected British 
              print-media between 1975 and 1985 showed how this sensationalist 
              approach helps to cement the public perception of cults as, at best, 
              weird and, at worst, destructive (Beckford &amp; Cole, 1988). There 
              is strong confirmation of this analysis from the USA (van Driel 
              &amp; Richardson, 1988a, 1988b). 
            <p>On the other hand, it is clear that the reasons for the biased 
              presentation of NRMs in the mass media are rooted in commercial 
              pressures, cultural stereotypes and the lack of time for journalists 
              to take a more nuanced and longer-term view of the movements (Beckford, 
              1994). It should also be recognised that some journalists have exposed 
              the criminal activities of a few cult leaders and have therefore 
              been helpful in checking abuses (Mitchell, Mitchell &amp; Ofshe, 
              1980). Indeed, the public is heavily dependent on the mass media 
              for information about unconventional and sometimes secretive religious 
              movements. My purpose is definitely not to denigrate these positive 
              benefits of investigative journalism, for a healthy democracy depends 
              in part on a combative press. 
            <p>At the same time, however, it seems to me that the public is right 
              to expect that journalists should be more methodical, discriminating, 
              careful and open-minded than they normally are when it comes to, 
              portraying NRMS. Their knee-jerk categorisation of the movements 
              as problematic and conflictual is not only prejudiced and lazy but 
              it also feeds directly into public ignorance and a less than even-handed 
              attitude towards the movements on the part of social control agencies. 
              The cosy relationship that many journalists have with the ACM can 
              be an excuse for them not to do their research properly.

            <p>My analysis is based partly on a systematic scrutiny of print-media 
              items about NRMs in selected newspapers and magazines in the UK 
              between 1975 and 1985 and partly on a thorough but more impressionistic 
              study of the portrayal of NRMs in British, American and French newspapers 
              and magazines since 1985. 
            <p>The regular Newsletter of FAIR, the main ACM in Britain, devotes 
              a great deal of space to print and broadcast reports of problematic 
              NRMS. There is no evidence that these reports are checked for accuracy 
              or bias. It is enough that they have appeared in print.
