            <p align=LEFT><i>This statement of the understanding of the Guru in 
              ISKCON was specifically written for inclusion as evidence in a recent 
              legal challenge brought by ISKCON against alleged misrepresentation 
              by the German Federal Government. The word Guru has found it's way 
              into the international vocabulary over the last thirty years but 
              few can claim to understand the words actual meaning, especially 
              in its relationship to the language and culture from which it comes. 
              This statement is concise, philosophically sound and relevant to 
              ISKCON's unique culture of global Vaishnavism. As such it is an 
              important contribution to our attempts to communicate a genuine 
              understanding of Vaishnava culture in today's world. </i> 
            <p>Those who have not actually studied ISKCON can easily misrepresent 
              the position of the guru as actually understood and practiced in 
              ISKCON. They usually derive their prejudice from vague, over-general 
              conceptions of 'Hinduism,' or from what they see in some Hindu-derived 
              guru-sects which are in fact quite contrary to ISKCON in philosophy 
              and practice. 
            <p>There are many diverse traditions in what is called 'Hinduism.' 
              ISKCON is the contemporary extension of a particular, very ancient 
              Vaishnava tradition or denomination called the Gaudiya Madhva sampradaya. 
              The Vaishnava traditions are the monotheistic denominations within 
              'Hinduism.' They all teach that every living being is eternally 
              the subordinate servant of the Supreme Being, God. Those who have 
              not taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with ISKCON, or even 
              with the teachings and practices common to all Vaishnavas, crudely 
              misrepresent the position of guru in ISKCON as an absolute autocrat, 
              accountable to no one, able to act on any whim, to whom the disciple 
              owes unthinking, uncritical, fanatical obedience. These ignorant 
              critics claim that the guru is thought to be identical with God 
              Himself-a blasphemous equation according to Vaishnava teaching. 
            <p>The guru is the representative of God as well as of the entire 
              historical teaching tradition. He is not God but the servant of 
              God, and indeed the servant of the servants of the servants of God. 
              The Word of God is Scripture, and that Scripture has been elucidated 
              and applied throughout the historical guru-succession coming from 
              God. The devotee who has become a guru or teacher in succession 
              does so by virtue of being the disciple of the previous teacher, 
              who has in turn become guru by the same process. Thus the guru is 
              held accountable for his actions to Scripture and to the teaching 
              tradition, that is, to the previous authorities of the community. 
              The guru in the Vaishnava tradition is not absolute in himself, 
              then, but rather supremely relative: relative to the Lord and to 
              the tradition. 
            <p>As a teacher, the guru is supposed to instruct his students in 
              the Scripture and in the teaching of the previous exemplary devotees. 
              He makes these texts and instructions available to his students. 
              The students are to use their own critical judgement, their intelligence, 
              to see that their own teacher is in strict conformity with Scripture 
              and tradition. Only by virtue of that conformity, that relativity 
              and dependence, can the guru be said to truly represent (re-present) 
              God and the tradition. 
            <p>For this reason, Srila Prabhupada made it the prime work of his 
              mission to deliver to us a vast library of philosophical and practical 
              writings. These books are the central Scriptures of the tradition, 
              elucidated by the reflections and realisations of the previous teachers 
              in the tradition. Whatever he taught was backed up by the word of 
              God and the great authorities of the past. Thus, Srila Prabhupada 
              gave the standard by which we were to judge him, and accept him 
              or reject him by the exercise of critical intelligence. That meant 
              gaining real philosophical understanding of the tradition, and applying 
              it with discrimination. 
            <p>'Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism,' 
              Srila Prabhupada wrote in his commentary to <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> 
              3.4. He amplified this in a lecture of l966: 'You should be religious, 
              but should understand everything philosophically. Otherwise one 
              becomes fanatic, religious fanatic. In the <i>Caitanya-caritamrta</i> 
              it is clearly said that <i>caitanyer dayera katha karaha vicara</i>. 
              You people, you try to understand the gifts of Caitanya Mahaprabhu 
              by your philosophical understanding. Not blindly, philosophically.' 
              This instruction is applied in the matter of the guru: As stated 
              in the <i> Science of Self-Realization</i> (Chapter 2): 'The <i>sastras</i> 
              [scriptures] enjoin that before we take a guru we study him carefully 
              . . . . We should not accept a guru suddenly, out of fanaticism. 
              That is very dangerous.' 
            <p>Indeed, the regulations of ISKCON also explicitly set forth the 
              specific circumstances under which a disciple ought to reject his 
              guru. These regulations are based upon the direction of previous 

              authorities. The existence of such provisions (for a disciple's 
              rejection of his guru) attests to the recognition of the need for 
              continuing cultivation of critical intelligence on the part of the 
              disciple. 
            <p>The regulations of ISKCON are established by its governing board. 
              ISKCON also differs from many 'guru-sects' in that it is headed 
              not by a single individual, but by a board of directors, the Governing 
              Body Commission. At present this board consist of about thirty members, 
              some of whom are gurus and some not. Within ISKCON, about sixty 
              devotees currently act as initiating gurus. Each one of them operates 
              under the GBC's authority and scrutiny, and are fully accountable 
              to it. 
            <p>Thus the guru in ISKCON is not an absolute autocrat who can act 
              according to his whims and whom his disciples must blindly accept 
              and follow. The guru is held up to a rigorous standard and is accountable 
              for all he does: to God, to Scripture, to the tradition, to the 
              governing body of ISKCON, and to his own disciples.
