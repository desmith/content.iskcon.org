            <p align=left class="maintextsubhead">Publisher: Bhaktivedanta Institute, 
              San Diego<br>
              Authors: Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson<br>
              ISBN: 0-9635309-8-4 
            <p align=LEFT>When a scientific theory gathers the status of a dogma, 
              the possibilities of new research being conducted in that area and 
              the room for new theories on the matter become severely restricted. 
            <p
 align=LEFT>Those who try to break through such barriers run the risk of castigation 
              and prejudice. They find few champions in academia. The going is 
              all uphill. Mentally they are pushing against the habits and collective 
              unconscious of many powerful minds and help even of the simplest 
              kind from the 'establishment' is rarely forthcoming. 
            <p align=LEFT>Their task is not an easy one and many do not have the 
              character, the time, the funds or the other necessary resources 
              to do justice to their thesis. It then becomes easy for others to 
              criticise their work, dismissing it from the view-point of 'established 
              opinion' as the work of a misguided enthusiast without giving it 
              the real consideration it deserves. 
            <p align=LEFT>Michael Cremo and Richard Thompson are therefore to 
              be congratulated on spending eight years producing the only definitive, 
              precise, exhaustive and complete record of practically all the fossil 
              finds of man, regardless of whether they fit the established scientific 
              theories or not. To say that research is painstaking is a wild under-statement. 
              No other book of this magnitude and caliber exists. It should be 
              compulsory reading for every first year biology, archaeology and 
              anthropology student-and many others too! 
            <p align=LEFT>The nine-hundred and fourteen excellently produced pages 
              of Forbidden Archeology take us through so many anomalies of fossil 
              man-anomalies only according to modern theories-that unless every 
              single one of these finds is incorrectly dated, documented and observed, 
              man's present scientific theories of his own origins must now be 
              radically re-assessed. If only one human fossil or human artifact 
              of the fifty or so meticulously documented and discussed from the 
              Miocene or early Pliocene is correctly dated then everything concerning 
              the theories of human origins must return to the melting pot. And 
              the evidence is that a large portion of them are entirely credible. 
            <p align=LEFT>Why then have they not been previously considered? Because 
              the roller-coaster of habituated mind patterns and dogma has simply 
              brushed them aside as do creationists who - faced with all the evidence 
              of ancient times- still insist that the world was created in 4004 
              BC, according to a preconceived opinion. The psychological processes 
              are in both instances the same. 
            <p align=LEFT>We are treated to Pliocene bones, including a skull 
              from middle Pliocene strata near Castendolo in Italy, maybe five 
              million years old. Bones found in carboniferous coal in Pennsylvania, 
              at least 286 million years old and capped by two feet of slate rock, 
              90 feet below the surface. Footprints of Human-like, bipedal creatures 
              who lived in carboniferous Kentucky and Pennsylvania and Missouri 
              too. Flint tools from the Miocene, 10 to 12 million years old, found 
              in Burma and the same from even older Late Oligocene sands in Belgium. 
              Hundreds of metallic spheres with three parallel grooves running 
              around their equator, found in recent decades by South African miners 
              in Precambrian mineral deposits 2.8 billion years old. And a great 
              deal more. 
            <p align=LEFT>The book is both entertaining and scholarly-a rare combination. 
              It rolls along presenting its information in a logical and coherent 
              fashion, making honest comment and assessment as it goes. There 
              is nothing long-winded about it-only thoroughness. Data is not pressed 
              into the service of any particular doctrine but presented and left 
              to tell its own story. Words like 'possible' and 'not sure' are 
              used quite commonly, a practice that demonstrates an intellectual 
              honesty and integrity that would, with profit benefit many proponents 
              of the more conventional points of view. 
            <p align=LEFT>Cremo and Thompson also describe the process by which 
              data gets suppressed - consciously and unconsciously - and discuss 
              all the evidence upon which modern theories are founded. 
            <p align=LEFT><i>Forbidden Archeology</i> deserves to provoke discussion 
              and controversy. It should not be swept aside or ignored. If the 
              general scientific community once again put their heads in the sand 
              until the furor passes by, they will be guilty of negligence in 
              their duty to the world at large as self-professed seekers of the 
              truth of things.
