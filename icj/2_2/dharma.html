            <p align=LEFT><i>In this article Krishna Dharma dasa stokes up the 
              coals of that old 'varnasrama debate'. But rather than outline how 
              the proposed varnasrama system will change the face of present society; 
              or rather than plead with us all to get back to the land, he questions 
              how our proposals will ever be taken seriously if we do not integrate 
              the principles of varnasrama into the present ISKCON structure. 
              For instance, without a definition of the roles of the varnas, beginning 
              with those roles relating to our own society, it will be hard to 
              avoid speculation and confusion on this issue and thus impossible 
              for us to 'sing from the same song sheet' to those outside of ISKCON. 
              Can we call a temple president a brahmin or a ksatriya, or both? 
              (Hands up all those who want to be called sudras!). Krishna Dharma 
              proposes an ISKCON constitution based on the principles of varnasrama 
              which could serve as the first neo-vedic working model. </i>  
            <p>In an earlier essay in this journal I examined the concept of 'Spiritual 
              Solutions to Material Problems'<a href="dharmafoot.html#1"> 1</a>. 
              One particularly awkward material problem of today's times is that 
              of societal organisation. We are witnessing severe difficulties 
              in almost all societies, whether they be capitalist, socialist, 
              communist, autocracies, democracies, theocracies or whatever. I 
              don't think I need substantiate that statement with evidences; a 
              glance at any serious daily newspaper should suffice. The virtual 
              collapse of communism-the increasing unemployment, poverty and crime 
              in Western consumer society-the oppression of the theocracies and 
              autocracies-nothing seems to be working very well. Library shelves 
              are filled with books offering numerous ideas, theories and examples 
              of different kinds of social structures and systems. But I think 
              it is fair to say that we have yet to see in practise anything even 
              coming anywhere near to perfection. 
            <p>So what 'spiritual solutions' has ISKCON got to offer? Can we show 
              anything better? ISKCON is itself an organised institutional society, 
              so what about its own organisation? Is it in any way distinct and 
              different from what we see in greater society? Is it something we 
              can demonstrate to the world as being ideal? Do we even want to 
              have such organisation within ISKCON? Is it appropriate-or should 
              we simply be an integral group of preachers and missionaries with 
              as simple an organisational structure as possible? Sometimes we 
              even encounter the argument that ISKCON is an organisation held 
              together by a philosophical accord and 'love and trust'. That anyone 
              who follows the instructions given by Srila Prabhupada is a 'member 
              of ISKCON' and we do not require any bureaucratic and official structures 
              to confirm that. In any case, how can we get involved with societal 
              organisation on a broader scale, offering solutions to the problems 
              mentioned above? These and other associated questions will be examined 
              in this essay. 
            <p><b>ISKCON's Organisation<br>
              </b>I would like first to examine ISKCON's own internal organisation. 
              What is the present framework and is it what it should be? We find 
              some specific direction about how to manage ISKCON given by Srila 
              Prabhupada, although not so much in our main canon or literature's. 
              It was in his discussions with ISKCON leaders and in his letters 
              and finally in his will, that Srila Prabhupada spoke more directly 
              about ISKCON management. Obviously the first consideration in organising 
              society is its leadership and this was dealt with by Srila Prabhupada 
              in his formation of the Governing Body Commission (GBC). This he 
              established in pursuance of the order of his own spiritual master, 
              Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, who had asked for such an entity 
              to be formed within his own earlier organisation, the Gaudiya Math. 
              I shall not trace the history of the Gaudiya Math here, but suffice 
              it to say that they failed to form a GBC body and thereby the mission 
              did not succeed in the way desired by Bhaktisiddhanta. At least, 
              that is, as far as preaching was concerned. We find this stated 
              by Srila Prabhupada as follows: 
            <ul>
              <p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, at the time of his departure, 
                requested all his disciples to form a governing body and conduct 
                missionary activities co-operatively. He did not instruct a particular 
                man to become the next acarya. But just after his passing away, 
                his leading secretaries made plans, without authority, to occupy 
                the post of <i>acarya,</i> and they split in two factions over 
                who the next <i>acarya</i> would be. Consequently, both factions 
                were <i>asara,</i> or useless, because they had no authority, 
                having disobeyed the order of the spiritual master. Despite the 
                spiritual master's order to form a governing body and execute 
                the missionary activities of the Gaudiya Matha, the two un-authorised 
                factions began litigation that is still going on after forty years 
                with no decision.<a href="dharmafoot.html#2">2</a> 
            </ul>
            <p> Therefore, a GBC body was formed early in ISKCON's development. 
              Even during his presence, Srila Prabhupada wanted to transfer the 
              responsibility for managing ISKCON to the GBC. The precise function 
              of this body was defined to some degree by Srila Prabhupada and 
              since his departure the GBC itself has further refined that definition. 
              Perhaps the nearest thing to a full definition was made in 1987 
              by a large group of Srila Prabhupada's disciples. At that time, 
              perceiving that there may be a lack of confidence in its leadership, 
              the GBC body empowered a 50 man committee, comprised of senior ISKCON 
              devotees, to review, revise and even reform the GBC. 
            <p>This committee published a short paper which detailed the requisite 
              qualities and role of the GBC and its representatives. The paper 
              was fully based upon extensive research into the instructions of 
              Srila Prabhupada. In respect of the subject matter of this essay, 
              the most significant item mentioned for the GBC body as a whole 
              was the first one: 'To be the ultimate managing authority (in ISKCON)'<a href="dharmafoot.html#3">3</a> 
              This statement is actually found in the last will and testament 
              of Srila Prabhupada. There followed a list of many other functions 
              for the GBC, both collective and individual. One of those statements, 
              which I would like to focus upon, and which I feel could ultimately 
              contain all other definitions of functions and roles, is 'To formulate 
              a constitution based upon Prabhupada's indications and to be held 
              accountable to it'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#4"> 4</a> 
            <p>This I feel is a critical point. A constitution should be, as far 
              as may be possible, a full definition of structure, organisation 
              and managerial procedures within ISKCON. In fact there are already 
              many various definitions of these latter things to be found throughout 
              the resolutions of the GBC body. But these have yet to be correlated 
              and compiled into a single working document, or constitution. It 
              is therefore seen that ISKCON as a whole presently lacks a certain 
              coherence and uniformity, at least structurally and managerial. 
              Being aware of this fact, the GBC body have delegated a group of 
              devotees to work on the formation of a constitution. 
            <p><b>The Ultimate Authority<br>
              </b>Where then should it begin? We know at least that the GBC body 
              is the 'ultimate managerial authority'. But that alone is not a 
              definition of a complete and complex society. We find a few other 
              directions in the instructions of Srila Prabhupada regarding management 
              of ISKCON. 'The management of our different centres is made by three 
              officers, namely a president, secretary and a treasurer.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#5">5</a> 
              'So far the practical management is concerned, that is required, 
              but not that we should become too much absorbed in fancy organisation....so 
              whatever organisation needs to be done, the Presidents may handle 
              and take advice and assistance from their GBC representative.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#6">6</a> 
              So a quite simple structure was defined and that has pretty much 
              endured to the present day. 
            <p>Srila Prabhupada also gave some directions as to how the GBC should 
              function. 'To map out global preaching strategy for the world wide 
              society, while leaving details of local preaching to the local management.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#7">7</a> 
              'To chalk out yearly plans and then execute without change'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#8">8</a> 
              'To ensure that current policies and regulations of the GBC Body 
              are upheld in his zone'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#9">9</a> 'To 
              supervise and advise, not dictate, in all the above'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#10">10</a> 
              The basic instruction is that the GBC should have the ultimate power 
              in ISKCON, but should not wield that in a hands-on fashion to manage 
              the society. Day to day management should be localised. Policies 
              and standards, both managerially and spiritually, are set by the 
              GBC, but their implementation is effected by local managers. The 
              GBC simply acts as an overseer, although the power of veto must 
              be held by them. 
            <p>This raises an interesting point. For effective organisation within 
              any structure, power should always be accompanied by accountability. 
              Rights or privileges should always be commensurate with responsibility. 
              Have you ever been in the awkward position of being responsible 
              for a task, but without being handed, from your boss, sufficient 
              authority to perform that task? Or perhaps as a leader you may have 
              some experience of being the person where the 'buck stops', but 
              you don't have any control. And, of course, we have all seen the 
              havoc that can ensue when a leader runs amok, acting as a law unto 
              himself. It should be obvious that to effect the kind of organisation 
              we require in ISKCON, giving all ultimate power to the GBC, while 
              freeing them of the responsibility for day to day management, and 
              at the same time building in certain checks and balances, will require 
              a carefully thought out and well defined structure. Especially as 
              the society grows in size and complexity. 
            <p>It is also of interest to note that the GBC body has the responsibility 
              to 'appoint, suspend and expel GBC members'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#11">11</a> 
              In other words, the GBC itself is an oligarchic entity. It is not 
              open to voting or election for membership, outside of its own members. 
              This was how Srila Prabhupada defined them. They really are the 
              final authority in ISKCON. The only way there can be accountability 
              for oligarchic bodies is to have a constitution to which they are 
              accountable. Of course, even that is no guarantee against serious 
              abuses of power in such a structure. Short of revolutions, nothing 
              can stop tyrannical and despotic leadership. But we would certainly 
              not expect such things to occur within a spiritual society, where 
              the top leadership is, after all, always likely to be the most spiritually 
              mature individuals. A constitution would surely provide adequate 
              controls and restraints. 
            <p>Another point to consider in formulating our structure is the growing 
              demand for democratic representation. As ISKCON increases in size 
              and scope there are more and more distinct groups, beyond just the 
              core full time membership, involved in its operation. Different 
              levels of committed supporters form ISKCON's growing congregation 
              and they, in return for their support, need a voice in deciding 
              how ISKCON is run. Although the classic Vedic conception of society 
              is one of autocracy -the all powerful monarch-Srila Prabhupada did 
              at times indicate that democracy has a place in ISKCON. For example, 
              in 1974 he instructed the devotees not to change the temple president 
              at Bhaktivedanta Manor without a vote amongst all the devotees. 
              In fact he even went so far as to say that even the GBC could not 
              change the president without a local vote.<a href="dharmafoot.html#12">12</a>
            <p><b>What Do Prabhupada's Book's Say?<br>
              </b>So what kind of structure can we devise for ISKCON which will 
              take into consideration all the above points? Perhaps for guidance 
              we should now turn to the ISKCON canon, our body of literature, 
              rather than letters and conversations with Srila Prabhupada. After 
              all, it can be said that instructions in the latter were always 
              subject to considerations of time, place and circumstance. For example, 
              the statement I quoted above that 'whatever organisation needs to 
              be done the Temple Presidents can handle', was made in 1972. In 
              that same letter it was also said that 'The formula for ISKCON organisation 
              is very simple...The world is divided into twelve zones. For each 
              zone there is one zonal secretary appointed by Srila Prabhupada.' 
              Obviously we have moved on since then and these instructions are 
              no longer appropriate. ISKCON is already larger and more complex, 
              having many more than just twelve GBC zonal secretaries. Thus we 
              need to consider such instructions carefully in terms of their current 
              relevance. On the other hand, the instructions written in our scriptures 
              are more enduring. 
            <p>Our understanding is that the Vedas and Vedic knowledge are eternal. 
              Srila Prabhupada's instructions in his purports to the Vedas are 
              therefore applicable in all places and at all times. How to apply 
              the instructions according to time and place needs to be considered, 
              but the unchanging principles are given in the Vedic scriptures. 
              So what instructions about the principles of societal organisation 
              can we find in scripture? 
            <p>In the Vedas, any discussion on how to organise and manage society 
              generally centres on the <i>varnashrama</i> system; the four social 
              and four spiritual orders. Before I look at that, I want to first 
              address a very common misconception about the system of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i>. From my experience in speaking on Hinduism in schools 
              and colleges, I have found that whenever I discuss Vedic society 
              I always need to begin by addressing the doubt that <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> means something like the present caste system seen in 
              India. In fact it does not. The caste system is a serious corruption 
              of <i>varnashrama dharma</i> as it is described in the <i>Vedas.</i> 
              Everyone knows about the Hindu caste system and its awful abuses 
              of human rights. Although <i>varnashrama</i> may sound very similar, 
              there is in fact a great difference. 
            <p>There are many points of variance, but perhaps the most critical 
              variation between casteism and <i>varnashrama</i> is that in the 
              latter one's designation is based upon personal qualities, whereas 
              in the former it depends solely upon birth. In Vedic <i> varnashrama 
              dharma</i>, if you were born in a working class, or <i>sudra,</i> 
              family, but had the quality of a scholar, or <i>brahmana,</i> then 
              you would be considered a <i>brahmana</i> despite your birth. Or 
              vice versa. This should be an obvious point, after all, will the 
              son of a high court judge necessarily be himself a judge? Or the 
              son of a doctor also become one? That much social mobility is there 
              in <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, although in today's caste system that 
              is, of course, not at all the case, and hence all the problems. 
              So, in speaking about <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, I am speaking about 
              something which is hardly seen today, even in India. 
            <p>In the Vedas there are some quite strong statements about the necessity 
              for <i>varnashrama dharma</i>. Consider, for example, the following: 
            <ul>
              <p>'To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually 
                progress toward the goal of life- namely spiritual understanding-the 
                principles of <i>varnasrama-dharma</i> must be accepted...It is 
                said that unless human society is regulated by <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>, 
                it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#13">13</a><br>
                <br>
                'Materialistic activities are regulated by the institution of 
                <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>. Without <i>varnasrama-dharma</i>, materialistic 
                activities constitute animal life.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#14">14</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>Similar such statements are numerous throughout the instructions 
              of Srila Prabhupada. <i>Varnashrama dharma</i> , is the only social 
              system described in the <i>Vedas</i> although, having said that, 
              it should be noted that <i>varnashrama</i> is a very broad style 
              of organisation that incorporates many of the societal systems we 
              see today. More about that later. However, according to Vedic direction, 
              if any society is to be worthy of the being called 'organised' and 
              indeed 'civilised', it must be arranged according to the divisions 
              of <i>varnashrama dharma</i>. It is said to be a scientific system, 
              perfectly arranged and balanced, which has the particular feature 
              of leading society towards the goal of life, God realisation. 
            <p>Within ISKCON society at present a semblance of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> is emerging. We already have the four <i>ashramas</i>,<i> 
              brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha </i>and<i> sannyasa</i>. We do 
              not as yet have any clear definitions of the four <i>varnas.</i> 
              In fact, there is still some uncertainty as to whether or not such 
              definitions are even appropriate. There is a doubt that <i>vaisnavas</i> 
              should not be designated as belonging to any particular caste. Indeed, 
              there are various statements in the Vedas that <i>vaisnavas</i> 
              are transcendental to <i>varnashrama dharma</i>. I will briefly 
              discuss the spiritual technicalities of this argument shortly. For 
              now I would like to continue the discussion of the organisational 
              structure of society. 
            <p> Whatever our views on the spiritual relevance of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> to <i>vaisnavas</i> and ISKCON, we must consider the 
              fact that it is the only system of societal organisation recommended 
              by the <i>Vedas.</i> From the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> we learn that 
              it is a system created by Krishna Himself and is therefore eternal.<a href="dharmafoot.html#15">15</a> 
              Thus its application is always relevant in any society. We could 
              go so far as to say that any other system of organisation is temporary 
              and will therefore fail, sooner or later. And, as we began by pointing 
              out, looking at any society today we could well say q.e.d. to that. 
            <p><b>Roles, Rights and Responsibilities<br>
              </b>So what, you might ask, has this got to do with my first discussion 
              of ISKCON's constitution? Well, varnashrama dharma provides a structure 
              for society which clearly defines the rights and responsibilities 
              of every individual. It describes how interaction between all classes 
              of persons should take place. These are the very definitions and 
              descriptions that are required in a constitution. We are presently 
              trying to define our structure using terms such as 'GBC', 'Temple 
              President', 'Secretary', 'Treasurer', 'Officer', 'Cook' etc. etc. 
              But when we look through our ISKCON literature we do not find these 
              terms mentioned. 
            <p> However, there is much discussion about the roles and duties of 
              individuals within <i>varnashrama dharma</i>. We can't discover 
              from the Vedas how a temple president should act, but we can learn, 
              for instance, that the duty of a <i>brahmana</i> is to be learned 
              in scripture, to teach, to be simple, to guide the administrative 
              leaders and so on. In return for that the <i>brahmana</i> is entitled 
              to accept charity, or even to be maintained by the state. The duty 
              of the <i>ksatriya,</i> the administrative head, is to protect the 
              citizens and manage the affairs of state, and he is allowed to collect 
              taxes from the people. The relationship between these two orders 
              is also clearly defined, as well as those between them and all the 
              other orders. In this way a definite framework for the organisation 
              of society is described. 
            <p>Indeed, within a properly functioning <i>varnashrama</i> society 
              there is complete interdependence. The rights of one order are the 
              responsibilities of another. The <i>brahmanas</i> are protected 
              and supported by the <i>ksatriyas,</i> who in turn are guided and 
              counselled by the <i>brahmanas.</i> The <i>vaisyas</i> are given, 
              by the <i>ksatriya</i> leaders, the facilities for food production 
              and in return they pay taxes. All the orders require the labour 
              of the <i>sudra</i> or working class. In fact <i>varnashrama dharma</i> 
              is analogised in the example of the social body. The <i>brahmana</i> 
              is the head, the <i>ksatriya</i> is the arms, the <i>vaisya</i> 
              is the belly and the <i>sudra</i> is the legs. All the parts are 
              needed for the body to be healthy. Similarly, there are duties incumbent 
              upon the various <i>ashramas.</i> The <i>grhasthas,</i> for example, 
              are expected to earn wealth and support all the other <i>ashramas.</i> 
              The <i>brahmacaris</i> should receive spiritual education and training. 
              The <i> sannyasis</i> should act as the spiritual masters of all 
              the other orders. In this way we can go through all the <i>ashramas</i> 
              and again find interdependence. 
            <p>Perhaps at this point I could address the question of democracy. 
              It is another doubt regarding <i>varnashrama,</i> that it disallows 
              democracy, and this point is quite relevant to the points made in 
              the above paragraph. As I stated previously, it seems Srila Prabhupada 
              was not averse to democracy, although the usual model of Vedic society 
              is one of autocratic monarchy. Let's first ask the question: What 
              is democracy? Essentially it is an attempt to give a voice and some 
              power to the people in general. Everyone in any society should have 
              certain rights and some recourse if those rights are abused. If 
              we examine carefully <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, especially in regards 
              to the points made in the paragraph above, we do see that the rights 
              of the individual are a key feature in role definitions. The leaders 
              themselves are expected to protect the people, even to the point 
              of going personally out to tackle subversive elements in society, 
              such as robbers. Or being at the head of the army which confronts 
              hostile forces attacking the kingdom. There are innumerable examples 
              of such leadership in the <i>Vedas.</i> If one does not fulfil the 
              requirements of the role, then one cannot expect to remain situated 
              in that role and enjoy the privileges thereof. In the case of the 
              leader the check and balance comes from the <i>brahmanas.</i> Woe 
              betide the monarch who, becoming carried away with his position 
              and power, neglects their counsel. (See, for example, the story 
              of King Vena in the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>, Canto 4, chapter 14). 
            <p>The qualified <i>brahmana</i> counsellors, being entirely without 
              any vested personal interests in the state, are always the well 
              wishers of the whole populace. And if any <i>brahmanas</i> are not 
              qualified then either other <i>brahmanas</i> will check that, or 
              even the monarch himself, who has the responsibility of ensuring 
              that everyone in society is properly performing their own duties. 
              We see then that, due to the careful balance of individual rights 
              within <i>varnashrama</i> society, the need for voting systems is 
              largely obviated. It still does have some application, however, 
              and I will return to that shortly. 
            <p><b>Applying Varnasrama to ISKCON<br>
              </b>At this point, without getting too deeply into a discussion 
              of <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, I would like to tie it in a little 
              more with the discussion about ISKCON's constitution. I feel that 
              we need to look at the various roles within our society and relate 
              them to their corresponding <i>varnashrama</i> position. For example, 
              the GBC. What kind of role is this? The top, visionary, policy-making, 
              leadership role seems to be very much in accord with that of the 
              <i>brahmana.</i> Especially when we also take into account the fact 
              that we do not want them to be hands-on managers. If we therefore 
              say that the GBC are a brahminical body, then we need to consider 
              what other responsibilities are incumbent upon them. What are the 
              full duties of the <i>brahmanas</i>? Are they performing all those? 
              And further, what are the privileges of the <i>brahmanas</i> in 
              society. Do they have all those? Again, what is a temple president? 
              Is he also a <i>brahmana,</i> or perhaps a <i>ksatriya</i>? In this 
              way we can begin to examine various existing roles in ISKCON and 
              see how they line up with the <i>varnashrama</i> system. 
            <p align=LEFT>This is more than just an interesting exercise. As I 
              have said, from the statements of the <i>Vedas</i> we know that 
              <i>varnashrama dharma</i> is the only system of societal organisation 
              recommended for human society. Unless we are able to define our 
              own organisation in its-varnashrama-terms, we may well be speculating 
              a different system with built in fatal flaws. For example, there 
              is mention in the <i>Vedas</i> of <i>paradharma</i>. This means 
              when a member of a particular order in society performs the duties 
              of another order. In <i>varnashramadharma</i> this is generally 
              considered anathema. The balance of social order is maintained by 
              every one performing their own duties. As I already mentioned, in 
              <i>varnashrama dharma</i> there is complete interdependence. The 
              Vedic statements are quite strong on this point: 'To follow another's 
              path is dangerous.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#16"> 16</a> 'It is 
              better to engage imperfectly in one's own occupation than perfectly 
              in another's.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#17">17</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Again, I don't wish to presently enter into a deep discussion 
              of <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, but the point is that one should know 
              what is one's own duty and properly perform that rather than do 
              anything else. If someone is working half as a <i>brahmana</i> and 
              half as a <i>ksatriya</i> then there will be problems. Or if one 
              is enjoying the status and privileges of a <i>brahmana,</i> then 
              it will be quite anomalous if he accepts only the responsibilities 
              incumbent upon a <i>sudra</i> or <i>vaisya.</i> If therefore, we 
              have a post such as temple president and that is defined as a brahminical 
              post, then it should be fully performed as such. The person performing 
              that duty should be careful not to embrace the duties of another 
              order. He should also ensure that he is properly observing the responsibilities 
              incumbent upon a <i>brahmana.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>For example, one could not be a <i>brahmana</i> within 
              the <i>varnashrama</i> system and be in the employ of someone else. 
              Or be desirous of an opulent lifestyle. Or neglect the duty of studying 
              and teaching scripture. These things may be appropriate or acceptable 
              in other orders, but not for <i>brahmanas.</i> Or if we have a post 
              which is identified as being a <i>ksatriya</i> type of engagement, 
              then again other responsibilities are there. For example, unlike 
              the <i>brahmanas,ksatriyas</i> cannot accept charity. But they can 
              live a more opulent lifestyle. They can exact taxes, but they must 
              be chivalrous and powerful. And so on. <i>Paradharma</i> is only 
              one anomaly that may be present, there are numerous others, the 
              presence of which will all cause the ultimate failure of societal 
              order. The only way to root out these anomalies is to properly define, 
              and then work within, a <i>varnashrama</i> structure based on scriptural 
              direction. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Can There be Democracy?<br>
              </b>Interestingly, we find many kinds of the societal systems seen 
              today present within the whole <i>varnashrama</i> picture. For example, 
              as I mentioned above, a certain amount of democracy is there. But 
              it only has application amongst equals. There is a story in the 
              <i>Vedas</i> of how, one day, the lions, traditionally the powerful 
              leaders of the animal community, decide to become more democratic. 
              The jackals approached them and asked if they could be involved 
              in selecting the leader. The lions liberally agreed saying; 'We 
              lions have always been running things amongst ourselves. Let's give 
              these jackals a fair say in things. We shall all have a vote and 
              thus decide who shall lead.' In this way, when the vote was called, 
              the jackals, who far outnumbered the lions, selected the best jackal 
              to be the leader of all the animals. And thus, having for its leader 
              an unqualified and weak animal, there was chaos amongst the animal 
              community. So democracy must be carefully applied in its proper 
              context. 
            <p align=LEFT>As <i>varnashrama dharma</i> is a system designed by 
              and directed towards God, this raises one other point with regard 
              to the flaws inherent in democracy. We see today that, because we 
              have a complete democracy in society, the qualities of leadership 
              are dictated by current public whims. The leaders try to determine 
              what the people want and then simply offer that. But in <i>varnashrama</i> 
              the leader is representing God and not the people. He represents 
              God and protects the people (and the animals). Just as the father 
              knows what may be in the best interests of the child, even though 
              the child may desire something else, so God knows what is best for 
              society. The parents will never allow the child to eat only sweets, 
              or stop going to school, although this may be the child's wish, 
              because they know what will be in the child's own best interests-what 
              will make him happy. Similarly, the leader should lead according 
              to the directions of the supreme father, God, and thus really benefit 
              the people. 
            <p align=LEFT>To provide liquor houses, gambling shops, pornography 
              and so on, may be popular, but it does nothing conducive to the 
              stability and happiness of society. We can see how the current type 
              of democracy fails by witnessing how we are always changing the 
              leaders. Although they are offering more and more economic and material 
              gains, basically what most people believe will make them happy, 
              because the directions of God are neglected, no one is happy and 
              society is a mess. In <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, the leadership 
              directs society towards the spiritual goal of life, which is an 
              unchanging direction given by God, and which gives everyone complete 
              happiness. 
            <p align=LEFT>Another feature of today's society also found in <i>varnashrama</i> 
              is capitalism. This is found amongst the <i>vaisyas.</i> But again, 
              it cannot be taken out of its specific context and broadly applied 
              to the whole of society. The <i>brahmanas,</i> for example, cannot 
              be concerned with material acquisition and gain. They must remain 
              materially aloof in order to retain their position of independence 
              and spiritual power. Just see today the endless scandals involving 
              corruption amongst the leaders, who so often have personal vested 
              interests over and above those of the people they are supposed to 
              be protecting. Again in <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, there is theocracy 
              and autocracy, but, as already discussed, these are mutually self 
              balancing. 
            <p align=LEFT>As I stated, the whole <i>varnashrama</i> society is 
              designed by God and is meant for His ultimate pleasure and satisfaction; 
              which of course means the satisfaction of everyone, as everyone 
              is a part of the supreme whole or God. In this sense there is even, 
              within the whole of society, communism, as every individual works, 
              with God at the centre, for the good of the whole. Everyone is a 
              part of the whole and thus everyone benefits. Srila Prabhupada would 
              often compare Vedic society with communism, saying that the only 
              difference is that we have Krishna at the centre rather than the 
              state. The moral instructions of the <i>Vedas</i> regarding societal 
              organisation also require that everyone is always considerate of 
              the welfare of others; the famous <i>ahimsa,</i> propounded by Mahatma 
              Gandhi. 
            <p align=LEFT>Understanding <i>varnashrama dharma</i> and its application 
              is, I feel, the only way we can create an effective structure for 
              ISKCON. One that will work and one that will endure. Although we 
              need not abandon the use of terms such as GBC, Temple President 
              etc., we need to understand them in terms of the <i> varnashrama</i> 
              model. Then we will understand how our relationships should work. 
              At least this could be the basis. By defining the various <i>varnashrama</i> 
              roles we will have the basic framework onto which we could place 
              all our other terms and definitions. Such a framework really would 
              be a 'house in which the whole world can live.' Within that basic 
              framework we could have other institutions. 
            <p align=LEFT>For example, within <i>varnashrama</i> society we find 
              separate and distinct communities for all the various orders of 
              life, each having their own leadership and organisation. But their 
              individual duties and inter-relationships are defined, integrating 
              them all into a complete society. Perhaps, within <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i>, ISKCON will evolve as an organisation of <i>brahmanas,</i> 
              or perhaps it may become the larger framework into which everything 
              else fits. That is a difficult question to resolve at present, although 
              I don't think it really matters. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Spiritual Questions and Solutions<br>
              </b>Perhaps here I should, as promised, briefly examine some of 
              the spiritual questions which my essay may have posed. Should <i>vaisnavas</i> 
              accept designations within <i>varnashrama dharma</i>? Can they, 
              being 'transcendental' to <i>varnashrama dharma</i>, just do anything 
              at any time, according to the needs? To some this may sound foolish, 
              but I do feel that this fundamental doubt exists and needs to be 
              cleared up. First of all, I personally cannot see any problem with 
              accepting the various <i>varnashrama</i> epithets. We are already 
              accepting designations within ISKCON: 'GBC', 'Temple President', 
              'Training Officer', 'Cook', and so on. That does not mean that we 
              are not <i>vaisnavas.</i> The designation is accepted purely to 
              denote one's duty and to facilitate organisation. That is also the 
              case with <i>varnashrama</i> designations. Besides which, we already 
              do accept the <i>ashrama</i> designations, so why not <i>varna</i> 
              as well? 
            <ul>
              <p>'Although the Krsna consciousness movement is a movement of <i>brahmanas</i> 
                and <i>vaisnavas,</i> it is trying to re-establish the divine 
                <i>varnasrama</i> institution, for without this division of society 
                there cannot be peace and prosperity anywhere.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#18">18</a><br>
                'The <i>grhasthas, vanaprasthas, brahmacaris </i>and<i> sannyasis</i> 
                should endeavour together with their total energy to become Krsna 
                conscious. This type of civilisation is called <i>daiva-varnasrama.</i> 
                One of the objectives of the Krsna consciousness movement is to 
                establish this <i>daiva-varnasrama,</i> but not to encourage so-called 
                <i>varnasrama</i> without scientifically organised endeavour by 
                human society.'<a href="dharmafoot.html#19">19</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The notion that we can freely switch from one order 
              to another is rather more worrying, I feel that it needs a more 
              thorough analysis than is within the scope of this essay. I have 
              addressed this issue in a separate study which may appear in a future 
              issue of this <i>Journal.</i> I would personally argue strongly 
              that, outside of emergencies and exceptional cases, this is entirely 
              unacceptable. Obviously, if we have a society of such persons, who 
              feel they owe no allegiance to any particular set of duties and 
              can choose and change as they please, then we are going to find 
              societal organisation very difficult indeed. It is a formula for 
              chaos. 
            <p align=LEFT>To conclude then, the answer to my first question should 
              be clear. Our 'spiritual solution' to the problem of societal organisation 
              is <i>varnashrama dharma</i>. As we are now seeing a growing need 
              to properly define our own structure and organisation within ISKCON, 
              I suggest that we need to look at defining <i>varnashrama</i> roles. 
              By doing this we will not only begin to solve the difficult problem 
              of organising ourselves, but we will also start showing a practical 
              example of a spiritual solution to a real material problem. 
            <p align=LEFT>I cannot see any other way that we will be able to sort 
              out the problem of our internal organisation. Outside of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i>, what could we possibly adopt as our system? And if we 
              are not to adopt <i>varnashrama dharma</i> within ISKCON, then how 
              shall we present it to society as a whole? For whom is it meant 
              if not ourselves? This latter point is especially pertinent if we 
              consider the fact that, according to the Vedic direction, <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> only has application in a society where basic religious 
              principles-such as those followed within ISKCON-are being observed. 
              It has no scope in an irreligious society. This essay is hardly 
              conclusive; I think I am just scratching at the surface of a deep 
              and difficult subject matter. The application of <i>varnashrama 
              dharma</i> in today's climate will not be at all easy. In ISKCON 
              it is generally thought that <i> varnashrama dharma</i> means the 
              establishing of self sufficient communities, as it is difficult 
              to imagine how it could be introduced into wider society. What I 
              am suggesting is that we need to reconsider this conception; that 
              we should see <i>varnashrama dharma</i> as being the means to organise 
              ourselves throughout our entire society and, ultimately, throughout 
              the whole of human society. I would like to end with a nice passage 
              from the <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>. 
            <ul>
              <p> 'As indicated here by the words<i> sva-dharma-nirata varnasrama-gunan-vitah</i>, 
                the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution 
                of <i>varna</i> and <i>asrama,</i> which arranges society in the 
                <i>varna</i> divisions of <i>brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya </i>and<i> 
                sudra</i> and the <i>asrama</i> divisions of <i>brahmacarya, grhastha, 
                vanaprastha </i>and<i> sannyasa</i>. This is actual human civilisation. 
                People must be trained according to the different <i>varnasrama</i> 
                occupational duties. As confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (4.13), 
                <i>catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah</i>: the four 
                <i>varnas</i> must be established according to varying qualities 
                and work. The first principle for good government is that it must 
                institute this <i>varnasrama</i> system. The purpose of <i>varnasrama</i> 
                is to enable people to become God conscious. <i>Varnasramacaravata 
                purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate</i>. The entire <i>varnasrama</i> 
                scheme is intended to enable people to become <i>vaisnavas.Visnur 
                asya devata</i>. When people worship Lord Vishnu as the Supreme 
                Lord, they become <i>vaisnavas.</i> Thus people should be trained 
                to become <i>vaisnavas</i> through the system of <i>varna</i> 
                and <i>asrama,</i> as they were during the reign of Lord Ramacandra, 
                when everyone was fully trained to follow the <i>varnasrama</i> 
                principles. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the 
              citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the 
              entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and 
              parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves. Good 
              citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be 
              trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to 
              become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other 
              departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to 
              train students to become <i>brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, 
              brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas </i>and<i> sannyasis</i>. This 
              will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (<i>varnasrama-gunan-vitah</i>). 
              Generally speaking, if the king or president is a <i>rajarsi,</i> 
              the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will 
              be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the 
              state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In 
              Kali-yuga, however, because the <i>varnasrama</i> system is neglected, 
              people are generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, 
              such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves 
              and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no 
              one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found 
              in the reign of Lord Ramacandra. If people follow this example, 
              there will be good government all over the world'.<a href="dharmafoot.html#20">20</a>
