              </b>Dhyana-kunda devi dasi 
            <p>First of all, let me express my thanks for your deep, touching 
              and simultaneously thought-provoking article. Such a rare opportunity 
              it is, and a valuable one, to hear someone 'from the outside' (I 
              beg your forgiveness for this exclusive term), yet deeply religious, 
              giving a frank, philosophical and friendly account of a meeting 
              with us. Moreover, you expressed so much hope for our future growth 
              and cooperation within Krsna's all-inclusive plan. This is indeed 
              an offering of honey. I do hope you will want to associate with 
              us more and let us hear more of your reflections. 
            <p>It is so difficult sometimes for me (I believe I am not alone) 
              to imagine how other people see us. So easy is the move from the 
              position of a curious onlooker ('What a crazy folk, singing and 
              dancing in the street!') to the opposite one ('What a crazy folk, 
              running in the streets all day long, not wanting to join us in our 
              chanting and dancing!'). Yet from the outside many things can be 
              seen which would surprise us. Things we should want to know. Observations 
              that tell something not only about our approach to people and how 
              to improve it, but about our own spiritual life as well. 
            <p>Of all your interesting points, the one that went most deep into 
              my memory was the one about chanting. True, as we practice chanting 
              day after day, year after year, we may lose the freshness of experience, 
              along with the joy and gratitude for this most wonderful gift-Krsna's 
              name. How is it, actually, that we tend to look so tense, hard-working, 
              not enjoying, even though our famous slogan is 'Chant and be happy'? 
              Chanting is hard work. One is confronted with one's obstinate and 
              impetuous (friendly) enemy-the mind, loaded full with material memories, 
              desires and plans. By the external appearance I may look like a 
              devotee, but my chanting hours know how hard I have to struggle 
              to become one. Yet, moments of joy are also there. Let me relish 
              them and realize this is what the chanting is supposed to be-the 
              source of spiritual energy, an uplifting activity. It doesn't have 
              to remain hard work. 
            <p>Does chanting close the devotees off from human contact? This was 
              precisely my impression at my first encounter with the Hare Krsna 
              members, ten years ago. I felt very uneasy. But soon I understood 
              that the devotees were friendly. Chanting is meditation. <i>Kirtan</i> 
              is meant to be performed together, japa is individual. In devotional 
              practice there is time for everything, also for closing off from 
              all the external influences and trying to only cry out to Krsna 
              and hear His name. At the moment of death I will be alone with Krsna, 
              just like I am now when I chant. While chanting, I do see devotees 
              passing by and I appreciate their not stopping to talk with me, 
              not trying even to have an eye contact. This I take as an act of 
              their friendship and help. 
            <p>I am also one of the 'monks in the gathering,' and as you said, 
              I find it difficult to offer realistic advice to the householders 
              living outside and having difficulties with fulfilling their daily 
              quota of chanting. All I know is that this is our most important 
              activity. At the time of initiation we vow to follow four regulative 
              principles, but this is just to help raise us to a civilised state. 
              The only other thing we vow is to chant at least sixteen rounds 
              of the maha-mantra daily. This is the center of our spiritual lifes. 
              Our founder-<i>acarya</i>, Shrila Prabhupada, said that if one only 
              does that throughout his lifetime, he will go back to Godhead. 
            <p>You call for a re-interpretation of the daily duty of chanting. 
              I am not sure if I understand what this means. In a sense, the chanting 
              was already re-interpreted 500 years ago by Lord Caitanya, who brought 
              it from the Vedic scriptures out to the public light (previously 
              only the brahmanas had access to it) and propagated it amongst all 
              people regardless their caste, creed and habits as the most easy 
              and joyous way to achieve love of Godhead in this fallen age. Then 
              it was re-interpreted once again by Srila Prabhupada, who, seeing 
              that his Western disciples were unable to chant 64 rounds a day 
              (as the Gaudiya Math devotees were obliged to do) lowered the quota 
              down to 32, and when they were still unable to chant that much, 
              he established the sixteen rounds as the absolute minimum. 
            <p>The experience of many devotees shows that decreasing this number, 
              even though it may seem to save time, does not help anything, rather 
              the contrary. If I ever happen to be in the circumstances of life 
              which will make my prescribed chanting impossible, I pray now for 
              the ability to pray then, with the feeling of a helpless child, 
              for Krsna to save me by removing obstacles to my chanting. It is 
              true that the Lord's grace is boundless and we should not fear He 
              will ever abandon us. And certainly we should never despise anyone, 
              even if he or she is not 'up to the standard.' Rather, we should 
              do anything we can to encourage and help. But the instructions of 
              the spiritual master are not the 'rulings' that should be abandoned 
              for surrender to Krsna. They are our path to surrender. 
            <p>I hope you don't mind my frank response to your article as it really 
              touched me. Please do continue with your frank appraisal of our 
              society and I would very much like to read more of your reflections 
              in the future. 
            <p> Your servant, <br>

            <p>In `ISKCON' at the Cross-roads' Dr. Julius Lipner makes a number 
              of important observations about ISKCON. As a religious scholar, 
              and not merely a scholar of religions, he wrote of his experiences 
              at an ISKCON Communications Seminar. 
            <p>In ISKCON he sees a religious groups towards which he experiences 
              considerable empathy. He is amongst a small, but growing number 
              of scholars who appreciate our efforts and the contribution we can 
              make to society. As a friendly observer, we may learn from him 'to 
              see ourselves as others see us', and as an academic with knowledge 
              of religious history, we can learn how to circumvent the classical 
              problems of other religious institutions. Some ISKCON leaders, I 
              know, will disagree, claiming that Vaishnava theology is sufficient 
              in itself to exempt its adherents from the philosophical wrangling 
              and schisms that have so plagued the Church. But a glimpse at ISKCON's 
              twenty five year history would sadly prove otherwise. Divinely revealed 
              theology is one thing and human nature something else entirely. 
              A religious institution is a fusion of the two and inasmuch as we 
              have philosophical parallels with religious bodies which have gone 
              before us, we can, to a greater or lesser extent, expect to confront 
              the same challenges. 
            <p>Take Dr. Lipner's first observation for example, of the classic 
              tension between monastic and missionary life. ISKCON as a group 
              is experiencing exactly the same dilemma that has confronted all 
              religions which have both pure practise and preaching at their hearts. 
              A recent study in America revealed that the 'spiritually informed' 
              public considered ISKCON to have 'the deepest, most consistent and 
              intellectually satisfying philosophy' of all the new religious movements, 
              but paradoxically the devotees of Krishna were perceived as being 
              'the least friendly of all the groups'. This was personally confirmed 
              to me by Walter Schwartz, religious correspondent of 'The Guardian' 
              newspaper who told me: 'I've always felt the devotees' activity 
              of chanting in the streets to be somewhat anti-social because they 
              are performing a religious activity in a public place with no explanation 
              of what they're doing'. Vaishnavas have worship which is private, 
              and outreach activities which are wholly public, but it is often 
              seen that the two do get mixed, particularly by the new convert 
              or by those who seem to think that personal purity is increased 
              in the face of public bewilderment or disapproval. 
            <p>Whilst the inevitable creation of barriers by such attitudes tends 
              to produce feelings of security and exclusivity within the neophyte 
              follower, it is certainly counter productive for missionary outreach 
              and ultimately, therefore, for the integrity of the religious body 
              as a whole. So often in history the monastic and the missionary 
              have tended to go their separate ways-to the detriment of both. 
              The two lifestyles do not often work together. In ISKCON so far 
              there has been a considerable achievement in that the two have been 
              reconciled to a position of `unity in diversity', but the mechanics 
              behind this balance should be properly understood for this harmony 
              to be maintained. 
            <p>The original phase of Vaishnavism's growth in the west was through 
              young, white, Judaeo-Christian converts. After the first two decades 
              of expansion predominantly based on literature sales and entrepreneurial 
              ability, the 'new Brahmins' found themselves without a supportive 
              culture of pious (generous) congregates and as a result the ISKCON 
              movement entered a period of grave social and financial instability. 
              As one religious consultant in England remarked: '18 million pieces 
              of literature over 20 years and you only have under 10,000 members-what 
              <i>have</i> you been doing?' 
            <p>Survival dictated that ISKCON improve its attention to nurturing, 
              guiding, and supporting the spiritual lives of those who had already 
              heard the message but who had not `converted' in the same way by 
              joining religious communities and thereby giving total commitment 
              to a missionary organisation. 
            <p>It is said that if constant recitation of the Holy Names does not 
              result in genuine compassion for others, something is wrong in one's 
              practise. Perhaps it may also be said that if compassionate outreach 
              does not result in a change of heart in others and a sustained growth 
              in the numbers of new members and, more importantly preservation 
              of the spiritual life of existing members, all may not be well with 
              the collective compassion. Dr. Lipner advises that we, 'shape the 
              future in the light of the past' and we would do well to heed him, 
              for isn't it written that 'those who do not know history are condemned 
              to repeat it'? 
            <p>I liked Dr. Lipner's use of the term 'fortress ISKCON' and 'the 
              theology of the drawbridge' and I'd like to think I understand what 
              he means. I personally believe 'our' Vaishnava philosophy to be 
              changeless, it's merely that the way in which we administer it within 
              a rapidly changing world calls for almost constant yet subtle changes 
              of approach. If that is what he means by 'forging a theology of 
              hope' then I believe it to be wholly consistent with Srila Prabhupada's 
              mood of preaching according to 'time, place and circumstance'. 
            <p>Much can be discussed, and is being discussed of Dr. Lipner's comments 
              on women in ISKCON. The experiment of celibates and female religious 
              co-operating together in a monastic/missionary institution has produced 
              many surprising successes as well as abuses. Many are the women, 
              who in their early years of ISKCON have been encouraged to become 
              preachers, interacting with dozens of men as a daily activity, thus 
              culturing within themselves (at the advice of their male leaders) 
              independence, assertiveness and the gentle art of firm persuasion, 
              only to then find after marriage, that the very opposite qualities 
              are prized by husbands desiring a model 'Vedic wife' (whatever that 
              may be). The particular difficulty is that it has no cultural antecedent 
              in India or Europe and perhaps in future years we will come to regard 
              it as an expedient measure, adopted within a particular social climate 
              rather than a blueprint for the future. 
            <p>ISKCON is a missionary organisation, slowly coming to terms with 
              its future identity as a fully integrated branch of human society. 
              Children of the early members do not yet have the benefit of a fully 
              developed and supportive social culture with concomitant educational 
              opportunities, employment possibilities, and a range of experienced 
              adults of all ages, occupations and degrees of religious commitment 
              to whom they may turn. Although ISKCON stands in opposition to the 
              popular Hindu practise of hereditary Brahminism, we implicitly practise 
              it with our own offspring, expecting that they too, like us, will 
              identify in their later years with a 'Vedic', yet still largely 
              missionary, religious culture. Yet children do not as a rule grow 
              to be what their parents expect them to be. Provision, and at least 
              expectation, for their future independence must therefore be made. 
            <p>The expectations of a highly exclusive religious group of their 
              next generation are also classical. Like the case of the rabbi's 
              son in Chaim Potok's 'The Chosen', parental pressure often produces 
              the reverse effect. True, we have a right as parents to expect that 
              our children will inherit the same religious values as we ourselves 
              hold dear, but for 'devotees' we should not read 'missionary workers 
              in ISKCON' and our education and training should reflect that. If, 
              due to over idealistic expectations we drive our young away, or 
              indeed, if, due to fear of this happening we neglect to give them 
              adequate training in our own morals and spirituality, then on both 
              counts we will be guilty. 
            <p>In conclusion, ISKCON's immediate challenge is that we must understand 
              what the essentials of Krishna consciousness are, how best to communicate 
              them, and especially how they are developed and preserved, both 
              by our children and new members ,amid an often un-supportive and 
              rapidly changing society.

              Virabhadra dasa </b> 
            <p>&nbsp;It is a pleasant feeling to go back in time and recall my 
              first encounter with Dr. Lipner, whom I first met at the ISKCON 
              Communications seminar at Radhadesh, Belgium in 1992. He struck 
              me as an honest and sensitive person whose qualities enable him 
              to perceive the subtlest characteristics of the people he happens 
              to meet, even for a short time; and this article, is somewhat showing 
              this fact. 
            <p>When the seminar was over and I was back in Italy, I had the chance 
              to exchange a couple of letters with him in order to get some bibliographical 
              advice, which I promptly received, and which was remarkably professional. 
              But now let's come to the themes that he has brought up in his article. 
              I have been an active member of ISKCON since 1984, still I must 
              say that I fully share many of his observations. In fact I don't 
              want to comment on Dr. Lipner points as much as offering some reflections 
              as far as the attitude one should have when dealing with this kind 
              of observations, which are more and more frequently brought to the 
              attention of the devotees by those who look at them from outside 
              of the movement. 
            <p>The real theme of this article is 'what to do with these observations'? 
              Dr. Lipner mentions that in 1992 our movement was facing a turning 
              point and that most likely we are still there; I would say this 
              is a fact. I think that there is a lot of updating and re-defining 
              to do, at least as far as the institution is concerned. 
            <p>Our engagement in doing this is not to disqualify our present institutional 
              arrangements but rather it indicates the healthy condition of a 
              movement which is observing itself and wants to improve. The absence 
              of stagnancy and a constant search for a transformation can undoubtedly 
              be a cause of growth and improvement. 
            <p>There are a few fundamental characteristics that a healthy social 
              body must have. One is a basic stability, which, in our case, rests 
              on the principle of <i>guru</i> [teacher] and <i>sastra</i> [scripture], 
              and another is a kind of more 'epidermal' restlessness which enables 
              the search for improvement to take place. This non-acceptance of 
              one's own present (the movement's present) can produce two different 
              kinds of results, just like everything else that exists in the world 
              of duality: on one hand it can lead to pessimism which turns into 
              discouragement and eventually defeat, and on the other hand it can 
              generate and feed healthy reform new perspectives and ultimately 
              a revitalised institution. This is a logical sequence because something 
              that is totally accepted, internally and externally, will never 
              undergo any amelioration, simply because one doesn't see the need 
              for it! 
            <p>Therefore, when facing some objective problems, like the one concerning 
              ISKCON's teenagers, or the other problems which were nicely presented 
              in Dr. Lipner's article, I think it would be useful and intelligent 
              for us to observe the whole thing using a 360° angle of vision, 
              and not with a unidirectional and tendentious outlook, which usually 
              turns into attributing the responsibility of what's going on to 
              the very subject in question. 
            <p>In jurisprudence it is advised that before one expresses a judgement, 
              one should 'wear' the dress of the representative of justice, but 
              one should also 'wear' the dress of the accused. This is the best 
              attitude one can have in order to approach a judgement with an open 
              perspective, avoiding in this way to become a victim of any possible 
              pre-judgement. 
            <p>I personally think it is very important for us to openly receive 
              the observations and opinions that come from outside of our movement, 
              especially when given by people with such a positive and benevolent 
              attitude as the one shown by Dr. Lipner. He obviously just wants 
              to offer a contribution to the movement by helping its social growth 
              and integration in the contemporary context of these troubled days. 
            <p>Still somebody might want to raise an objection: But isn't this 
              a questionable outlook, since we have the truth!?! But if this was 
              really the case, then we wouldn't have all the unsolved problems 
              we have and everything would 'already be solved'! Since it is not 
              so, we have to work to reach that stage of perfection, and on the 
              way let's try to take advantage of all the advice we can get almost 
              indiscriminately (taking them all into consideration at least hypothetically), 
              because Sri Krishna might use anyone to show us the way. 
            <p>Many great masters in our tradition such as Srila Rupa Goswami 
              (<i>Anasaktasya visayan...nirbhanda Krishna sambhande...</i>), Srila 
              Bhaktisiddhanta (<i>Hari sevaya yaha haya anukula ...</i>), Srila 
              Prabhupada (take the example of the swan, which can extract milk 
              from the water) and others like Canakya Pandita (one should accept 
              gold without discriminating where it comes from) have advised us 
              to develop the ability of catching positive direction from practically 
              everywhere, by seeing everything in relation to its source, Sri 
              Krishna. 
            <p>Certainly the way of dualistic judgement (black or white) appears 
              simpler and more easily applicable, but the integration of a holistic 
              judgement, which is complete and many faceted, is undoubtedly more 
              noble and <i>sattvic</i> [in goodness] and it brings honour to Sri 
              Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement.
