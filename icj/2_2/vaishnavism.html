            <p align=LEFT>Scholarship is a wiley animal. It has penetrating eyes 
              and a sharp tongue. It is a predator that lives on its wits, endowed 
              with phenomenal memory and keen intellect. It is adaptable, making 
              its home in almost any climate commanding respect from those around 
              it. It knows a variety of languages. It is energetic, alert, and 
              like most creatures of prey hungry for conquest. Ironically, scholarship 
              is also a lonely beast, for by nature it must remain aloof from 
              the territories it inhabits, never able to become a part of what 
              it observes. The object of its desire seems unattainable, as though 
              attainment were I betrayal of its own nature; it hunts for food 
              which it is cannot completely digest. 
            <p align=LEFT>Is there an Uncertainty Principle in scholarship which 
              says one can either objectively understand a subject's place in 
              the universe or subjectively realise the truth it contains, but 
              not both? It appears so, although some scholars have broken the 
              old and attained what they observed. In Gaudiya Vaisnava history, 
              Jiva Goswami, perhaps the most Prolific Indian theologian of the 
              16th century, dovetailed his erudition to a life of devotion after 
              meeting the great saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the 19th century, 
              Bhaktivinoda-Thakura found the object of his scholarship in a rare 
              copy of the Bhagavata Purana, gave up his magisterial duties and 
              dedicated himself to a life of devotion. But these are the rare 
              exceptions. 
            <p align=LEFT>An intriguing feature of author Steven Rosen's 25 interviews 
              (including four with Indian professors and two with women) is that 
              they permit us to observe an intelligent and deeply committed community 
              of scholars from behind a nearby curtain, to listen to them from 
              the next room, and what we see and hear is revealing: it is a profile 
              of people who have been given a glimpse of the object of desire, 
              a taste of the fruits of scholarship dangling inches from their 
              lips, and the ways in which they react. 
            <p align=LEFT>This unusual and fascinating insight into the scholarly 
              mind may not have been intentional. Steven Rosen did not intend 
              his book to be an expose of its subjects; he is not the Barbara 
              Walters of Indology. He set out questioning what is the Gaudiya 
              tradition, where did it come from and where is it going. The book 
              provides positive answers; some explicit answers: 
            <ul type="DISC">
              <li> Vaisnavism, like Christianity. is a living religion, numerically 
                the largest segment of modern Hinduism, as pervasive in India 
                as Christianity is in the western countries.</li>
              <li>The basic tenet of Vaisnavism is that we are spiritual beings 
                living in a material world. Consequently, we live on the surface 
                of emotions and know only the thinnest veneer of true experience. 
                Vaisnavas use practical methods, such as chanting and dramatic 
                performance, to revive spiritual emotion and reach the deeper, 
                spiritual levels of experience.</li>
              <li>Vaisnavism encompasses the most egalitarian of theologies: the 
                worship of Radha and Krsna. It is the only religious tradition 
                to recognise the pre-eminence of both the female and male aspects 
                of God. (This is most true of the Gaudiya tradition. In Judaism, 
                Kabbalists also recognise the dual aspects but do not emphasise 
                them.)</li>
              <li>Its goal, divine love of God, is not easily attained, but it 
                is attainable; there are self-realised Vaisnavas through history 
                whose lives provide us with examples to study and follow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The interviewees in this remarkable collection almost unanimously 
              describe a discovery eminent in their work; and those who do, while 
              demonstrating academic protocol and exercising professional restraint, 
              project a mood of excitement about their chosen field. It emerges, 
              however, only from between the lines of their replies and comments. 
              There is the impression that, in Studying vaisnavism, their Western 
              sensibilities underwent a transformation which they are prepared 
              to acknowledge-but discretely. If proximity to vaisnava doctrine 
              permitted a vision of life's mysteries that Western academic traditions 
              did not afford, the vision is to be discussed in subdued whispers. 
            <ul>
              <p>'What may have been meant by this is...' <br>
                'Perhaps what can be seen is...'<br>
                'Another way of understanding this might be...'<br>
                'As a scholar, all that I can say is...' 
            </ul>
            <p>From our vantage behind the nearby curtain, we sense people holding 
              back the emotional side of their understanding, as though it were 
              improper to reveal how deeply one can be touched by the discovery 
              of eternity or by other truths found in authentic spiritual traditions 
              such as Gaudiya Vaisnavism. The restraint may be politically correct, 
              but for readers it is distinctly uncomfortable; the elation of knowing 
              the soul's permanence, the soothing poetry of self-realisation, 
              the bliss of our place in transcendence are not mere sidebars to 
              the understanding of a people and a tradition. They are the essence. 
            <p>This reserve nay also be an inherent quality of the scholarly animal; 
              when it finds its prey, it dissects it ever so politely. There is 
              no bloodlust in scholarship. The closest it gets to raising its 
              adrenal flow may be the restrained awe these interviewees demonstrate. 
              And in that restraint, author Rosen has accomplished his purpose: 
              the substantiation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism as an authentic spiritual 
              tradition, not a religious cult; based on.history and theology, 
              not emotion and sentiment. 
            <p>Religion is by nature an ecstatic experience. It was the loss of 
              the ecstatic experience that sent entire communities of young people 
              scurrying East in their search for spiritual fulfillment and triggered 
              the subsequent brouhaha over cults and brainwashing. Rosen's subliminal 
              message is to not throw the rice out with the rinse water. Not all 
              Indian religious movements to have emerged from the '60s are panafrangi-flavored 
              panaceas to a spiritually depleted America. Just see how excited 
              this group of scholars gets over Gaudiya vaisnavism! 
            <p>The book serves its purpose well. There is very little information 
              on Bengal from the 13th to the 18th centuries. In his effort to 
              substantiate the authority and historicity of Gaudiya Vaisnavism, 
              Rosen has pieced together a significant document in the form of 
              interviews with contemporary scholars and historians. 
            <p>Rosen is a subversive writer, if somewhat obviously so: his interviews 
              stack neatly one on the other, forming a well reasoned validation 
              of the Gaudiya tradition. Ho even manages to adhere to the sastric 
              rule of reserving deeper, more intimate subjects for the final few 
              chapters, much like the Bhagavatam, which admonishes aspirants to 
              study carefully the first nine' Cantos before attempting to penetrate 
              the pastimes of Krsna and the gopis described in the tenth.' Rosen's 
              role as an interviewer is, nonetheless, qualified by is desire to 
              rectify what he sees as misconceptions. 
            <p>His talk with associate professor and Chaitanyite biographer Tony 
              Stewart, for example, explores the concept of inspirational writing. 
              He argues eloquently for the theological authority of experiential 
              texts, such as the Vaisnava dramas. Since Chaitanya's time, such 
              dramas and the accompanying songs (kirtana) were held up as evidence 
              of the Vaisnava community's sentimentality. The clear distinction 
              between the deviant behaviour of pseudo-Vaisnavas (sahajiyas) and 
              the real thing is made emphatically clear. Rosen's interview with 
              author and professor William Deadwyler drives the point home even 
              deeper. 
            <p>There is an interesting blend to Rosen's choice of interviewees. 
              There are luminaries, the elite of Indian studies, mixed with less 
              recognised spokespeople. Some are eloquent about their subject, 
              others less so in communicating their particular focus. The thread 
              of eminent discovery binds them all. 
            <p>It is an ironic mismatch, scholarship and the religious experience. 
              Scholarship looks to make intelligible, breaks things down into 
              cause and effect, describes its observations in sequential narrative. 
              The religious experience, in its pure form, is not rational, disobeys 
              rule of logic and reason, and the closer scholarship approaches 
              its core the more religion laughs at its formal attempts to classify 
              and describe. By drawing on a crosssection of the Vaisnava community-practitioners 
              as well as observers-Rosen's work manages to temper the irony with 
              insight and occasional flashes of wit. 
            <p><i>Vaisnavism: Contemporary Scholars Discuss the Gaudiya Tradition</i> 
              is in places an esoteric work. So are the deeper discussions in 
              most religious traditional like treasure maps drawn with the intention 
              of dissuading less determined seekers. If treasure were easily attained, 
              we'd all be rich. If ecstasy were cheap, we'd all be smiling. (One 
              feels sympathy for teachers such as Dan Smith who struggles to keep 
              his students interested in the numerous battles of Valmiki's epic, 
              tale <i>Ramayana</i>.) 
            <p>Treasure maps are also just that: maps showing the way to a destination. 
              For anyone looking to go the extra distance in their search for 
              enlightenment, here is a compact work that points out the blind 
              alleys and pitfalls as well as the major highways and backroads 
              of Vaisnavism.
