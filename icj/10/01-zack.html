           <h2>A Dispute Resolution
             Programme for ISKCON</h2>
           <p>Arnold M. Zack<BR>with
input by Braja Bihari Dasa</p>

           <blockquote>
             <p><em>In this
               paper Arnold Zack, an expert in the field of dispute resolution,
               plots the progress and development of an ISKCON that can deal with
               internal disputes in a timely, fair, and mature way. Can ombudsmen
               and mediators, with their increasing acceptance in civil society,
               work in a religious organisation such as ISKCON? Can ISKCON show that
               the transparency of an institution can enhance the dedication and
               devotion of its followers?</em></p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>We live in a world
of increasing tensions and conflicts. The expansion of education and
rapid strides in telecommunication that have made for a shrinking
world can also make us more aware of our perceived entitlements and
enhance our tendency to assert our perceived rights. This can lead to
an escalation of confrontation and disputes. That is true among
nations, among societies, within corporate institutions, and even
within religious organisations.</p>

<p><B>The end of the
&lsquo;all-powerful church&rsquo;</B></p>

<p>Long gone is the era
where religious institutions could rely on their authority over this
life and the afterlife to bring conformity to their precepts and
submission to their priests. Recent scandals involving child abuse in
the Catholic Church, for example, demonstrate the impact that
suppression of protest and strict conformity to the dictates of
leadership can have on congregants who have suffered wrongs that, in
civil society, would have been early exposed and punished.</p>

<p>Suppressed and
unreported wrongs will be uncovered in the end and impose a high
penalty on any institution that doesn&rsquo;t deal with such issues
in a prompt and transparent fashion. There is evidence that belated
exposure of wrongdoing exacts a toll on the institution that may be
out of proportion to the long-passed alleged wrong, diverting its
resources and energy away from its legitimate administrative and
charitable obligations and its theological responsibilities.
Furthermore, the success of claimants engaging in litigation against
the institution tends to provide a further stimulus to more
accusations, while leaving the less vocal and quiescent devotees and
members isolated with unresolved issues of trust and faith and no
comfortable channel through which to voice their concerns. The core
mission of the institution is thus diverted into a defensive
machinery to protect it from protests by the very members and
devotees who should be rallying to its higher purpose and who should
be its supporters and eager followers. The leadership of the
institution, instead of being beyond the fray, is an active
participant in the battle, even further eroding its expected position
of leadership and respect.</p>

<p>Religious
institutions, unlike civil societies or states, have usually held
themselves exempt from accountability. The mentoring and stewarding
or shepherding role of such leadership contradicts the grants of
voice and rights that are such integral parts of the social contract
of our civil societies.</p>

<p><B>The civil model
and alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</B></p>

<p>In a civil society
the leadership provides rules and it also provides procedures for
challenging violations of those rules. Laws are enacted by edict or
by democratic legislation and in most societies a procedure is
provided where citizens can challenge unacceptable interpretation or
application of those laws, with unresolved disputes being appealed to
an independent judiciary to determine whether or not the laws have
been violated. Evolving experience within that adversarial system has
led more and more societies and institutions to develop informal
procedures that help avoid resort to litigation and the courts.
Aversion to the system has been intensified by growing distrust of
the system, its reliance on lawyers, and intensified resort to
depositions, discovery, and endless appeals that have made the courts
into an increasingly unacceptable battleground.</p>

<p><em>The ombudsman</em></p>
<p>In an effort to
avoid the pitfalls of litigation and the courts, Scandinavian
governments introduced the concept of the ombudsman: a person,
provided by the government, to whom the average citizen could appeal
when traditional routes of complaint and administration proved
unsuccessful. The ombudsman was the champion of the citizen seeking
equity from government when it was unattainable through normal
administrative channels. The ombudsman would receive the citizen&rsquo;s
complaint in confidence and then provide guidance as to where the
complaint should be properly processed, or undertake to resolve the
dispute as the claimant&rsquo;s advocate within the government
agency. This is a means of meeting citizens&rsquo; needs and an
effective and expeditious tool for bypassing bureaucracy to bring
about equitable outcomes of citizens&rsquo; complaints.</p>

<p>The ombudsman system
has been recognised as an efficient means of achieving peaceful
resolution of complaints without the cost, publicity, and
confrontations that too often occur in more conventional channels of
administrative or legal appeals. Ombudsman services are provided in
many government and private institutions throughout the world as a
private and confidential process for avoiding confrontation and
improving the credibility and bona fides of the providing institution
among its citizens or members who are able to speedily and privately
dispose of troublesome issues.</p>

<p><em>The mediator</em></p>

<p>Another procedure of
increasing acceptability and effectiveness is the concept of
mediation. Mediation is provided to help disputing individuals within
an institution resolve disputes that might otherwise escalate into
serious disruption of the workforce or the citizenry. Simple
interpersonal disputes can escalate into group conflict in the
absence of a process for reducing or resolving the dispute in a
timely and peaceful process. The mediator should be a readily
available facilitator that both disputants use to reduce the issues
in dispute so that the personal relationship is able to continue
without the baggage of the festering dispute.</p>

<p>In mediation, unlike
in litigation, the mediator persuades the disputants to work toward
their own resolution. The mediator does not impose any decision,
instead nudging the parties toward a mutual resolution of their
dispute. By this procedure disputants can avoid the continued
escalation of conflict, which could otherwise lead to the parties
themselves losing control over the outcome; for example in litigation
or administrative decision by the institution.</p>

<p><em>Recognition of the need for alternative
dispute resolution</em></p>

<p>In many societies
the courts have come to recognise that it is better for disputants to
resolve their disputes than to submit them to judicially imposed
outcomes. Before asserting jurisdiction and taking the issue from the
control of the parties themselves, courts have encouraged disputants
to try to mediate their conflicts. These two alternative dispute
resolution systems, ombudsmen and mediation, are increasingly
accepted as alternatives to traditional litigation and use of the
courts. They have become common in government institutions, in
private institutions and in international organisations; but, till
now, they have not been adopted by any international religious
organisation.</p>

<p><B>Alternative
dispute resolution in religious organisations</B></p>

<p>A strong case can be
made for providing dispute resolution systems not only for the
benefit of the members or devotees, but also for the benefit of the
leadership and for the benefit of the religious institution itself.</p>

<p>Below are some of
the issues to be considered in determining whether a religious
organisation, such as ISKCON, should adopt an alternative dispute
resolution procedure.</p>

<p><em>Impact on the membership</em></p>

<p>For the member or
devotee the availability of an alternative dispute resolution system
operated by trained neutral ombudsmen and/or mediators can provide
many advantages and avoid many perils.</p>
<UL>
	<LI><p>It is a readily
	available vehicle for registering timely complaints when they are
	fresh in the mind; when information surrounding the claim or the
	incident is readily available, and when the focus of the claimant is
	on the issue itself and not on the way it might have been ignored,
	dismissed, or delayed.</p>
	<LI><p>It can provide
	a sense of worth on the part of the individual claimant. It
	indicates that their concerns are worthy of consideration and
	treatment by the institution.</p>
	<LI><p>It indicates
	that the leadership does not dismiss complaints as unworthy
	challenges to their power or authority.</p>
	<LI><p>It provides a
	sense of transparency within the institution; a sense that the
	institution recognises that there will be unrest or concerns, and
	that raising such issues and focusing on their resolution is not a
	challenge to the integrity of the institution but an endorsement of
	the institution&rsquo;s willingness to listen, discuss, and resolve.</p>
	<LI><p>It avoids the
	intensification of unrest and the spread of dismay as individuals
	express their frustrations with the system, and the rise of
	resentment over the refusal of the institution&rsquo;s leadership to
	listen to complaints. The failure to listen, rather than the initial
	dispute, can become the focus of unrest and dissatisfaction with the
	leadership and its handling of issues that might have initially been
	of minimal consequence.</p>
	<LI><p>It avoids the
	departure of thinking and outspoken adherents who might leave the
	formal institutional structure out of frustration at the
	leadership&rsquo;s perceived lack of concern over issues that
	trouble the membership.</p>
</UL>

<p><em>Impact on the leadership</em></p>

<p>A dispute resolution
system is beneficial not only to the devotees, but to the leadership
and the institution itself.</p>
<UL>
	<LI><p>It provides a
	readily available method of resolving disputes, on their own merit,
	before they evolve into group disputes based on refusal to deal with
	the initial complaint.</p>
	<LI><p>It provides an
	opportunity to learn where problems are evolving, facilitating
	assessment of whether they can be corrected or avoided by
	administrative or personnel adjustments.</p>
	<LI><p>It provides a
	back-channel procedure for quietly resolving complaints. This helps
	all parties save face and get on with the real purpose of the
	organisation.</p>
	<LI><p>It enables the
	leadership, where appropriate, to avoid formal decision-making and
	side-taking. A side-effect of formal appeals is that they can result
	in antagonising larger numbers of adherents.</p>
	<LI><p>It creates an
	environment of member participation and challenge that can enhance
	the transparency and vitality of the institution. The institution is
	seen as being able to withstand, and even welcome, such member
	activity and challenge.</p>
	<LI><p>It shows
	non-adherents the vitality and transparency of the institution as a
	welcoming and dynamic environment worthy of joining.</p>
</UL>

<p><strong>Alternative dispute resolution in
ISKCON</strong></p>

<p>Early in 2001,
ISKCON&rsquo;s GBC (Governing Body Commission) authorised one of its
deputy members, Braja Bihari Dasa, to explore the development of an
alternative dispute resolution system for ISKCON. During the summer
of 2001, Madhava-pandita Dasa discussed with me his interest in
studying mediation in the hope that he could use it to help resolve
some of the interpersonal, and intergenerational issues that he felt
were weakening ISKCON. I agreed that informal dispute resolution
systems could help resolve disputes that would otherwise impede the
higher purposes of an institution and so Madhava-pandita Dasa placed
me in contact with Burke Rochford, who provided me with the studies
he had made of ISKCON, and with Kalakantha Dasa, who arranged for me
to visit the ISKCON Community in Alachua, Florida. There I learned
more about some of the problems facing the institution and suggested
the use of some of the conflict resolution tools that have been
successful in reducing conflict in governmental and private
institutions.</p>

<p>In particular I
considered the ombudsman system as a useful way for devotees to
express concerns that they might have with the establishment
leadership but that they might be reluctant to raise formally or
visibly for fear of antagonising their mentors or jeopardising their
future role within the institution. The ombudsman system could also
provide a valuable tool for the GBC to resolve issues quietly without
having to &lsquo;take sides&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I view the mediation
function as being better suited to interpersonal disputes between
devotees and higher ranking individuals, where both recognise that a
prior incident might have soured their relationship, and where both
seek to remove that obstacle to reconciliation to avoid its long term
poisoning impact.</p>

<p>The introduction of
mediation into the structure of ISKCON seemed to be consistent with
its philosophical beliefs. Krsna Himself tried to settle the dispute
before the battle of Kuruksetra, and the movement&rsquo;s founder,
Srila Prabhupada, was often involved in ironing out disputes amongst
his disciples. Indeed, Prabhupada requested his disciples to
cooperate as a sign of love for him, and stated that ISKCON&rsquo;s
potential failure would only come about due to internal conflict and
impurities, not external threats. Prabhupada even indicated that much
of the demise of his Guru&rsquo;s mission came about due to
in-fighting amongst godbrothers.</p>

<p>Mediation appeared
so well suited to this institution that I could foresee its
introduction into the curriculum of ISKCON schools, teaching
youngsters the benefits of discussion, negotiation, and compromise in
resolving personal disputes. Peer mediation, the introduction of
negotiation, and mediation training and role-playing have become
popular in elementary and middle schools in North American and
elsewhere as a programme for teaching more harmonious relationships
between youngsters. The goal is to train a whole generation of
students in the skills of negotiation and mediation so that as adults
they can be more sensitive in their interpersonal relations and more
willing to employ negotiation and mediation in their dealings with
others. It would be wonderful if that facility were built into the
training of future generations of ISKCON devotees so that they would
be sensitive to the use of mediation to resolve disputes with their
fellow devotees and even more so in their dealings with associates
outside ISKCON.</p>
<p>Having been
impressed by the contemplative nature of many of the good listeners I
met in my introductory experiences with ISKCON, I considered many
devotees I met as having the innate qualifications to be good
mediators and anticipated that, with training, they might be able not
only to resolve disputes within ISKCON, but also gain the skills that
could make them acceptable as mediators outside ISKCON, opening up
the opportunity to work professionally as mediators in the outside
world. I projected that if enough devotees could be trained in
societies where mediation was an accepted vehicle for resolving
disputes, then entrance into this field might help to improve the
image of ISKCON devotees to one where they would be viewed as
peacemakers in the communities in which they live and practice.</p>
<p><B>Implementing
alternative dispute resolution in ISKCON</B></p>

<p>Following the
Alachua meeting I was invited to attend and make a presentation at
the annual meeting of the GBC in Mayapur, India, on 9 March 2002. In
that presentation I set forth my rationale for the establishment of a
programme for dispute resolution within ISKCON. The following day the
GBC issued a statement of support for the undertaking and urged its
initiation. Its undertaking reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resolution<BR>
    <BR>
    Whereas,
    the GBC seeks to assure devotees of their interest in their concern,
    and seeks to encourage the timely voluntary resolution of disputes
    within ISKCON,</p>
  <p>Whereas, the
    universal practice of international organisations is to provide
    machinery of prompt resolution of internal disputes,</p>
  <p>And whereas it is
    universally accepted that ombudsmen provide an effective and
    confidential means of addressing individual concerns with the
    organisation,</p>
  <p>And whereas it is
    universally accepted that mediation entered into voluntarily by two
    disputant parties with the help of a trained mediator is a proven
    procedure for resolving interpersonal disputes to the mutual
    satisfaction of the disputants.</p>
  <p>It is resolved that:
    The GBC announces the universal support of the establishment of a
    voluntary dispute resolution system to facilitate the resolution of
    members concerns.</p>
  <p>To accomplish this
    end, we unanimously urge regions and local temples to undertake the
    establishment of regional based ombudsman and mediation structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Members of the GBC
pledge their support in the development of these structures and in
being responsive to the concerns of members brought to their
attention through these processes.</p>

<p>A sub-committee of
Braja Bihari Dasa, Madhava-pandita Dasa, and Arnold M. Zack shall
coordinate these efforts on behalf of the GBC body.</p>

<p>Following the
meeting, the next stage was to develop a programme which would:
spread word of the GBC commitment; develop a structure for
implementation of its objectives on an international and regional
basis; educate members as to the nature and workings of an ombudsman
and mediator and how they would fit into the ISKCON structure; select
effective ombudsmen; train mediators for service on a regional or
broader basis; develop an administrative focus for individuals with
complaints seeking to use the procedure; and make these services
available outside of ISKCON. Throughout this undertaking we were
guided by the principal of transparency and have sought to keep
devotees and members up to date on our efforts. We have also to be
guided by the fact that the GBC, under financial pressure, has had
limited funds available to help in the implementation of the
programme it so enthusiastically endorsed.</p>

<p><em>Spreading the word of the GBC
endorsement</em></p>

<p>Following the
meeting in Mayapur, a report of my presentation was listed on the
Mayapur web page (www.mayapur.com). In addition to the GBC
Resolution, the announcement of our programme was posted on a number
of ISKCON web pages such as Chakra (www.chakra.org). Since then, we
have provided updates of our plans and undertakings to users of PAMHO
(ISKCON&rsquo;s internal e-mail system), Chakra, and VNN
(www.vnn.org), soliciting comments and suggestions as to how we
should proceed. The great majority of the responses were
commendations of the undertaking and encouragements of our efforts.</p>

<p>There were some
negative responses from those who viewed our undertaking as being
material solutions to essentially spiritual problems, or who felt
that we should only use those methods used by previous teachers in
the Vaisnava tradition.&nbsp;It therefore needs to be made clear that
alternative dispute resolution is intended as a proper implementation
of the principle of <I>yukta-vairagya</I>: using material nature in
Krsna&rsquo;s service. Alternative dispute resolution is meant to be
a practical system to serve ISKCON.</p>

<p>We also solicited,
and received a number of responses from, devotees with experience in
mediation and in mediation training.</p>

<p><I>Developing
regional structures</I></p>

<p>Although there were
representatives of all regions at the Mayapur meeting of the GBC, and
although invitations were offered to visit all regions, we opted for
the development of regional programmes in North America and in Europe
as initial efforts to demonstrate the feasibility of the programme.
Accordingly, measures were undertaken to speak to the North American
region at its meeting in New Vrindavan in West Virginia in May 2002,
and to the European region at its meeting at Radhadesh in Belgium in
September 2002. Our goal was to speak to the local devotees at those
meetings as well as to Temple Presidents, GBC members, and other
leaders who were present and to develop, with them, a programme for
each region.</p>

<p>In the New Vrindavan
meeting we solicited devotees in attendance to determine who had had
mediation training or experience. We spoke to Vrajalila Dasi, who had
done considerable international training of mediators and devotees to
familiarise them with the workings of the process, and Krsna-lila
Dasi, who has spent a career training mediators for the New York
Public School system. We determined to encourage Vrajalila to talk to
temples and devotees about the use and procedures of mediation, and
to use Krsna-lila to lead our initial mediator training programme
scheduled for September 2002 at Towaco, New Jersey.</p>

<p>We posted a notice
of the proposed training, offering a 40 hour, five day, certificate
course in mediation for $30. We determined to make the course
available to all who wished to attend in the expectation that it:
would yield some graduates we would be willing to endorse and offer
as mediators; would enable others to rely on the training if they
sought work outside ISKCON as mediators; and, at the very least,
would familiarise more devotees with the process and help advertise
the value of the training in terms of self-examination and enhancing
skills in dealing with other people.</p>

<p>While at New
Vrindavan we learned of a training programme being conducted at the
Vancouver Temple and have been in communication with the trainers in
that programme to integrate their activities into our project.</p>

<p>We also spoke with
North American leaders about our suggestions for ombudsmen to serve
in that region and to be available elsewhere. We also discussed
initial plans for the development of a structure for processing cases
from devotee inquiries into the ombudsman and mediation channels.</p>

<p>In June 2002, we met
with the leaders of the Radhadesh community in Belgium where leaders
from several other countries were also in attendance. In addition to
planning for a European mediation training programme in late 2002 we
also made plans for assisting the funding of European attendants from
several countries, and identified individuals who might serve as
European based ombudsmen. Arrangements were made for including a unit
on ADR for the Bhaktivedanta College at Radhadesh, and for returning
to meet the European GBC leadership at their September meeting where
we proposed to discuss the development of training programmes within
the region.</p>

<p>Our expectation was
that, with our experience in North America and in Europe, we would
gain experience on the development process and other regions would
learn of our approach and provide further opportunities for us to
develop comparable programmes in other regions. Our objective for the
first year is to extend our efforts to Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, and possibly India. Our hope is that once we have regional
training programmes in place and have spoken with the leadership and
attendees at their regional meetings, we will be in a better position
to cooperate with national and temple groups in helping to develop
mediation training programmes, hopefully in local languages, to make
sensitive mediators more widely available and to move toward our
ultimate objective of training large numbers of devotees in mediation
so that they will have the skills to offer their services as
mediators outside ISKCON.</p>

<p><em>Educating members about the processes</em></p>

<p>We aim to bring the
message of our programme to as many devotees and members as possible
through the web, regular updates, and participation in regional
meetings. We have discussed the creation of a web page for our
project where we plan to post information and articles on various
aspects of mediation and dispute resolution, as well as listings of
approved mediation training programmes in countries where we might
not be able to develop our own programme. Once we have had mediation
courses in the regions currently under discussion we expect to
provide refresher courses, courses for mediator trainees, and access
to mediation training in fields other than the interpersonal
relationships on which we are currently focusing.</p>

<p>We also hope to use
our training, talks, postings, and networking to encourage the
development of peer mediation programmes for students at ISKCON
schools. One pilot peer mediation programme is presently being start
at the Gurukula in Vrndavana, India. We also want to encourage and
train devotees who would like to establish peer-mediation programmes
outside of ISKCON, in school systems around the world; there is a
ready market for such work.</p>
<p><I>Selecting
the ombudsmen</I></p>
<p>We are carefully
identifying individuals within ISKCON to serve as ombudsmen. It is
important that they have credibility among devotees and the GBC.</p>

<p>For the first year
we want to develop a roster of six ombudsmen who would be
representative of the various constituencies within ISKCON (male,
female, temple devotee, congregant, young and old) as well as from
different ethnic groupings, so that devotees seeking to use the
ombudsman service would be comfortable in selecting someone in whom
they had confidence.</p>

<p>We decided against
soliciting self-nominations for ombudsmen in favour of selection. We
felt that asking for volunteers would unrealistically raise
expectations of devotees that they would be used as ombudsmen when
the reality is that those serving as ombudsmen require a certain
temperament, a reputation for protecting confidentiality, and an
access to, and acceptability by, GBC leadership to function
effectively.</p>

<p>Although none of
those selected have yet undertaken to attend the ombudsman training
programmes that are available, we expect that such attendance would
be part of their developing expertise in this field. Some devotees,
who would benefit from using the ombudsman process, have already
brought some issues to our attention and efforts are underway to
proceed with those initial concerns.</p>

<p><I>Training
mediators </I></p>

<p>There a number of
devotees, with experience as trainers in various types of mediation,
that have come forward and offered to help train ISKCON mediators.
Our initial focus is on mediation of interpersonal, rather than
institutional, disputes. After our first training sessions we will
assess whether it meets what we anticipate to be the needs within
ISKCON. We can then adjust the content in later training or for
training in other regions and may provide updates if we think our
initial approach was less than relevant.</p>

<p>The training we use
is a 40-hour course spread over five days, with considerable emphasis
on role playing and mock mediations. The course is open to all who
want to take it, with a limit of 25 per course. Only after we have
observed the performance of the trainees will we make any
determination as to whether we think they would be effective in our
programme. Those who are chosen will be placed on our roster of
mediators, which will be made available to those seeking to use the
service.</p>

<p>Once the course is
completed, we would expect to provide those on the roster with case
studies of completed mediations (names excised) so they get a sense
of the types of issues confronted in the programme, and we would use
those case studies and the mediators of those cases for refresher
training in regular regional meetings.</p>

<p>We will also develop
a standard for adding to our roster the names of devotees who have
prior mediation experience but have not taken the course. Their
inclusion would be based on the effectiveness of their service, the
areas where they have mediated, and our assessment of their potential
usefulness to our programme. We would set a threshold number of
completed mediations that would be the basis for entry onto the
roster without our training.</p>

<p><I>Establishing
the administrative structure</I></p>

<p>The administrative
structure would oversee intake of potential ombudsman or mediation
cases as well as funding and other administration. We anticipate an
individual administrator working with the assistance of an advisory
committee of leaders who are supportive of the programme and who are
endorsed in that role by the GBC</p>

<p>The confidentiality
that is so crucial to the success of the ombudsman programme should
enable a complainant to bypass the administrative structure and make
initial contact directly with the preferred ombudsman; although there
would be no problem with a devotee coming to the administrator and
asking referral to an ombudsman.</p>

<p>In the case of
mediation the administrator may have a larger role to play. Of
course, if two devotees jointly agree that they have a dispute that
could be effectively mediated they could choose any mediator they
wish, even if that person is not on our roster. However, if one party
is eager to mediate with another, but the other party is either
unaware of the interest, or unwilling to partake, then the
administrator can be approached to attempt to induce the reluctant or
refusing party into mediation. In a sense the administrator would
also be a mediator, mediating one of the parties into the process.
There may be other cases where a third party thinks that a
deteriorating relationship between two people would benefit from
mediation. In such a case the administrator might approach the two
individuals jointly or individually to offer the services of the
office to help resolve their conflict.</p>

<p>The administrator
would maintain the roster of mediators and add names when approved by
the advisory committee. The administrator would also serve to
finalise and process any written agreements that might result from
mediations.</p>

<p>We are currently
considering the appropriate funding vehicle for the office.
Hopefully, mediators would be willing to serve on a pro bono basis,
similar to the judges who serve in ISKCON&rsquo;s Child Protection
Office. But we can envision the day when there is sufficient demand
on the services of certain mediators that their heavy dedication of
time to the work would justify their seeking compensation for their
services. If the roster is tapped by outside users then certainly the
mediators would be justified in charging fees. Accordingly we are
proposing a mediator roster to be published in our ADR web page,
which would list the background of each roster member, including
mediation courses taken, the number and nature of cases mediated
(with names of parties excised) and whether or not they will charge
ISKCON devotees for their services. Those seeking to use roster
members would then be on notice of the charges for such services and
the paid mediator would be able to deal directly with parties and
receive compensation from them. For those serving pro bono, their
selection and reimbursement of their expenses would be handled by the
administrator from funds collected from the disputants, or from funds
provided by the local temple, GBC, or benefactors of the programme.</p>

<p><I>Making ISKCON
neutrals available to the outside world</I></p>

<p>ISKCON devotees
could make good mediators. The foregoing programme has the components
and transparency that would enable ISKCON mediators to offer their
services to the wider world. In my estimation, every citizen would
benefit from some training on communication, negotiation, and
mediation. The training programme we are championing is one that
could benefit all ISKCON devotees and congregants. If the culture of
ISKCON can become one that is known for its knack and effectiveness
in resolving disputes within the institution, then it would follow
that there would be a call upon its members to provide mediation
services for disputants outside the institution. Mediation is an
increasingly accepted and used process for resolving disputes
worldwide, particularly as society becomes more and more concerned
with the costs, delays, and loss of control to litigation and the
courts. This might be a prime time for ISKCON to develop
dispute-settlement experience for its members to use for their
professional advancement in society at large.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Whatever else may
happen, knowledge of negotiation and dispute resolution among members
would certainly go a long way to aligning ISKCON&rsquo;s culture to
one more in keeping with the concerns of its founder, Srila
Prabhupada:</p>
<p>We have
so much work to do, we cannot lose our solidarity. Do not cause a
crack there with any fighting spirit or competition. Whenever I hear
complaints or disturbances in our centres my mind becomes ...
disturbed and I cannot properly translate my books. So please spare
me from such disturbance by cooperating all together, Godbrothers and
Godsisters.<SUP><a href="#1">1</a></SUP><a name="1b"></a></p>
<p>Remember
the story in Aesop's Fables of the father of many children with the
bundle of sticks. When the father asked his children to break the
bundle of sticks wrapped in a bag, none of them could do it. But,
when they removed the sticks from the bag, and tried one by one, the
sticks were easily broken. So this is the strength in unity. If we
are bunched up, we can never be broken, but when divided, then we can
become broken very easily.<SUP><a href="#2">2</a></SUP><a name="2b"></a></p>

<p>This paper presents
our initial efforts at a vital experiment, vital not only to
establish a culture of dispute resolution within ISKCON, but also
vital to determine if a religious institution, such as ISKCON, can
apply the concepts and standards which governments and businesses
have come to accept as crucial for avoiding conflict and reducing
tensions within their institutions. If it succeeds, ISKCON will have
made an important contribution to the ability of its members and
devotees to raise and discuss issues that are ultimately of mutual
concern. It will also have made an inspiring contribution to world
religions by showing that the transparency of its institution
enhances the dedication and devotion of its followers.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>

<p>Since the writing of
this article, Arnold Zack and Braja Bihari Dasa attended the March
2003 ISKCON GBC meetings in Mayapur, India. There they presented
their accomplishments for the year: training courses in the US,
Europe and India; 70 trained mediators; nearly 100 cases mediated and
about 15 ombudsman cases. They also presented plans for training
courses in Russia, Hungary, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, England, and the west coast and south-eastern USA.</p>

<p>At the meetings the
GBC Executive Committee delegated issues brought to them to mediators
to attempt to work out differences. Six such issues were successfully
dealt with in that way during the ten days of meetings. Such
differences usually consume much time at the GBC meetings.</p>

<p>The GBC body also
voted to allocate sufficient funds for the on-going progress of this
project.</p>
