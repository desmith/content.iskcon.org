<p><strong>&lsquo;Counselling,
Therapy, and Social Care: A Krsna
Conscious Perspective&rsquo;<br>
31 May &ndash; 1 June 2003 &mdash;
ISKCON Potomac, USA</strong></p>
<p><a href="99-biodata.html#cd">Candramukhi Dasi and Aghari Dasa</a> </p>
<p>From 31 May to1 June
2003 ISKCON Communications hosted a mental health conference on
&lsquo;Counselling, Therapy, and Social Care: A Krsna
Conscious Perspective&rsquo; at ISKCON Potomac. Attendees included
devotees interested or working in the helping professions as well as
ISKCON leaders and congregational members.</p>

<p>The programme began
with Bhakti-tirtha Swami presenting from his new book on the mind and
psychology, specifically on the topic of Vaisnavas
coping with grief. His presentation included an overview of the
grieving process and stages of grief, as well as an interactive
component wherein participants broke up into groups for further
process work. He facilitated exploration of grief experiences and in
role-playing scenarios from the time of death in which important
relationships and communications with loved ones may have gone
unattended. This was a very moving experience and helped set the mood
for the entire conference.</p>

<p>Next Chandramukhi
Dasi and Aghari Dasa facilitated a socio-drama performance. Picking
up on the themes evoked during Bhakti-tirtha Swami&rsquo;s exercises,
the group enacted a disputed intimate relationship between devotees
living &lsquo;inside&rsquo; and &lsquo;outside&rsquo; of
temple/<I>asrama</I> life. Several people participated and filled the
roles of family members and comrades on both sides of the dispute.
The enactment intensified when existential time of death context was
added to the developing drama. The workshop was emotionally rewarding
for the group.</p>

<p>Visnu-gada Dasa
presented on &lsquo;Psychological Testing and its History&rsquo;. The
evolution of testing and its scientific basis was described and its
efficacy for use in addressing devotee mental health and psychosocial
problems was discussed. He also discussed the ethics of guru-disciple
relationships and confidentiality, engaging the participants in an
interactive discussion of these topics. Almost everyone present was
stimulated by the relevance and need for pursuing a better
understanding of all devotee relationships, especially between guru
and disciple.</p>

<p>At the request of
ISKCON leaders, VAC (Vaisnava Alliance of Care Providers) facilitated
a panel discussion on spousal abuse and family violence. Panel
members included Jagannatha Pandita Dasa, Citralekha Dasi,
Arcana-siddhi Dasi, Aghari Dasa (Masters in Counselling Psychology)
and Anuttama Dasa (Director of ISKCON Communications). The panel was
facilitated by Chandramukhi Dasi (Masters in Counselling Psychology).
Discussions included the cycle of violence, internet websites and
phone hotline information, community resources for victims,
frustration and concern surrounding recurring patterns of
victim/offenders, as well as the economic realities confronting women
and family members attempting to achieve independence or
self-sufficiency after leaving abusive relationships. Empowerment of
women and accountability of men was discussed at length. Peer
counselling within male circles and the need for men to take
responsibility for developing intimacy was emphasised.</p>

<p>The first day ended
with Jaya Sacisuta Dasa presenting the results of his research study
on &lsquo;The Modes of Nature and Personality in Academia: Its
Implications for Mental Health Care, Psychopathology, and Behavioural
Sciences&rsquo;. He detailed his use and further development of Dhira
Govinda Dasa&rsquo;s research model regarding the modes of nature and
personality theory. He is also endeavouring to expand research on the
effectiveness of the Hare Krsna
mantra in treatment systems. The participants appreciated his
research and its implications for extending the viability of
Prabhupada&rsquo;s teachings into academic and clinical settings.</p>

<p>On the second day,
Cintamani Dasi presented a brilliant and stirring lecture on
&lsquo;Cultivating Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual Resiliency in
ISKCON Communities&rsquo;. Drawing from her work with families and
her personal process in Krsna consciousness, she explained the
growing field and specialisation of Positive Psychology and the
Resiliency Model. This treatment modality emphasises the strengths
and resources of clients, enlisting their focus in building on
positive aspects of their experience and lives. Challenges and
problems are reframed from a positive perspective and include brief
cognitive therapy. She deftly wove excerpts from Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
books and lectures with positive psychology in order to help
participants to visualise themselves as &lsquo;Victorious Vaisnavas&rsquo;,
successful in their personal struggles to achieve physical, mental,
and spiritual congruence and authenticity in their lives.</p>

<p>Ravindra Svarupa
Dasa presented on Pneumapathologies of ISKCON in the light of Anton
Boisen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Laws of Spiritual Life&rsquo;. He provided a
chart detailing the characteristics and problems associated with
people who undergo neurotic and psychotic symptoms while pursuing
spiritual aspirations and the rigours of religious life. Boisen&rsquo;s
work appears to be similar to current theories in the transpersonal
school of psychology and Stanislav Grof&rsquo;s work on spiritual
emergencies. Ravindra Svarupa Dasa provided historical context for
the applicability of Boisen&rsquo;s theories for ISKCON devotees and
emphasised the intrinsic core crises confronting devotees of all
faiths and religions in their journey towards authenticity.</p>

<p>Finally, it should
be mentioned that the abundant <I>prasadam</I> throughout the
conference was exquisite in its preparation and variety thanks to
ISKCON Potomac cook, Caitanya Nitai Dasa, and the temple president&rsquo;s
wife, Tunga Vidya Dasi.</p>
