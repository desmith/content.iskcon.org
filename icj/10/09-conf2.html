  ISKCON,
Nava Jiyada Nrsimha Ksetra, Germany<br>
</I><a href="99-biodata.html#lkd">Lal Krsna Dasa</a></span></p>
<p>Every year ISKCON Communications Europe
(ICE) holds its Leadership Team (ICELT) meetings. These meetings are
an opportunity for its members to associate with those who share a
mission. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to reflect on their service in the
company of those who share many of the same challenges, to draw on
the experience of others and to share their own experiences. It&rsquo;s
an opportunity to recharge batteries and to discuss challenging
issues in a conservative, devotional atmosphere.</p>
<p>In April this year, twenty-three
devotees joined together at Nava Jiyada Nrsimha Ksetra, in the
Bavarian Forest, for the thirteenth of these annual meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at secularism</strong></p>
<p>A key theme running through this year&rsquo;s
meeting was secularism and its impact upon ISKCON. Merudevi Dasi,
this year&rsquo;s director of ICE, laid the groundwork for
discussions on this topic by leading the group through a history of
secularism in Western Europe since the seventeenth century, when John
Locke asserted that you can&rsquo;t trust a Catholic because he is
ruled by a foreigner and you can&rsquo;t trust an atheist because he
has no moral reference point.</p>
<p>Merudevi outlined some of the current
thinking on secularism, the different types of secular states that
exist, and the principles that underlie their approaches.
Specifically examined were: neutral secularism, where the state is
expressly not religious and does not support religion; positive
secularism, where the state, while not favouring any particular
tradition, does attempt to create an atmosphere favourable to all
religions; and negative secularism where the state, while careful not
to support religion, is careful not to discriminate against or
inhibit valid religious expression.</p>
<p>This led to some probing questions: Are
secular states value-free? Is secularism ideology-free? Is the
secular notion that &lsquo;nothing is right/nothing is wrong&rsquo;
itself a statement of faith?</p>
<p>With some theoretical background
established, the group was taken on a tour of the situation in modern
Europe, particularly the EU (European Union), probably the most vital
force in establishing Europe&rsquo;s identity in the coming century.
The EU and its future members comprise some interesting blocs when it
comes to secularism. At the danger of over-simplifying, we have a
core of states such as France, Germany, and Sweden, all of which are
essentially secularised (although to different degrees of neutral,
positive, and negative secularism). Contrasting with this we have
states that, at least historically, have been firmly non-secular,
such as Italy and Ireland. Into this mix are being invited states
such as Poland that are firmly religious and then there is the
Vatican with its vision of an essentially-Christian Europe.</p>
<p>This is the Europe in which ISKCON
members are preaching. How it develops will profoundly affect ISKCON.
The reality is that Europe is becoming increasingly secularised; God
is no longer perceived as the &lsquo;glue that holds Europe
together&rsquo;. How will ISKCON develop in a secular state? Is it a
help or a hindrance to ISKCON&rsquo;s activities? How do ISKCON and
its members relate to a secular state? And, closer to home, to what
extent does ISKCON secularise itself; that is to say, how does ISKCON
distinguish between &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; and &lsquo;managerial&rsquo;
roles and relationships?</p>
<p>The role of ISKCON Communications in
this Europe was discussed and a need to help redefine and reshape
secularism was identified. It was felt that in order to develop a
truly secular state &mdash; one that allows different values to exist
within it, that doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;banish&rsquo; God &mdash; the
assumption that secularism is entirely neutral needs to be examined.
In Europe. current models of secularism tend to place secular
humanist ideals at the centre of public life while relegating
religion to the periphery. A truly secular state would allow humanism
and religion to exist equally as valid philosophies for those who
choose to follow them. True secularism allows religion to exist in
public, with rights and responsibilities, just as it allows humanism
to exist in public.</p>
<p>These messages could be assimilated
into ICE&rsquo;s ongoing communications with government and advanced
by working with other faith traditions to create a shared vision and
shared influence.</p>
<p><strong>Secularism in practice: Should God be
in the EU Constitution?</strong></p>
<p>Having been grounded in the issues
surrounding secularism it was time for some practical application. At
the time of the meetings, the EU was involved in debate over whether
God should have a place in its Constitution. Krsna-lila Dasi, from
ISKCON Communications Hungary, led a thorough and enlightening
discussion that enabled an informed debate. One of the highlights of
this year&rsquo;s meetings was the skilfulness of the preparation and
presentation of the issues.</p>
<p>The group was invited to look at the
main approaches to the discussion; to analyse the relevant sections
of the draft constitution; to compose an alternative draft; and to
propose a plan of action by which their concerns could be shared.</p>
<p>The first question underlying the
discussion was whether Europe is a Christian or multi-faith
continent. ISKCON&rsquo;s own presence as well as the influx of
people of previously &lsquo;unheard of&rsquo; faiths, and the
millennia long presence of Judaism, Islam, and other traditions in
Europe would seem to provide an obvious answer to that question.</p>
<p>The second question, carrying over from
Merudevi&rsquo;s discussion, was whether Europe is a religious or a
secular continent. This is a very thorny question and one without a
clear answer. However, it soon became clear just how much the answer
affects the perception of Europe&rsquo;s identity, values, and
structure, and thus how much it would affect the debate.</p>
<p>Is European culture based on
Christianity, as the Vatican maintains, or is it based on ancient
Greek and Roman cultures, as well as Judaism, Christianity, Islam,
humanism, and all the other philosophies that have found a home
there?</p>
<p>What of Europe&rsquo;s values? Is the
&lsquo;soul&rsquo; of Europe Christian? Or is it more humanist in
nature? Should Europe&rsquo;s institutions reflect its Christian
heritage or should they reflect a more broadly religious heritage?
Should Europe&rsquo;s institutions mix temporal and sacral values or
should they remain firmly secular?</p>
<p>This was obviously not a discussion in
search of knee-jerk responses. There was much to consider before
looking at the draft Constitution.</p>
<p>The sections of the Constitution
examined were &lsquo;Article 37: Status of churches and
non-confessional organisations&rsquo; (it was interesting to observe
just how much of the argument is couched in Christian terms) and the
preamble to the Constitution. The decision to be made was whether to
put energy into a campaign on this issue, and, if so, which parts to
concentrate on, and, of course, how such a campaign would look.</p>
<p>The discussion was lively and, at
times, passionate. This was where the value of open discussion in a
conservative and protective environment would be revealed. It was a
place where responses needed to be clearly thought through and
explained before being accepted and where the relationship-building
that is so vital a part of these meetings was tested.</p>
<p>The consensus view was that, although
it may have been a little late in the day, it was worth the effort to
use this issue as an opportunity to build relationships across faiths
by presenting a rational argument for change; change that would
include God in a way that was neither sectarian nor heavy-handed. It
was felt that the real changes needed to be made to Article 37 rather
than the preamble.</p>
<p>The next step in the meetings was to
formulate a few guiding principles for any redraft. These included
the need to reflect the reality that most people are religious and
would like to see God in the constitution; that terminology should be
acceptable to all faiths as well as to atheists and humanists; and,
that if Europe seeks unity, it needs to be inclusive of those of all
faiths (and none). These principles led the group to suggest only
slight modifications to the draft of the relevant parts of the
Constitution; for example, it was suggested that the title of Section
37, &lsquo;Status of churches and non-confessional organisations&rsquo;,
be replaced with something more inclusive such as &lsquo;Status of
religious, philosophical, and ethical organisations&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Pragmatism or principle</strong></p>
<p>Pragmatism or principle: Does ISKCON
favour models that will best allow it to <I>advance </I>its aims or
does it favour models that will most closely <I>reflect </I>its aims?</p>
<p>To what extent are ISKCON policy
decisions based on principle? This was the question that emerged from
Anuttama Dasa&rsquo;s presentation. Anuttama, the GBC (Governing Body
Commissioner) for ISKCON Communications, tested the group&rsquo;s
adherence to principles by turning the tables on the discussion. Till
now the discussion had been about how Europe, a continent in which
ISKCON still faces difficulties, should develop. Anuttama took the
models that were favoured for Europe and transposed them to India, a
country where ISKCON has traditionally been very well received.</p>
<p>Would the group recommend the same
approach to secularism in India as it did for Europe? Should ISKCON
develop a principled stand on an issue and stand by it, or should it
adjust according to practical considerations? If it is a bit of both,
then how is the balance to be decided? To what extent is the Society
ruled by pragmatism, and to what extent is it ruled by principle?</p>
<p>This led to a discussion of the
principles that ISKCON clearly should value in its attempts to
cultivate a God-centred society: the type of characteristics that
need to be developed as a society and individually if people are to
be attracted to Prabhupada&rsquo;s ISKCON. There was also discussion
of the obstacles and opportunities faced in expanding ISKCON&rsquo;s
mission.</p>
<p><strong>Present and future direction</strong></p>
<p>Towards the end of the meetings,
Saunaka &not;si Dasa, stepping aside as ICE director, and Anuttama
Dasa did what they do so well: they gave their personal vision and
direction.</p>
<p>They stressed the need for ICE to
broaden the circle, share its experience, and train more people to
participate. The ICELT model of simultaneous building of
relationships and consensus can be expanded, if prot&eacute;g&eacute;s
are established and trained. One of the best ways to achieve this
kind of growth is to continue to expand the teaching of the ISKCON
Communications course that Anuttama and Hanuman Dasa have so
successfully carried to six continents.</p>
<p>As well as internal growth, they
expressed the need for ICE members to become more deeply involved in
outreach programmes: get involved in interfaith dialogue now or be
left behind; form or join local Hindu organisations; form, or be
instrumental in the formation of, a Europe-wide Hindu organisation.</p>
<p>Saunaka&rsquo;s main messages on his
retirement as director were the need to maintain a reflective <I>sanga</I>
(spiritual gathering); to be proactive; to maintain an educational
ethos in ICE; and to regard preaching as an occupation, or, at the
very least, a major commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>As is appropriate for a group of
aspiring preachers, the meetings went beyond the cares of the world
and into the cares of the soul. Over the last few years more and more
time has been spent on developing the participants&rsquo;
introspective natures at these meetings.</p>
<p>This year, most of these reflective
sessions were led by Hanuman Dasa (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Spain)
and Yadunandana Dasa (Principal of the Bhaktivedanta College in
Radhadesh, Belgium). Interspersed between discussions of secularism
and other concerns, were opportunities to examine, as a group and
individually, topics such as what makes us happy? Where are we now?
Where do we want to be in ten years and how do we get from here to
there? The depth of the meditation and discovery in these sessions
alone brings some devotees to these meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Flavour</strong></p>
<p>Each
year&rsquo;s meetings carry their own flavour; some sweet, some
serious. This year the atmosphere was very jolly. This was helped
greatly by the care received from the dedicated Vaisnavas that hosted
us at Nrsimha Ksetra. Due to their gracious hospitality we could be
carefree, even when absorbed in the intricacies of constitutional
language.</p>
