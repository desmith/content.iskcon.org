<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sesa
    Dasa, a member of ISKCON&rsquo;s Ministry for Educational
    Development, looks at the place of &lsquo;virtue&rsquo; in the lives
    of devotees. He notes the changes that thirty years of devotional
    practice have made to his outlook on life and takes lessons from Mahabharata about the apparent conflict between material and
    spiritual duty.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirty years is time
enough. Thirty years, out of a life of fifty-one, spent in the Hare
Krsna movement, is certainly time enough. A thirty-year period
provides enough life experience to enable one to reflect on what one
has or hasn&rsquo;t accomplished. It&rsquo;s enough time for one to
draw conclusions, while leaving enough time to make necessary changes
based on those conclusions.</p>

<p>Yet, it is often the
case that a single event does more to shape one&rsquo;s conclusions
about life than the passage of time alone. Our individual histories,
as well as the histories of civilisations, often turn on a single,
dramatic event. Looking back over the last thirty years, 9/11 clearly
stands out as a turning point in my life as a Hare Krsna
devotee.</p>
<p>The thirty-year
period in which I have been a devotee can be neatly framed by
dramatic world affairs. At one end is the Vietnam War, a transforming
event especially meaningful to my generation. On the other end are
the events of 11 September 2001.</p>
<p><strong>From &lsquo;Army Brat&rsquo; to Hare
Krsna</strong></p>

<p>I joined the Hare
Krsna
movement in the summer of 1973, during the Vietnam War, at the end of
a two-year search for self-identity. I was raised as what is
colloquially known as an &lsquo;Army Brat&rsquo;, the son of a United
States Army Officer. Life as the son of an officer bred in me
discipline and acceptance of an established order. The &lsquo;brat&rsquo;
part had to do with an arrogance grown out of our being different or
special in relation to our contemporaries. A type of elitism borrowed
from the strength of the army that could be summarised in the
childish sayings: &lsquo;My father (the army) can beat up your father
(the civilian)&rsquo;, &lsquo;I (the United States) am right, you
(the enemy) are wrong&rsquo;. Fully embracing this culture and my
role in it, I entered the United States Military Academy at West
Point upon graduating from high school in 1969. During an interview
that was part of the admission process I was asked whether I had any
hesitation about the occupation of a professional soldier, whether I
was worried about the dangers of war. In response I said, &lsquo;No.
There are hazards in all occupations. Whatever dangers may be there,
I accept in the line of duty&rsquo;. From the look on the
interviewing officer&rsquo;s face I knew I was in.</p>

<p>As strange as it may
seem, two years later I found myself in the middle of an identity
crisis. I had never really thought about the world independent of the
context of my life in the army. Neither had I thought much about how
my future profession might affect other peoples and their culture.
However, college life, even within the tightly regimented confines of
West Point, began to broaden my horizons. Disappointing my father and
officers at West Point, I resigned from the academy in the summer of
1971 leaving behind an identity that had been my entire life.</p>

<p>My search for
self-identity first led me to political movements. I recall hanging a
poster in my room which depicted African, Asian, and Latino labourers
standing defiantly with their tools under a banner which cried out,
&lsquo;Workers of the World Unite&rsquo;.</p>

<p>After this brief
pendulum swing from the conservative military establishment to the
political far left, my search sprang off in another direction, this
time to alternative spirituality. My mother&rsquo;s response typified
the bewildered responses to my actions at the time. She said: &lsquo;We
can understand you want to be religious, but why not just be a
[Christian] minister; why something so foreign?&rsquo;</p>

<p>In July 1973 I met
the Hare Krsna
devotees in a park in Albany, New York, and have been with the
movement since that time. Looking back over the thirty years since I
made the decision to become a Hare Krsna
devotee I now see some surprising elements of that decision that were
not recognisable to me at the time: becoming a devotee wasn&rsquo;t
as foreign as I thought.</p>

<p>Certainly my outer
appearance had suddenly become foreign, and there is no doubt that at
that time I thought, &lsquo;the more radical, the better&rsquo;. But
I now realise that my ability to make and sustain such a radical
change was based on underlying virtues with which I had already
established a level of comfort.</p>

<p>The self-discipline,
integrity, self-sacrifice, and loyalty which are enshrined in the
West Point motto, &lsquo;Duty, Honor, Country&rsquo;, were the
virtues that would sustain me as a Hare Krsna devotee. I felt
comfortable as a Hare Krsna devotee because I could easily rewrite
the West Point motto to read: &lsquo;Loyalty and Service to Srila
Prabhupada, ISKCON, and the Vaisnavas&rsquo;.</p>

<p>These virtues also
helped carry me through my Hare Krsna mid-life crisis. After
graduating from law school in 1991 I was forty years old, no longer
supported by the temple, married with one child, and had neither a
job nor an employment history to call on. As I reflected on my life
at that time, I again turned to the virtues that had previously
sustained me in times of change. I recorded these virtues in a
document I wrote at that time entitled &lsquo;Our Family Goals&rsquo;.</p>

<p><B>Our family goals</B></p>

<p><em>Our principle:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To serve Srila
    Prabhupada and the Vaisnavas: <I>chadiya
      vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba </I>(without being a devotee of a
    devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement, Narottama
    Dasa &micro;hakura)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our methods of
service:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To serve the mission
    of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (ISKCON)</li>
  <li>To
    share our good fortune with others</li>
  <li>To set a good
    example as individuals and as a family</li>
  <li>To extend ourselves
    to help others with whatever qualifications or facilities Lord Krsna
    has bestowed upon us</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our
faith and motivation to act:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding that
    by serving the Vaisnavas
    in these ways we will obtain all perfections spiritual and material</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on my
life since writing these goals confirms to me that service,
integrity, charity, and faith not only provided a basis for my
spiritual well-being, but also for my material well-being.</p>

<p><B>A response to
9/11 &mdash; virtue</B></p>

<p>While the events of
11 September 2001 form an end frame of a thirty-year period as a Hare
Krsna
devotee, those events pose new challenges as I look forward, making
plans for the future based on my past experiences.</p>

<p>Pat Buchanan, the
conservative Christian politician who has run for President of the
United States on numerous occasions, has issued his response to the
events of 11 September. In his book, <I>The Death of the West</I>, Mr
Buchanan laments over what he determines to be the decline of Western
Civilisation. In a review of this book published by the American
Immigration Law Foundation, the reviewer concludes, &lsquo;Somewhere
along the line, Buchanan came to embrace the notion that if a person
is not white, not Christian, and not possessing a European or
American heritage, then that person is automatically deeply hostile
to the religions, traditions, and morality of the West&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The United States
Government has also issued their response. In a speech given to the
National Newspaper Association on 21 March 2002, Marc Grossman, the
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since the end of the
    Cold War, we have been searching for a way to understand the world in
    which we live. Think of the name we gave the period: &lsquo;The Post
    Cold-War Era&rsquo;. We described our environment not for what it
    was, but for what it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>The attacks of
    September 11 may have marked the end of the &lsquo;Post Cold-War
    Era.&rsquo; Last November, while I was at the UN General Assembly in
    New York, I went to Ground Zero. As I stared at the mass of twisted
    metal and rubble that entombed nearly three thousand people, I knew
    that the period of uncertainty had ended. We have our new Berlin
    Wall. We have a purpose. As President Bush said last week on the
    six-month anniversary of the attacks, &lsquo;Every nation should know
    that, for America, the war on terror is not just a policy, it&rsquo;s
    a pledge.&rsquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Certainly Mr.
  Buchanan has the right to express his opinions. Certainly it is the
  duty of the US Government to create policies to protect its citizens,
  and all peoples, from the intentional harm others would perpetrate.
  One may agree or disagree with these sweeping social and political
  responses, but from my perspective both responses lacked something.
  They lacked what for me has become a defining element of life: the
  need to become a better person. Indeed, for me the combination of
  these two responses is an eerie throwback to the Army Brat tradition
  and culture of my upbringing. 9/11 demands more of me as a Hare Krsna
  devotee.  </p>
<p>Based on the responses to 9/11
articulated by Mr Buchanan, the US Government, and others it is clear
that the post 9/11 world will be a more guarded era, but also an era
that at least recognises, if not accepts, cultural and religious
differences. It will be an era where differences are questioned
first, and accepted second. As Hare Krsna
devotees we are different first. While in the first instance this may
put a burden upon us to make ourselves recognisable to others, in the
second instance it provides us with an opportunity to make an impact
with our spiritual message.</p>

<p>I stated earlier
that I experienced a certain level of comfort when I became a
devotee. A comfort based on the similarity of the underlying virtues
of my previous environment and the spiritual environment of the Hare
Krsna
movement. While those similarities certainly exist, I believe there
is certainly more to be gained through the spiritual practices of the
Hare Krsna
movement, particularly by chanting Hare Krsna.
As a result of these spiritual practices, I feel myself to be a
better person than I was before I became a Hare Krsna
devotee. I feel more capable of understanding the effect of my
actions on different peoples and their cultures and I feel better
able to respond to their material and spiritual needs.</p>

<p>I would propose
that, as Hare Krsna
devotees, we can meet the burden placed upon us by 9/11, and enhance
the effectiveness of our spiritual message through the practice of
virtue in our various services and walks of life.</p>

<p>In his book,
<I>Vai</I><I>s</I><I>nava
Compassion</I>, my friend Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami provides a personal
story to illustrate how the simple practice of virtue will make us
more recognisable to others:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To show how
    important kindness is when dealing with the public, I would like to
    tell a story of something that happened to me. One time, I was
    getting off a plane after a long flight. I was in the back, but I was
    walking fast, trying to get ahead or the people in front of us so I
    wouldn&rsquo;t have to stand in a long line at customs. To get ahead
    of them, I had to push my way through the crowd and push myself
    forward at their expense. Then a woman turned to me and said, in a
    sarcastic tone, &lsquo;Is it against your religion to be polite?&rsquo;
    I felt terrible when she said that, and I also became conscious that
    when we are dressed as devotees and behaving badly, people seem to
    link our behavior with our religion. As religionists, we should have
    seen that other people were also suffering from the long flight and
    the long disembarkation lines. St. Francis kissed lepers. We are
    asked only to be kind and considerate in our dealings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kindness is a virtue
recognisable in all cultures of the world. Political stances, and
even religious stances, no matter how carefully crafted, inevitably
draw lines between people. Virtue has a unifying, sustaining effect.
In most instances of dealing with the public, our practice of virtue
is how the Hare Krsna
devotees will be recognisable as better people.</p>

<p>Acting with virtue
is very much the tradition of the Hare Krsna
movement. The Sanskrit term <I>dharma</I> is one way in which virtue
may be translated. In the context of our tradition, <I>dharma</I> can
be understood to encompass the broad set of ethical, moral, and
spiritual behaviours that formed the basis of Vedic culture. In the
context of the Hare Krsna
movement, <I>dharma </I>can be understood to provide a unifying,
sustaining basis for our social interaction, within the society of
devotees and society at large, in three important ways.</p>

<p>First, individually,
when Western devotees come to the Hare Krsna
movement seeking spiritual life, they often reject the culture they
come from along with the ethical and moral values of that culture.
The problem with this approach to Krsna
consciousness is that, because these devotees have not yet fully
understood and assimilated Vedic culture, many find themselves caught
between two worlds. Having lost their cultural moorings, devotees
sometimes find that what was once a simple decision, things like what
is right or wrong, can now become quite complex. Such dilemmas often
lead to acts or attitudes that the common man finds difficult to
reconcile with religious or even good behaviour. Understanding and
acting with Krsna
conscious virtues will help resolve these dilemmas.</p>

<p>Second,
organisationally, the Hare Krsna
movement is a very diverse society. People from virtually every race,
creed, nationality, and socio-economic background, have come together
in one society with the purposes of becoming Krsna conscious and
giving Krsna consciousness to others. We are aware of the emphasis
Srila Prabhupada placed on cooperation and how difficult he knew that
would be for us. Without a common set of ethical and moral values
there are bound to be difficulties along the path to achieving the
purposes and goals of the society.</p>

<p>Third, to advance in
Krsna
consciousness, consistency is absolutely necessary. By providing a
consistent basis or platform for action, virtues can assist the
aspiring devotee much as the regulative principles given by Srila
Prabhupada provide guidance in our daily spiritual practices.</p>

<p>Let me give an
example of how the problems we encounter in the Hare Krsna movement
tend to spiral out of control when there is a lack of established
ethical and moral values. It is an example of failure, but one of the
most familiar virtuous maxims Srila Prabhupada gave us was &lsquo;to
make failure the pillar of success&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Some time ago I was
involved in implementing a management decision at an ISKCON temple.
Virtually all the devotees in the temple agreed that some changes
needed to be made, but naturally there were different opinions about
exactly what should be done. Poor communication between the devotees,
based on a lack of consideration for one another, led to the
development of different factions. These factions, drawn along racial
lines, used tactics such as behind doors political moves, threats to
report foreigners to the government, and threats of physical
violence, to apply pressure for a solution acceptable to their group.</p>

<p>The situation did
eventually work out, but what we had to go through was certainly both
undesirable and unnecessary. I am not suggesting that we should be
overly idealistic, problems will always be there, but we are better
people than we showed in this instance. Having an established set of
shared ethical and moral values will prevent things from degenerating
as they did in this situation and facilitate a change in our approach
to problem solving.</p>
<p>The scriptures of
the Hare Krsna
movement emphasise virtue. Virtue is not a matter of speculation,
emotion, or new age philosophy. Virtues are the practical application
of knowledge. In <I>Bhagavad-gita</I> (13.8&ndash;12) Lord Krsna,
describing a person in knowledge, presents what could be seen as a
set of ethical and moral values:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Humility;
    pridelessness; nonviolence; tolerance; simplicity; approaching a bona
    fide spiritual master; cleanliness; steadiness; self-control;
    renunciation of the objects of sense gratification; absence of false
    ego; the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease;
    detachment; freedom from entanglement with children, wife, home and
    the rest; even-mindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events;
    constant and unalloyed devotion to Me; aspiring to live in a solitary
    place; detachment from the general mass of people; accepting the
    importance of self-realisation; and philosophical search for the
    Absolute Truth &mdash; all these I declare to be knowledge, and
    besides this whatever there may be is ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The twenty-six
qualities of a devotee (below) are even more specific to the practice
of virtue for Hare Krsna
devotees. When Lord Caitanya was instructing Sanatana Goswami he
said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Devotees are always
    merciful, humble, truthful, equal to all, faultless, magnanimous,
    mild and clean. They are without material possessions, and they
    perform welfare work for everyone. They are peaceful, surrendered to
    Krsna and desireless. They are indifferent to material acquisitions
    and are fixed in devotional service. They completely control the six
    bad qualities &mdash; lust, anger, greed and so forth. They eat only
    as much as required, and they are not inebriated. They are
    respectful, grave, compassionate and without false prestige. They are
    friendly, poetic, expert and silent. (<I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta,
      Madhya-lila,</I> 22.78&ndash;80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things are
required for the practice of virtue, <I>jnana</I> and <I>vijnana</I>,
knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge. These
verses from <I>Bhagavad-gita </I>and <I>Sri Caitanya-caritamrta</I>
provide the knowledge: it is up to us as individuals to apply the
knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>A lesson from Mahabharata</strong></p>

<p>There is a very
interesting story from <I>Mahabharata </I>that illustrates the
practice of virtue. Although the story is set in ancient times, its
lessons are adaptable to the modern world and our lives as Hare Krsna
devotees. Applying the lessons learned here will, to a very large
extent, determine how effectively our spiritual message is received
in the modern world.</p>

<p><em>There was once a
young brahmana named Kausika,
who was the only son of his old parents. He had a strong desire to
advance on the spiritual path by studying the Vedas, but he felt
himself tied down by serving his old parents. One day he decided that
he had had enough. He was going to the forest to devote himself to
the study of the Vedas. His old parents tried to reason with him:
they were dependent upon him, if he left who would look after their
needs? They pleaded that he not forsake them. Nevertheless, Kausika
left for the forest.</em></p>

<p>This is a story
about duty and virtue. As long as we are living in the material world
there will be a tension between spiritual duties and material duties.
Kausika
had material duties: his service to his father and mother. These
duties could be described as expectations of behaviour that Kausika
was obliged to follow. That was the tradition, the culture. Although
exceptions always exist, one is generally expected to follow cultural
norms, as such norms bring order to society. This is not only true
for the Vedic culture of the past; we can see that modern culture
also has its norms of behaviour.</p>

<p>Hare Krsna
devotees are also faced with the tension between spiritual and
material obligations. As this story develops we shall see the &lsquo;how,
when, and why&rsquo; associated with acting outside cultural norms,
and how understanding our spiritual duty with respect to other
members of our culture is essential for one on the path of
transcendence.</p>
<p><em>In the forest,
Kausika
practiced austerities, did penance, and studied the Vedas. As the
seasons came and went, he acquired great power. One day, as he was
reciting the Vedas while seated beneath a tree, a female crane flew
up, perched herself on a branch above Kausika,
and passed stool on his head. At this, Kausika
became very angry, and, with a desire to retaliate, he looked up at
the crane with eyes that were red with rage. Immediately, the crane
fell down dead. Seeing the result of his anger, Kausika
became very sorry. With great remorse he lamented: &lsquo;O how could
I have allowed my anger to get the better of me?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Patience: patience
is the opposite of anger. In the verses from <I>Bhagavad-gita </I>quoted
earlier we find the virtue of patience described as &lsquo;even-mindedness
amid pleasant and unpleasant events&rsquo;. In his purport, Srila
Prabhupada explains a very important point about genuine practice of
spiritual life. He says: &lsquo;Generally, when we get something
desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we
are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position
these things will not agitate us&rsquo;. (<I>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I>,
13.8&ndash;12 purport) The nature of this world is that both good and
bad things will happen to us. The proof of our spiritual advancement
will not be that good and bad things don&rsquo;t happen, but that we
react to these events properly. Lord Krsna advises that we react with
virtue.</p>

<p>Two things can be
learned from Kausika&rsquo;s
reaction to the crane&rsquo;s passing stool on him. First, perhaps he
wasn&rsquo;t as spiritually advanced as he thought. Genuine spiritual
advancement will have an impact on how we either remain bound to or
freed from material duties. So what do we do, how do we act while
awaiting spiritual advancement? The <I>varnasrama</I> system (the
system of stages of life and occupational duties) recommends
virtuously performing our material duties. This is a form of patience
in the practice of spiritual life.</p>

<p>Second, as Hare
Krsna devotees we need to understand that our interaction with the
material world is meant to provide us with needed instruction. In his
essay, <I>The Bhagavata: Its Philosophy, Ethics, and Theology </I>(p.
21), Srila Bhaktivinoda &micro;hakura explains that the phenomenal
appearance of nature is meant to explain the spiritual nature. The
experiences we gain, good or bad, in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo;,
the world of material duties, are not idle doings. They are meant for
our instruction.</p>

<p><em>Some time
thereafter, Kausika
went to a nearby village to beg for alms. While going door to door,
he came to a certain house, and, as usual, he asked the housewife to
give him something in charity. The lady of the house replied: &lsquo;O
brahmana, just wait a
little&rsquo;, and went back inside. As the woman was cleaning the
bowl that was used for giving alms, her husband arrived, very tired
and hungry. Because of this, she forgot the brahmana
and quickly went to tend to her husband&rsquo;s needs.</em></p>

<p>Prudence: prudence
is cautious practical wisdom. Here the housewife is presented with
conflicting duties. Who should she serve first, the <I>brahmana </I>or
her husband? Prudence was her shelter for she had the practical
wisdom to establish priorities in her behaviour.</p>

<p>Chastity: chastity
is an example of prudence. Individuals are chaste to each other when
they have decided to make a commitment to each other, a commitment
that has priority over the pushing and pulling of the material
nature.</p>

<p>Chastity in marriage
is based on an exchange. This is the important thing about chastity,
that there is an exchange of mutual respect. There may be cultural
differences in how that relationship is expressed. It is not that
Western devotees should be expected to indiscriminately adopt all
aspects of the model of chastity found in cultures other than their
own, and vice versa. Different cultures may place priority on
different aspects of a relationship, but all cultures emphasise the
exchange needed to make marriage a relationship.</p>

<p>It is no secret that
Srila Prabhupada was disappointed with how his disciples practiced
the <I>grhastha asrama</I> (household life). Nor is it a secret that
women in ISKCON have not always been given the respect they deserve.
As a result, today we find our families weak. As Hare Krsna devotees
we sometimes like to think of ourselves as better than the
non-devotees. Are we able to demonstrate this supposed superiority? I
think it is fair to say that in relation to our family structure,
inasmuch as family structure represents a practical example of
virtuous life, we cannot demonstrate superiority.</p>

<p>Therefore, it would
be prudent of us, the Hare Krsna
devotees, to make resolving our family problems a priority. Putting
some emphasis here may seem like surrender to material life, but such
an emphasis is an opportunity to influence others by providing an
example of how our spiritual teachings can be practically applied.</p>

<p> <I>Then, the woman
suddenly remembered that she had asked the </I>brahmana<I>, Kausika,
to wait. Feeling ashamed of her negligence, she quickly took some
alms and came before him. Kausika was very angry by this time. He
fumed: &lsquo;I am very surprised that you would dare to make me wait
like this!&rsquo; </I></p>

<p><em>The woman tried to
pacify Kausika by explaining: &lsquo;O brahmana,
my husband is my lord, and therefore I always serve him first&rsquo;.</em></p>

<p><I>Kausika
challenged: &lsquo;Foolish woman, do you really think that your
husband is more worthy of respect than </I>brahmanas<I>, before whom
even Indra bows down his head? Don&rsquo;t you know that a </I>brahmana&rsquo;s<I>
wrath can destroy the entire Earth?&rsquo;</I></p>

<p><I>At this the woman
exclaimed: &lsquo;O </I>rsi<I>,
I am no she-crane. Therefore you had better give up your anger, for
it will never be able to harm me. I know how you had killed a
she-crane with your angry glance&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p><I>Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
was surprised to hear that she knew about the she-crane.</I></p>

<p><I>The woman
continued: &lsquo;You should know that one is really a </I>brahmana
<I>when he has conquered his lust and anger, and is therefore
forgiving. O holy one, you are learned, but you have not understood
the truth about virtue. If you wish to be enlightened on the subject,
you should look for Dharmavyadha, who resides in Mithila&rsquo;. </I></p>

<p><I>After hearing the
woman&rsquo;s remarkable speech, the </I>brahmana<I> humbly said:
&lsquo;Your words of wisdom have given me great pleasure, and my
anger has subsided. I honestly feel that your chastisement was meant
for my benefit. I will go to Mithila, as you have suggested, so that
I can learn the true meaning of virtue&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p>Humility: humility
is the first item of knowledge mentioned by Lord Krsna in the verse
from <I>Bhagavad-gita </I>I quoted earlier. Kausika was both
mystified and humbled by the fact that the woman knew of how he
killed the she-crane. Although the woman&rsquo;s strong words were
humiliating, they opened the door to receiving the knowledge Kausika
needed. Material duties often put us in Kausika&rsquo;s
position, humiliated, but how often do we stop to inquire into the
purpose of, or the benefit to be gained by, such humiliation?</p>

<p>Forgiveness: In his
purport to <I>Srimad-Bhagavatam </I>4.6.48, Srila Prabhupada gives us
another of the maxims of virtue he would often repeat. He writes: &lsquo;It
is said that the beauty of a <I>tapasvi</I>, or saintly person, is
forgiveness&rsquo;. A saintly person undergoes penance to free
himself of lust and anger. Lust and anger are the result of
self-absorption, whereas forgiveness is focused on turning to others.
As we have been taught by Srila Prabhupada, the business of a saintly
person is to benefit others.</p>

<p>Kausika had the
<I>jnana</I>, knowledge, but he did not yet understand <I>vijnana</I>,
the practical application of that knowledge, especially how his
knowledge should benefit others. He could not easily forgive.
Therefore, the woman sent him to Dharmavyadha to learn about virtue.</p>

<p>At this point in the
story it is clear that Kausika is afflicted with a syndrome common to
many Hare Krsna devotees today, premature transcendence. But the
depth of Kausika&rsquo;s misunderstanding of spiritual life will not
be completely revealed until he meets Dharmavyadha.</p>

<p><I>As he travelled
to Mithila, Kausika was thinking: &lsquo;This Dharmavyadha must be a
great ascetic&rsquo;. When he arrived he immediately made inquiries
from the local </I>brahmanas <I>as to the whereabouts of
Dharmavyadha. </I></p>

<p>&lsquo;<I>You will
find him in that shop over there,&rsquo; he was told. </I></p>

<p><I>As he walked
toward the shop Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
pondered: &lsquo;What would the ascetic be doing in a shop?&rsquo;
Arriving at the shop Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
was stunned, it was a butcher&rsquo;s shop!</I></p>

<p><I>Because of the
crowd, Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
stood at some distance. However, understanding Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika&rsquo;s
arrival, the butcher Dharmavyadha quickly got up from his seat and
went to the secluded place where Kausika was standing.</I></p>

<p><I>Dharmavyadha
said: &lsquo;O </I>brahmana<I>, I know about how the chaste woman
spoke to you, and why you have come here&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p><I>Kausika was
surprised, but gathered himself and said: &lsquo;Such a sinful
profession does not befit you. You must be ashamed of it&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p>Integrity: integrity
implies a condition of being whole or undivided; a completeness in
steadfast adherence to a moral or ethical code. Kausika
had misconceptions about what it means to lead a spiritual life,
misconceptions that resulted in a divisive &lsquo;us and them&rsquo;
mentality.</p>

<p>Premature
transcendence tends to make us look with disdain upon honest working
people, assuming that they haven&rsquo;t got the intelligence to
figure out how they are being exploited by the bosses or their
uncontrolled senses. Being &lsquo;above&rsquo; such occupations,
devotees think it is bad to work for non-devotees, and quote Srila
Prabhupada to prove that <I>brahmanas </I>don&rsquo;t serve others.</p>

<p>The problem with
premature transcendence is that it lacks integrity. Although one
doesn&rsquo;t want to work within the world of material duties,
neither is one actually prepared to live the life of a true ascetic.
This often results in devotees&rsquo; work having more in common with
outlaws (those who also seek to avoid material duties but without
spirituality as their motivation) than honest working people.</p>

<p>In the verse I
quoted from <I>Bhagavad-gita,</I> Lord Krsna
uses the word <I>arjavam, </I>simplicity. In his purport Srila
Prabhupada writes: &lsquo;Simplicity means that without diplomacy one
should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even
to an enemy.&rsquo; Later in <I>Bhagavad-gita</I>, (18.42) when
describing the qualities by which a <I>brahmana </I>works, Lord Krsna
uses the same word. There the word <I>arjavam </I>is translated as
&lsquo;honesty&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Integrity implies a
commitment of honesty to oneself, as a practitioner of spiritual
duties, as well as to others who may still be engaged in material
duties.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<I>I am not
ashamed,&rsquo; replied the butcher. &lsquo;My dear </I>brahmana<I>,
this has been my family occupation for many generations, and thus I
am simply performing the duty that has been ordained for me by the
Supreme Lord. Because this is my destiny, I know that there is
nothing for me to lament about. In spite of my lowly profession, I
always serve my superiors, I always speak the truth, I only eat what
is left over after offering all my food to God, my dependents, and
guests, and I am never envious of others. O </I>brahmana<I>, even if
one is engaged in an abominable profession, he can still develop all
good qualities. One whose heart is naturally inclined toward
truthfulness, charity, and non-violence, is actually a virtuous
person. </I></p>

<p>&lsquo;<I>Every
occupation involves some kind of violence and sinful activity. Would
you not say that farming is an honourable profession? But doesn&rsquo;t
the farmer destroy numerous creatures living in the soil when he
ploughs the field? It is a fact that one is forced to accept so many
conditions as a result of his past karma. Thus, a person must learn
to tolerate all these conditions while trying to lead a virtuous
life.</I></p>

<p>&lsquo;<I>The
ultimate goal of virtue and study of the Vedas is to factually detach
oneself from this materialistic life of personal and extended sense
gratification. This is not only the goal of life for those who have
been born in </I>brahmana<I> families. Even if one is born in a </I>sudra
<I>(labourer) family, but somehow cultivates the mode of goodness,
and thus develops virtuous qualities, he must be accepted as a
genuine </I>brahmana<I>.&rsquo;</I></p>
<p>Sacrifice: One may
ask, &lsquo;Of what concern are material duties to a Hare Krsna
devotee?&rsquo; In his book, <I>Vaisnava Compassion</I>,<I>
</I>Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami offers this reply: &lsquo;Prabhupada
taught us that a devotee should set an example of &ldquo;working in
devotion&rdquo; and offering the results to Krsna&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Sacrifice is
required to achieve anything in this material world. As Hare Krsna
devotees we are often more aware of sacrifice as it relates to our
spiritual duties, but even in the performance of material duties,
sacrifice is essential.</p>

<p>Satsvarupa Dasa
Goswami continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Lord Krsna states
    in <I>Bhagavad-gita</I>, Chapter 3, Text 26, &lsquo;So as not to
    disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of
    prescribed duties, a learned person should not induce them to stop
    work. Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage
    them in all sorts of activities [for the gradual development of Krsna
    consciousness].&rsquo;</p>
  <p>In his purport,
    Srila Prabhupada states: &lsquo;... a realised soul in Krsna
    consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or
    understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all
    work can be dedicated to the service of Krsna.
    The learned Krsna
    conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant persons
    working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to
    behave.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sacrifice of
Hare Krsna
devotees is never meant to be selfish, nor is it meant for achieving
material goals. This is clearly explained in the butcher&rsquo;s
philosophical discourse. Dharmavyadha advises us to carefully
consider the fact that performance of our duties, even our material
duties, is no bar to acting virtuously. And, that such duties are
ultimately meant for a higher purpose. This is confirmed by the
principals of <I>daivi-varnasrama </I>(divine <I>varnasrama, </I>as
opposed to the materialistic system), which tell us that by acting
virtuously within our material duties we can attain the goal of life.</p>

<p><I>The butcher then
requested: &lsquo;My dear </I>brahmana<I>, please enter my house now,
so that you can see for yourself my sole claim to virtue &mdash; my
old mother and father. I worship my mother and father just as one is
supposed to worship the thirty-three principal demigods. My whole
life is dedicated to their service, and I always do exactly that
which is most agreeable to them, and I wash their feet with my own
hands&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p><I>Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
was very astonished to see Dharmavyadha&rsquo;s piety, and so he
praised him highly as being the perfectly virtuous person. </I></p>

<p><I>Then Dharmavyadha
said: &lsquo;My dear </I>brahmana<I>, you have run away from your
responsibilities and have wronged your mother and father by leaving
home without their permission, for the purpose of studying the Vedas.
Now they are very old and invalid and blind as well, and in your
absence they have become very aggrieved. Therefore, you should return
home and console them. Indeed, because of this single fault, all of
your religious practices have been rendered useless&rsquo;.</I></p>

<p><I>Kau</I><I>s</I><I>ika
then circumambulated Dharmavyadha while praising him highly. Then,
after receiving Dharmavyadha&rsquo;s permission, Kausika returned to
his aged parents, and as advised by Dharmavyadha, he became very
attentive in the matter of serving them until the end of their days.</I></p>

<p>The butcher&rsquo;s
philosophical discourse was to convince Kausika with <I>jnana</I>. By
showing how he practiced virtue in caring for his parents, the
butcher was demonstrating <I>vijnana</I>, the practical application
of his knowledge. Kausika had not previously understood the
importance of <I>vijnana</I>, and thus thanked Dharmavyadha for
enlightening him and returned home to resume his duties to his
parents.</p>
<p>As we look forward and plan how to
preach and live Krsna consciousness in the modern
world, I would hope that these virtues &mdash; patience, prudence,
chastity, forgiveness, humility, integrity, and sacrifice &mdash;
will help forge a work ethic for Hare Krsna devotees: an ethic
applicable to our material and spiritual duties. </p>
