            </blockquote>
            <p>An understanding of
              God&rsquo;s relationship with the world is essential for an informed
              response to contemporary scientific worldviews. Although there is
              copious literature dealing with this subject by Christian
              theologians, very little has been done from a Hindu perspective, with
              its different metaphysics. </p>
            <p>We will look at how
Christian thinkers have dealt with the subject of non-physical
influence and intervention in the world, and then what Hinduism has
to offer the discussion. I hope to show that the theistic Sankhya of
the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I> (<I>Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>) offers a rich
metaphysics and conception of the self to enhance two divergent
Christian theologies of nature.</p>
<p>According to the
<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> there is no reason to believe that God
intervenes in the mechanics of nature or has not created a closed
system, wherein objects and events are produced by causes within
nature alone. Moreover, with the introduction of the <I>Bhagavata
Purana</I>&rsquo;s metaphysics, the Western &lsquo;natural/supernatural&rsquo;
distinction must break down.</p>
<p><B>What has become
of the scientific method</B></p>
<p>Upon reading a typical university-level
biology or physics textbook, one striking feature is that one will
not find reference to non-physical phenomena, such as mind,
intelligence, consciousness, God, overriding purposes, or final
causes. One function of science is to describe phenomena; the
physical eye does not see non-physical phenomena, so science is
silent regarding them. But science does more than just describe, it
also attempts to explain what is seen in terms of natural laws,
forces, and chance mechanisms &mdash; what we ordinarily call
&lsquo;theories&rsquo;. &lsquo;Naturalism&rsquo; means that
scientific theories are constrained to natural laws, mechanisms,
forces, and other physical events; they do not speak of miracles,
divine interventions, the influence of minds, intelligences, God, or
gods. Nature is assumed to be a self-sufficient, closed system that
operates, transforms itself, and produces objects and events by the
principles contained within itself. It is assumed that the laws and
forces within nature can account for observed phenomena.</p>
<p>'Methodological
naturalism' is the method employed by scientists in what is now known
as &lsquo;science&rsquo;. As scientists study nature, they assume it
is an unbroken chain of natural cause and effect; that all phenomena
are explicable by natural laws and forces produced within nature.
Naturalism as a method has become a slippery concept. In fact, it is
often wrongly equated and conflated with a metaphysical position.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
Those who conflate say that because science studies nature as if
there are no non-physical influences and therefore has formulated
theories that make no reference to them, then science must be saying
there are no such things or that they are simply irrelevant to our
knowledge of the world. Neo-Darwinism in particular can give the
impression that God is absent in natural history; that if evolution
is true, then only natural selection and random gene mutations are
the causes of biodiversity. The emphasis on &lsquo;only&rsquo; seems
to indicate that God simply does not exist, or that God set up the
original laws and chance mechanisms, but is now absent so that nature
carries on without Him. Thus deism is as consistent with naturalism
as atheism is.</p>
<p>However, naturalism can remain a
methodology and resist a deistic or atheistic metaphysics.</p>
<p>One may say that God is ultimately the
cause of all phenomena, working in and through secondary causes to
create them, just as a computer programmer may create a programme to
construct images rather than creating them directly. In other words,
it can be said that God creates by natural processes; He seeks His
ends, in terms of cosmic creation and sustenance, by working in and
through nature. This is a view of God as the foundation of all
existence and diversity, but not acting directly in the mechanics of
nature.</p>
<p>Alternatively,
naturalistic theories can be seen as just one way of looking and
talking about the world. They do not falsify theistic ways of talking
about the world because they are part of a different language game.
There are different levels of reality, and science only picks out one
of them. A scientific language game serves one function, whereas a
religious or spiritual language game serves another function. They
are essentially different worlds of discourse and so cannot conflict
with one another. However, methodological naturalism and metaphysical
naturalism are not entirely different positions either. When
non-physical entities are not needed to explain anything (and
naturalistic scientific theories are purportedly full explanations),
then that calls into question the need to believe in them. God and
consciousness become unneeded hypotheses that make no difference to
our understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Methodological
naturalism is about the practice of scientific enquiry into the
natural world. George. G. Simpson says that he rejects supernatural
events not because of a metaphysical preference, but on &lsquo;necessary
heuristic grounds&rsquo;. (Simpson 1967)
The argument, in a nutshell, is that science cannot be productive
without rejecting non-physical causation. Conversely, it can only be
productive if it assumes (for methodological purposes) that every
event and object has a material cause. Why is this? Because science
places importance on tests: a proposition must be shown either true
or false by an experiment, demonstration, or observation. A necessary
condition of a test is that the event in question be repeatable, or
at least an event derivable from it must be testable. If we did not
assume gravity as an unbroken law, then there would be no way to
generate predictions about planetary movement (predictions that would
act as &lsquo;tests&rsquo; of the law's truth). Pennock writes that
&lsquo;Controlled, repeatable experimentation ... would not be
possible without the methodological assumption that supernatural
entities do not intervene to negate lawful natural regularities&rsquo;.
(Pennock, p. 89) Supernatural events negate
experimentation because they are supposed as inconsistent (unlawful).</p>
<p>Thus, methodological
naturalism is necessary for the empirical standard of science. If the
goal of science is to acquire a theoretical understanding of nature,
then to say that &lsquo;God was pleased to do it like that&rsquo;
(although that may be true) is not going to progress our theoretical
understanding: &lsquo;if God did it directly, there will be nothing
further to find out&rsquo;. (Pennock, p. 356)
For these reasons, scientists often say that non-natural causation,
if allowed in science, would end up as a &lsquo;science stopper&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>A magical God</strong></p>
<p>Plantinga, a noted
analytic philosopher and committed Calvinist, argues that Christians
need a science that &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t restricted by methodological
naturalism&rsquo;. (Pennock, p. 139) He
characterises contemporary science thus: &lsquo;God is a supernatural
being, hypotheses referring to him therefore deal with something
besides the natural; hence such hypotheses cannot be part of
science&rsquo;. (Pennock, p. 344) This is
problematic, for it seems that a scientist is allowed to retain
scientific integrity by saying &lsquo;God did X&rsquo;, hence
&lsquo;referring&rsquo; to God, as long as a cogent natural
explanation is also given or as long as he is not making a scientific
claim. A theist can always consider that God is directly working in
and through natural chance and necessity processes; but that need not
preclude a natural explanation too. The definition of science (as
naturalistic) is not an arbitrary a priori definition bolstered by a
naturalistically inclined community as Plantinga has been criticised
for suggesting, nor is it claimed to be an a posteriori proposition;
it's an explication of &lsquo;what scientists do&rsquo; because of
the heuristic reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>Methodological
naturalism, as the very term suggests, is a functional definition of
how science best operates, scientists argue. A scientist becomes
suspect (as a scientist, not as a person) when, without giving a
cogent natural explanation, he says &lsquo;God did X&rsquo;. Because
Plantinga wants to let this possibility into science, he is also
making a theological claim: that God does occasionally break the
causal chain, and that there are no natural explanations for some
events. Plantinga sees naturalism as an &lsquo;arbitrary&rsquo;
theological position because it restricts God&rsquo;s action to
secondary causes; the Christian doctrine leaves open the possibility
of divine intervention and special creation.</p>
<p>Regarding the
heuristic justification for methodological naturalism, Plantinga
argues that divine intervention could be both a &lsquo;science
stopper&rsquo; and true. It is absurd to see some thing that is true
as stopping science. Although as a &lsquo;general rule&rsquo; direct
causation &lsquo;does not make for good science&rsquo;, it does not
follow that theists should assume, for instance, that the universe
&lsquo;is just there&rsquo; &mdash; God must have done some things
directly. He writes that &lsquo;[if] after a great deal of study, we
cannot see how he created some phenomenon P (life, for example)
indirectly; thus probably he has created it directly&rsquo;.
(Pennock, p. 361) Some people are likely to
raise their eyebrows at this: &lsquo;But <I>when</I> does one
conclude God created P directly? Isn&rsquo;t the history of science
littered with cases of &ldquo;divine intervention&rdquo;, which were
later shown to be the result of perfectly natural causes?&rsquo;
Plantinga does not deal with this point.</p>
<p>A fundamental
assumption in Plantinga&rsquo;s thinking is that the world is
contingent: God could have decided to not make it at all, or could
have done it differently. Hence the need for a posteriori and not a
priori analysis to see how He did it. That means allowing for God&rsquo;s
direct action. At times methodological naturalism is useful, but at
other times it may not be; perhaps Christians should pursue their own
Augustinian science, utilising &lsquo;all the Christian knows&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>A cosmic musician</strong></p>
<p>Rev. Dr Arthur
Peacocke, winner of the 2001 Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion, is a trained scientist and that training
carries through in his approach to theology. He endorses &lsquo;theistic
naturalism&rsquo; as a philosophical understanding of nature. For him
this means that God does not intervene in the world&rsquo;s natural
laws; that we can rarely have enough evidence to believe in miracles;
that there is no soul or spiritual entity separate from matter aside
from God; that the details of the observed world do not require
recourse to an explanation outside of nature and they are not
predetermined by God; and that God does not directly alter nature in
response to prayer. (Peacocke 1993, pp. 191&ndash;213)
For Peacocke, God gave matter the necessary conditions to evolve into
life &mdash; we are space dust come alive. The world developed and
continues to develop according to the free play of chance within the
structure of laws. Just as a fugue takes one musical theme and layers
it over itself in a polyrhythmic fashion, similarly God unfolds the
universe in an improvised and developmental fashion. Science is the
tracing of the notes played by the universe. But Peacocke does not
think that God pushes or pulls the universe in any particular
direction, rather, through time and the right conditions, human life
(and all else) develops because matter has the inherent capacity to
do that. (Peacocke 2001, p. 75&ndash;80)</p>
<p>Peacocke is not
sceptical of contemporary science; he embraces it with gusto. He goes
so far as to assert that any &lsquo;exploration towards God&rsquo;
can only be based upon the scientific study of nature and humanity.
The method of this study ought not be the &lsquo;subjective&rsquo;,
&lsquo;less accessible&rsquo;, and &lsquo;more contentious&rsquo;
mysticism, but the &lsquo;widely accepted&rsquo; and &lsquo;justified
basis&rsquo; of natural science. (Peacocke 2001, p. 16) Nevertheless,
from scientific discoveries such as the fundamental laws of physics
and neo-Darwinian evolution, the best inference is an ultimate ground
of being or &lsquo;Ultimate Reality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are a few
things in nature that fascinate Peacocke, and he uses them to model
God&rsquo;s relationship with the world. For instance, &lsquo;dissipative
systems&rsquo; are meant to illustrate his theory of &lsquo;whole-part
influence&rsquo; (other times he calls it &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;).
Apparently, when a fluid is heated, the molecules cease to bounce
around randomly: they &lsquo;self-organise&rsquo; themselves. The
nature of the system as a whole (the fluid and the device it is being
heated in) causes the parts to act in a particular way (i.e., orderly
when heated). This too happens in gene switching: &lsquo;The parts
[genes] would not behave as observed if they were not parts of that
particular system [the body].&rsquo; (Peacocke 2001, p. 52) He points
out that science is becoming more aware that life is a web of
interconnected systems, each mutually affecting and being affected by
the other. He wants to consider this an ontological claim, as opposed
to a provisional, scientific claim. (Peacocke 2001, p. 55) This
introduces his theory of the &lsquo;flow of information&rsquo; in
hierarchical systems. For instance, the environment imprints
information on DNA in organisms via natural selection. The world is
full of such instances: systems of one level transmit information and
thus constrain, direct and guide systems of a lower level. He says
that the idea of &lsquo;information&rsquo; is not dependent upon the
matter and energy that is often its medium (at least in our
experience). If so, then information is contingent; but this seems at
odds with self-organising complexity, in which information arises
directly out of the properties of matter (a topic we take up later).</p>
<p>Peacocke notes that
some theologians, such as Polkinghorne, propose that God acts within
the unpredictabilities in the quantum world &lsquo;in a way that, in
practice, we could never detect&rsquo;. (Peacocke 2001, p. 103) Thus
God can act in the world, but because His action is in the shadows of
our knowledge, we may never notice it. But isn&rsquo;t this just the
old divine intervention in a modern guise? The staunch naturalist
Peacocke says &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and proposes another way of looking
at God&rsquo;s relationship with the world.</p>
<p>For Peacocke, God is
the world and more than the world &mdash; this view is called
&lsquo;panentheism&rsquo;. God is therefore immanent in the world by
creating, sustaining, and guiding the world in and through secondary
natural causes alone. Because God <I>is</I> the world (and more than
it), there are no ontological gaps between Him and the world.
(Peacocke 2001, p. 58)</p>
<p>With that background
knowledge, let us develop his thesis of God&rsquo;s interaction with
the world. The world is a &lsquo;system-of-systems&rsquo;, that is,
it consists of the interconnectedness of all subsystems, such as the
quantum, biological, and cosmological. It is somewhat analogous to
the human body: both have interconnected systems within systems. God
does not interact with the subsystems, but with the
&lsquo;world-as-a-whole&rsquo;. In dissipative systems the nature and
conditions of the whole system affect the individual units.
Similarly, God sets constraints and &lsquo;boundary conditions&rsquo;
upon the individual units by establishing the nature and conditions
of the universe as a whole. Put differently, just as the environment
places constraints upon, and determines the characteristics of,
organisms in it, so God institutes the state of the world and thereby
affects the things in the world. Put differently yet again, just as a
songwriter may determine the mood, tempo, and key of a song, but then
within those constraints improvise and create a song, similarly God
sets the conditions of the universe and improvises within those
constraints. Peacocke writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>By affecting its overall state, God
    could be envisaged as being able to exercise influence upon events in
    the myriad sublevels of existence of which it is made without
    abrogating the laws and regularities that specifically apply to them.
    Moreover, God would be doing this without intervening within the
    supposed gaps provided by the in-principle, inherent
    unpredictabilities. (Peacocke 2001, p. 109)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God therefore
implements his will not by interventions, but by influencing the
&lsquo;world-system&rsquo; as a whole. &lsquo;Any interaction of God
with the world-system would be initially with it as a whole&rsquo;,
and from that initial interaction His will would &lsquo;trickle-down&rsquo;
to the lower levels of complexity. (Peacocke 2001, p. 110) This form
of interaction is a &lsquo;flow of information&rsquo; from God to the
world as a whole. Peacocke also believes in bottom-up causality,
wherein the units also affect higher levels of the whole system.</p>
<p>But is the import of theistic
naturalism that, as Peacocke suggests, God is not needed to explain
the details of the world? And is the antithesis of theistic
naturalism divine intervention?</p>
<p><strong>Of lovers and gods: The Sankhya model
of theistic naturalism</strong></p>
<p>We have looked at
competing views from Plantinga and Peacocke regarding God&rsquo;s
relationship with the world. We will now look at Sankhya, an ancient
Indian natural philosophy, which is, I will argue, a form of
qualified theistic naturalism. I believe it illuminates the thesis
that there can be a theistic naturalism.</p>
<p>There are theistic
and atheistic versions of Sankhya; we shall focus on a theistic
rendition, from the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I>, because we are, after
all, attempting to see if theism can be friendly with naturalism. We
will look at how theistic Sankhya has developed an extensive set of
analogies and philosophical concepts to elucidate God&rsquo;s
relationship with the world.</p>
<p>Sankhya literally means &lsquo;to count
or enumerate&rsquo;. The general purpose of all Sankhya philosophy is
to give one knowledge of reality, which in turn frees one from error,
which then frees one from suffering. It is also said to prepare one
for meditation.</p>
<p>As
with most Indian philosophical systems, dates and original authorship
are difficult to discern; the traditions themselves often posit
radically different origins than those proposed by Western scholars
studying them. In the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I>, Sankhya is said to
originate from Kapila, an <I>avatara</I> (incarnation) of Visnu.
Kapila is the son of Kardama (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I>
3.24.29)<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
and Kardama is a son of Brahma (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I>
3.12.27).</p>
<p>Kapila&rsquo;s
teachings on Sankhya to his widowed mother, and Krsna&rsquo;s summary
of Sankhya to Uddhava, the famous statesman of Mathura, are presented
as the &lsquo;word of God&rsquo;. Hence the tradition views Sankhya
not as a speculative philosophy but as divine teaching. Krsna makes
explicit reference to previous Sankhya philosophies, (<I>Bhagavata
Purana</I> 1.22.4&ndash;6 and 11.24.1&ndash;2)
supposedly species of Kapila&rsquo;s original Sankhya.</p>
<p><I>Purusa and
prakrti</I></p>
<p>The meaning of
<I>purusa</I> varies according to text and context. In the <I>Bhagavata
Purana</I>, <I>purusa</I> either means the enjoyer of the material
world (the individual soul, present in each living thing) or God. God
is described in terms of three separate categories: <I>brahman</I>
(impersonal, lucid energy); <I>paramatma</I> (the aspect of God in
our heart, located in the world); and <I>bhagavan</I> (the Supreme
Person), transcendental to matter and possessor of the
omni-qualities. These categories are different aspects of one
non-dual spiritual substance. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 1.2.11)</p>
<p>The substance of the
material world is called <I>prakrti; </I>it is ontologically
different from Purusa<I>. Prakrti</I> is more than just the
phenomenological world, it is also the characteristic quality of the
material world itself and the substance of which everything material
is made. Although our universe is temporary, <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti
</I>is eternal; it existed before the world and will continue to be
the material cause of future worlds. In and through the process of
creation, subsistence, and annihilation, the total amount of energy
in the world remains the same<I>. Prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti
</I>is spoken of in terms of five &lsquo;gross&rsquo; elements
(earth, water, fire, air, and space) and three &lsquo;subtle&rsquo;
elements (mind, intelligence, and false ego); we shall introduce
other elements of <I>prakrti </I>later. In Sankhya, the effect
necessarily exists in its cause, and an effect is &lsquo;like&rsquo;
its cause; that is, the effect in some way resembles and is
constrained by the properties of the cause. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I>
11.24.17) <I>Prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti
</I>is the material cause of all phenomena, thus it contains all
properties and constituents of all phenomena.</p>
<p>The
distinction between God and the conscious living being<I> </I>(<I>jiva</I>)
is one of quantity, not quality. We are made of the same spiritual
energy as God, but less of it as evidenced by our subjection to time
and the constraints of our physical environment. Moreover, the <I>jiva</I>
is considered ontologically distinct from <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti</I>;
therefore it is different from body, mind, and intellect.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote8anc" HREF="#sdendnote8sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
Therefore, our true identity has nothing to do with our present
mental and physical condition, which is entirely rooted in <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti.
Prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti
</I>may also be called <I>k</I><I>s</I><I>etra</I>,
which denotes a space or situation where the <I>jiva </I>can act; and
the <I>jiva </I>is called <I>k</I><I>s</I><I>etra-jna</I>
or the perceiver of that field, although it is not part of it. The
ontological distinction between the self and matter, yet the
recognition of their gnarled and convoluted intertwining, differs
radically from Christian theology and contemporary philosophy.</p>
<p><I>Creation and
causality</I></p>
<p>As
mentioned previously, a key issue in naturalism is God&rsquo;s
relationship with the world. There are a number of analogies in
Sankhya and Vedic philosophies that elucidate this relationship; I
will develop two in this section. Visvanatha Cakravarti, a renowned
Vaisnava teacher, says that just as a king presides over his subjects
and delegates responsibilities to his ministers, God similarly
creates, maintains, and destroys this world through His material
energies without getting personally involved in the mechanics of the
universe.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote9anc" HREF="#sdendnote9sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
The second major analogy, found throughout the Vedas, is that of God
relating with the world just as a husband relates to his wife and
child.</p>
<p>At the beginning of
time, before the universe exists, <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti
</I>is in an unmanifest state, called <I>pradhana</I>. <I>Pradhana</I>
is an eternal and subtle substance that contains all of the latent
potentials and characteristics of the phenomenological world; it is
<I>prakrti</I> in a state of <I>samya</I> or equilibrium and rest.
(<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 3.26.10&ndash;13)
It contains the blueprints of the physical forms that will be later
manifest by an evolutionary process, as well as the ability to
perceive and the objects of perception. A contribution specific in
the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I> is that the <I>pradhana</I> is Brahman
(pure spirit) with the <I>gunas</I> (qualities of nature) added. The
<I>gunas</I> are qualitative and moral forces or modes. All objects
are imbued with a combination of the three <I>gunas</I>: <I>sattva</I>
or goodness and existence; <I>rajas</I> or passion and activity; and
<I>tamas</I> or ignorance and inertia. The concept of <I>gunas</I>
is, I believe, unique to Indian philosophy. Within the <I>pradhana</I>
the <I>gunas</I> are balanced such that no interactions occur between
them. In our own experience, <I>prakrti</I> is in an unbalanced state
and the transformation of it is due to the mixing of the <I>gunas</I>
with each other.</p>
<p>Creation takes place
when the <I>gunas</I> are disturbed or excited by the addition of
time by the Purusa. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 3.26.17)
Time is spoken of as the glance or thinking of God about the world.
As such, time is not part of <I>prakrti</I> or <I>pradhana</I>, but
comes from the Purusa, who is outside matter. It is because of time
or the thought of God that the latent potentials within the <I>pradhana</I>
begin to unfold, just as a spider releases its silk upon deciding to
build a web. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 11.24.16)
Time brings the unmanifested and motionless <I>pradhana</I> into
manifestation and motion; thus, without time&rsquo;s continued
influence there would be no universe. Along with such descriptions,
the <I>Bhagavata Purana</I> depicts the Purusa as placing His <I>virya</I>
(potency) in <I>prakrti</I>, &lsquo;She&rsquo; then proceeds to
&lsquo;deliver&rsquo; the universe. The rest of the story is a
complex description of subtle elements unfolding into more gross
elements, but all of the qualities of the final result are contained
in the original cause. &lsquo;Nothing comes from nothing&rsquo; is an
axiom of Sankhya. The development is naturalistic in the sense that
the <I>gunas</I>, time, and matter contain the necessary and
sufficient properties to develop the phenomenological world by
themselves; just as when a husband impregnates his wife, the
combination of semen and egg contain the biological capacities to
form a baby. In this analogy, the husband is the <I>puru</I><I>s</I><I>a</I>,
the wife <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti,</I>
and the universe is their offspring.</p>
<p>It is explained
that, once the fundamental aspects of the universe have been
actualised, God creates a secondary creator: Brahma, the celebrated
&lsquo;creator&rsquo; god. God Himself does not directly or
personally create what we know to be the world; He gives the
responsibility and power to a <I>jiva </I>soul. But Brahma is only
empowered; his potency is derived from a source greater than him.</p>
<p>Once the Purusa has
unleashed the <I>pradhana</I> by disrupting the <I>gunas</I>, Brahma
receives the power from God to substantiate planets, stars, and
living organisms. Brahma describes himself as &lsquo;manifest[ing]
the created potentials&rsquo; and as &lsquo;let[ting] forth the
emanation&rsquo;. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 2.5.11 and 20)
Commentators on the tradition have described him as the &lsquo;direct
creator of the manifest universe and everything within the universe&rsquo;.
(<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 2.5.3) Thus it
seems that Brahma is left with the work of assembling the universe,
as one might bake a cake once the ingredients and recipe have been
given.</p>
<p>The analogy used in
the commentarial tradition is that of seeds. The seeds (potentials)
are partially developed from the <I>pradhana</I>, and then handed
over to gods and humans to nourish and bring to fruition. There are
some obvious relationships with the notion of &lsquo;co-creation&rsquo;
as developed by some Christian theologians. The Sankhya tradition
also distinguishes between creating and discovering: Brahma does not
create the world, he discovers the process of unfolding the universe,
just as one might discover the process of manifesting a tree from a
seed; this is very different than creating the seed and tree. The
forms (in a Platonic sense) of objects have already been brought out
of the <I>pradhana</I> by the time Brahma arrives on the scene, but
only in a very subtle or conceptual sense. The nature of Brahma&rsquo;s
work, therefore, is to slowly utilise those concepts to manufacture
the constituents of our universe.</p>
<p>The overall point is
that Brahma is given the power to manifest the world by God so that
God&rsquo;s direct help and intervention is not required. But <I>devas
</I>such as Brahma are just as much a product of <I>prakrti</I> as
humans, plants and animals. That is why the phenomenological world is
considered to be governed by the <I>gunas</I> and not by the <I>devas</I>
&mdash; the devas too are under control of the <I>gunas</I>.
(<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 1.1.1) The <I>devas&rsquo;
</I>abilities and powers are constrained by the properties of
<I>prakrti</I>. They are not &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; agents like
the Purusa is. However, because the <I>devas</I> possess greater
power than a human possibly can, their interaction with our
phenomenological world may appear as &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo;.
Therefore, this model problematises the simple natural/supernatural
distinction of some theologians.</p>
<p>In terms of a human
being&rsquo;s experience of the world, that too is naturalistic in
character. A consistent theme in Sankhya is that the <I>perceived
</I>cause and effect, and the transformations of nature, are caused
by the interactions of the <I>gunas</I>, which are constituents of
<I>prakrti</I> alone. The <I>jiva </I>is bound, covered, and
conditioned to perceive the world in terms of natural cause and
effect by a complex matrix of cognitive structures. This gives one
the illusion that it is &lsquo;as if the world were materially
produced&rsquo;. (<I>Bhagavata Purana</I><I> </I>2.5.19)</p>
<p>There are parallels
to be drawn between Peacocke&rsquo;s notion of &lsquo;world-as-a-whole
influence&rsquo; and the Sankhya belief that the fundamental aspects
and latent potentials that become the world all exist within the
<I>pradhana</I>.</p>
<p>In both Sankhya and
top-down causality, God sets or designs the initial conditions of the
unmanifest world and then these play out or manifest over time.
Sankhya puts more emphasis on the unfolding of predetermined
potentials, whereas Peacocke, being influenced by Darwinian
evolution, puts more emphasis on the free interplay of chance and
necessity, which results in accidental forms. Sankhya says that the
most general form of the universe, as well as the general forms of
organisms, are eternal and to a certain extent necessary, whereas
Peacocke erases a strict teleological evolution by saying that the
way forms turn out is not predetermined by God (that is what I mean
by accidental). But the basic principle of God endowing abstracted
conditions of the world with specified characteristics and not
intervening as they unfold is the same. The Sankhya model, however,
is highly theoretical and the relationship between the <I>gunas</I>
and laws of nature needs to be filled out; it may need a stronger
empirical basis to become a viable theology of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifying methodological naturalism</strong></p>
<p>We have shown that
there are theistic ways of thinking about the world in a naturalistic
light by discussing God&rsquo;s relationship with the mechanisms of
Nature, but nothing of God&rsquo;s relationship with us has been
discussed. It is on the level of the self that I wish to qualify
theistic naturalism.</p>
<p>In Sankhya, the
thing we call &lsquo;life&rsquo; in all living things is not part of
<I>prakrti</I>; it possesses free will and is controlled by the
<I>gunas</I>, but it is able to become free of their influence.
(<I>Bhagavata Purana</I> 3.27.23) God
reciprocates with its desire, prayers, intentions, and action in a
way unconstrained by the <I>gunas</I>, laws of nature, or material
forces. Moreover, the concept of the <I>avatara</I> or &lsquo;incarnation&rsquo;
is prevalent in many Indian philosophies, and certainly in the
<I>Bhagavata Purana</I>. The point here is that God &lsquo;crosses
over&rsquo; from a realm beyond <I>prak</I><I>r</I><I>ti</I>
to help the living entities for the sake of <I>rasa</I>, or spiritual
relationship with those devoted to God.</p>
<p>For management of
the universe, God created a closed system and its development is left
to gods, humans, and the <I>gunas</I>. But in terms of <I>rasa</I>,
spiritual relationship, naturalism may not apply in all cases. God
does intervene in Nature&rsquo;s workings, but not for reasons as
mundane as cosmic management &mdash; God has better things to do!</p>
<p>If God reciprocates
with our free will and so forth, then does God&rsquo;s action
interrupt what would be the normal ebb and flow of nature&rsquo;s
mechanisms? That is a question left unanswered here; we have only
wished to show that in terms of nature&rsquo;s mechanisms,
methodological naturalism can be justified as a legitimate approach
with a theistic conception of the universe. In speaking of how the
actions of free, non-physical agents affect the world, methodological
naturalism becomes more suspect.</p>
