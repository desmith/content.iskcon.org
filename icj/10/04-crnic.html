          <p><strong>The study</strong></p>
          <p><I>The
purpose</I></p>
<p>The
Hare Krsna
movement is among the oldest, biggest, best organised and probably
the most active, noticeable, and recognisable &lsquo;new&rsquo;
religious movement in Slovenia. The main purpose of my empirical
study of the Hare Krsna
movement and its members, which was carried out as part of my
doctoral research project, was to obtain basic information on the
community, its development and activities, way of life, daily
routines, etc. One of the primary goals of this research project was
to identify the Slovene members of the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON); determine how long they have been
members; how deeply involved these members are in the activities of
the Society; how intense their religious practice is; to what extent
they follow religious doctrine; and what their religious background
was<B> </B>prior to entering into the community. Another purpose of
the research was to establish to what extent (if at all) members of
the community differ from the wider Slovene population according to
socio-demographic characteristics and viewpoints. I also endeavoured
to examine the similarities and differences between ISKCON members
and active Roman Catholics.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p><em>Methodological background</em></p>
<p>The basic
methodological approach of this research was triangulation (a
combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods). In the
first phase, which started in the middle of 1999, I used ethnographic
methods (mainly participant observation and unstructured and
half-structured interviews) to gather basic information on ISKCON and
its adherents in Slovenia.</p>
<p>The ISKCON
community in Slovenia mainly consists of the temple in Ljubljana as
well as a number of smaller congregational groups throughout the
country. I participated intensively in various activities in the
temple and visited devotees who lived outside the temple in their own
households. I visited two smaller groups of members (mainly students)
who lived in small residential communities in Ljubljana (or its
vicinity), and four families with small children. I interviewed seven
former members who, for different reasons, are no longer active in
the community (some of them have severed all contact with the
community, others still visit the temple occasionally and perform
some religious duties at home, some left ISKCON and joined another
Vaisnava
organisation).</p>
<p>In autumn 2000, on
the basis of information and knowledge gained by using ethnographic
research methods, I formed a questionnaire with 79 variables. From
the very beginning there was a question of who should be involved in
the sample, since the community does not have a well-defined
membership. In the first phase I decided to involve the initiated
members. However, in the process of qualitative research I soon
realised that those who had not yet been initiated represented the
majority of the active members. In the end, the sample involved all
persons who declared themselves to be &lsquo;practising <I>bhakti-yoga</I>&rsquo;
(Krsna
consciousness).</p>
<p>Between
December 2000 and February 2001, I gathered 116 completed
questionnaires. Although the respondents did not form a
representative sample of all the Hare Krsna
devotees in Slovenia, from a strict methodological perspective they
did represent a random sample and it did include most of the Slovene
devotee community. Therefore the results obtained from the survey
enable a generalisation of the whole Slovene ISKCON population.</p>
<p>I compared the
values of certain variables with values measured on the wider Slovene
population. When doing the comparisons, I used data from the surveys
of the &lsquo;Slovene Public Opinion Survey 1997/2: International
Research on Religion and Attitudes toward Church&rsquo; (Aufbruch
1997), and the &lsquo;Slovene Public Opinion Survey 1998/1:
International Survey of Inequality and Religion&rsquo; (ISSP 1998
Religion), carried out by the Public Opinion and Mass Communication
Research Centre at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana.</p>
<p>One of the main
purposes of the research was to establish the differences and
similarities between Roman Catholics and ISKCON devotees in Slovenia.
Because of the high intensity of religiosity of the adherents of
ISKCON, I found it sensible to make comparisons with only those Roman
Catholics whose religious practice is intensive and not with all
respondents who regard themselves as Catholics. For that reason, I
chose only those who declared themselves Roman Catholic Church <I>and</I>
who identified themselves as being either fairly religious, very
religious, or deeply religious, and who attended religious ceremonies
at least once a month and prayed at least once a week.</p>
<p>Due to the small size of the sample, I
also took into consideration some results of the analysis which do
not meet the recommended statistical criteria of significance, since
it can be expected that in these cases the statistical significance
would increase with the growth of the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Krsna
consciousness in Slovenia</strong></p>
<p>The
beginnings of ISKCON in Slovenia go back to the early 1980s, when
devotees brought the movement from Croatia. At the beginning, they
rented an apartment for their meetings and religious ceremonies in
Ljubljana.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
In 1989 they rented a house and adopted it as their first temple. The
movement was officially registered as a religious community in 1983
under the name &lsquo;Society for Krishna Consciousness&rsquo;. In
December 1992 the community moved into a bigger house (which it later
bought), where the &lsquo;Hare Krishna Centre&rsquo; still exists
today. The centre (or temple) has two functions: it enables spiritual
education of the adherents living in the community, and it provides
cultural and spiritual education for its congregational members and
visitors. The temple&rsquo;s regular activities include a Sunday
programme (with spiritual music, a lecture on Krsna consciousness,
and vegetarian food), morning and evening lectures on a daily basis,
and traditional worshipping (<I>arati</I>). Apart from these
activities, the community organises <I>nama-hattas</I>, regular
meetings of congregational members in towns across Slovenia. Their
activities also include the translating and selling of books (to
date, ten books by the movement&rsquo;s founder, Srila Prabhupada,
have been translated into Slovene). Within the international
humanitarian project &lsquo;Food for Life&rsquo;, the devotees
deliver food to the homeless and the poor. They occasionally visit
retirement homes, prisons, and residences for the disabled. The
community organises a <I>bhakti-yoga</I> summer school and seminars
for congregational members and others who are interested. The
community also occasionally organises other cultural and spiritual
programmes and courses across Slovenia.</p>
<p>The movement gained
wide publicity in 1990 with the first &lsquo;Hare Krishna Festival&rsquo;.
There was a similar reaction to the second &lsquo;Hare Krishna
Festival&rsquo; in 1993, which took place in a sports hall in the
centre of Ljubljana, where more than two thousand people attended.
Due to such positive reaction to the second festival, as well as
frequent lectures by ISKCON spiritual leaders across Slovenia, a
number of new adherents moved into the temple. A pop-rock musical
group, Transcendence, also emerged. Furthermore, a large <I>prasadam</I>
(sanctified food) distribution programme began and the selling of
books became extremely successful.</p>
<p>However, the
rigorous and strict discipline that dominated the temple in this
early period did not suit many adherents; therefore, some of them
left the temple and moved abroad after several conflicts with the
community leadership. This pattern continued until about the end of
1995. Many devotees moved to Italy, where the atmosphere was
considered more liberal and where many of the temples were facing a
shortage of manpower.</p>
<p>The year 1994 was
marked by <I>padayatra,</I> an international group of Krsna devotees
who travelled on foot with oxen through many countries spreading
information on Vedic culture. It travelled across Slovenia from early
June till mid-July and drew wide media response. Several Slovene
devotees joined the caravan; many followed it after it left Slovenia
and travelled with it all the way to Moscow. The distribution of
<I>prasadam</I> was still very intensive in this period. The devotees
who were not successful at selling books were selling food (samosas,
sandwiches, etc.). In that period the kitchen in the temple produced
from 200 to 300 sandwiches (&lsquo;bliss-burgers&rsquo;, as they were
called) and the same amount of samosas daily. Gradually, the number
of devotees translating books increased and many devotees were sent
to temples abroad (mainly Sweden) to be educated in the field of
translating. During the summer Transcendence had a number of very
successful concerts across Slovenia (often performing three or more
times a week). In this period the boundaries between the devotees
from the temple and those from the congregation (adherents who do not
live in the temple but maintain their own households) began to
diminish.</p>
<p>In 1995 some new
adherents came to live in the temple; there was also an increase in
initiations. Book distribution was carried out by ten devotees, who
sold about 2000 books each week. During this period serious tensions
arose between the book distributors and the temple leadership.
Transcendence gave numerous concerts across Slovenia in the summer.
There was also a new group formed called Gopinath, which played
traditional Indian music.</p>
<p>In 1996, Deities of
Gaura-Nitai were installed and all the necessary requisites for deity
worship were set up in the temple. During this period, marked by new
leadership in the temple, many devotees moved out, and the first
marriage ceremony was conducted. At that time, the community saw this
marriage in an extremely negative light, and the two newly married
devotees were practically excommunicated. Also in 1996, a summer camp
was organised for the first time and many adherents took part
(including several from the congregation, additionally blurring the
distinction between the &lsquo;inner&rsquo; and &lsquo;outer&rsquo;
members of the community).</p>
<p>The highest recorded
number of devotees lived in the temple at the end of 1996 and the
beginning of 1997. Book distribution was still successful. Many
members took part in the summer camp in the Croatian seaside town
Pula. Initiations were very common in this period and, for the first
time, initiation was conferred to devotees who did not live in the
temple. Towards the end of 1997 many members of the community married
and moved out of the temple. There was also the first official
divorce of a couple married according to the traditional Vedic rules.
Quite a few devotees gradually distanced themselves from the temple.
Some of them entered the Gaudiya
Math: another Vaisnava
organisation.</p>
<p>The first, and thus
far only, major public scandal connected to the Slovene ISKCON Temple
occurred in 1997. One of the members moved out of the centre saying
that he had been sexually assaulted while there. He demanded a large
sum of money from the community, which in turn considered suing him
for slander. Although the incident initially received wide media
attention, it eventually quietened down and no legal action was taken
by either side.</p>
<p>In
1998 a transformation from temple community to congregational
community took place. Many leading devotees moved out of the temple
and started to lead the community from outside. At the end of the
previous year, the leadership was taken over by three older devotees,
who adjusted the activities of the community to the needs of
<I>g</I><I>r</I><I>hastas,</I>
the married householders. In the summer of 1998, the community faced
another turning point when Harikesa
Swami, the guru of most of the older devotees, left ISKCON. The
community fell into a crisis, and many of its members left.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
During this period a large number of other gurus visited Slovenia,
and many new devotees received initiation from them. <I>Sangas</I>,<I>
</I>weekly meetings for congregational members to worship and
associate, became a regular activity and a large number of members
joined the second summer camp in Pula.</p>
<p>In 1999 most senior
devotees left the temple, even though they remained fairly active in
their own religious practice. The temple residents were now mainly
young, uninitiated <I>brahmacaris,</I> many from Croatia. Book
distribution declined significantly with only six devotees still
selling books. There were more divorces, and even more devotees
joined other Vaisnava
organisations such as the Gaudiya
Math.<I> </I>Many completely abandoned religious practice, and it was
getting harder to define who was actually a member of the Krsna
conscious community.</p>
<p>In
the following years (up to the beginning of 2002), a number of
devotees experienced break-ups or disruptions in their married life.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
Devotee marriages appear to be no more stable than marriages of other
people. The senior devotees dispersed and integrated into wider
society. Many expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership of the
temple, believing it to hold negative attitudes toward them;
meanwhile, the temple devotees expressed a concern that the older
devotees who left the temple were not following the principles
strictly or meeting the standards of living in the community to a
satisfactory degree. A large number of those who left the temple
remained faithful to ISKCON, but there were also many who interpreted
Krsna
and Vaisnavism
in their own way. This causes additional difficulty in estimating how
many ISKCON members there are in Slovenia, since there are no clear
rules and criteria by which we can judge who is or isn&rsquo;t a
member.</p>
<p><strong>The number of devotees in the community</strong></p>
<p>The
community itself does not have an exact record of its members.
According to estimates from the community leadership, there are a few
thousand members. However, after a thorough survey of the community
and several interviews with current and former members, this number
appears to be an overestimate. The number of Slovene devotees who
have been initiated up to the present day does not exceed two
hundred. Some 150 of these have first initiation, and not more than
fifty have second (<I>brahmana</I>) initiation. The majority of
initiated devotees are no longer active (which can clearly be seen
from the results of the quantitative part of the research: only 27
respondents have first initiation, and 19 have second). In Slovenia,
non-initiated adherents are clearly in the majority, but their exact
number is very difficult to estimate, again due to unclear criteria
for membership.</p>
<p>According to the
estimated data provided by the community leadership, the following
number of devotees lived in the Ljubljana temple:</p>

<p>However, the
leadership admits that these are only the estimated numbers, since
the community does not have a reliable record either of its members
or the residents of the temple during different periods. The data
gathered between 1992 and 2000 in the personal diary of a devotee,
who is (according to his activities and beliefs) today situated at
the very margins of the community, appear more accurate. His account
of the number of residents in the temple is as follows:</p>

<p>Both sets of figures
show the same trend: an increase in the number of temple residents up
until 1996/97, and then a considerable decrease due to the transition
into the congregational phase (this being even more evident when
looking at the number of all adherents of the community).</p>
<p>The numbers of the
members who left the community are also of interest.</p>

<p>In total, 183
devotees left ISKCON over this period. We can see that a large number
of members left the community at the end of 1990s (from 1998). As
mentioned previously, a number of these joined other Vaisnava
organisations, some still adhere to Vaisnava
principles outside of any organisation, and others abandoned Krsna
consciousness.</p>
<p>As with most new
religious movements in the West, ISKCON in Slovenia has a small
membership. According to our estimates, there are approximately one
hundred adherents forming the active core of the community, and there
are twice as many around this core. Those in the second group are
less active and, according to their beliefs and activities, less
faithful to the official doctrine of ISKCON, but they feel that they
are in some way connected to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Socio-demographic characteristics of
the community members</strong></p>
<p>Of
the membership, 61% are men and 39% women. At the time of the survey,
the respondents were aged between 15 and 61 years. The average age
was 30, with 78% between 21 and 35 years old. A large majority of the
participating members have Slovene nationality (88%); 10% are
Croatian. The Hare Krsna
movement was brought from Croatia, which accounts for the strong
connections between the Slovene and the Croatian communities. The
percentage of Croatian devotees is still surprisingly high since
Croatia has a larger number of centres (five temples). One of the
reasons many decided to move to Slovenia was the war which Croatia
was fighting during the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The
adherents of ISKCON in Slovenia appear to be better educated than
most Slovenes, with&nbsp;more than half of the respondents having
finished high school, and almost a quarter finishing college or
university (some of these to MA or PhD level). Only 2% had not
finished primary school. The parents of the Krsna
devotees also had a higher level of education than those of the wider
population or of practising Catholics.</p>

<p>Forty-two percent of
the respondents have a full-time job; 32% are high school or
university students; and 10% are unemployed. If we compare these data
to those of the whole Slovene population (SPO 98/1), we can see that
there are large differences, particularly in the category of
high-school and university students and the retired (only 4% of
devotees are retired, whereas 29% of the general Slovene population
are retired). These differences can be ascribed to the differences in
the ages of the devotees and the whole population. We can also note
that the percentage of devotees in employment (42%) is lower than
that in the wider population (54%), and that there are slightly more
unemployed devotees (10%) compared to the whole Slovene population
(8%). Two-thirds of the devotees have a regular monthly income, one
third don&rsquo;t (interestingly, there are no significant gender
distinctions in this).</p>
<p>The
majority of devotees (60%) live in Ljubljana or Maribor, the two
biggest Slovene towns; 13% of them live in some other big town or its
suburbs. Almost a fifth (19%) live in the countryside or in a small
town. When these data are compared to the data of the general Slovene
population (SPO 97/2), there is an unusually high percentage of Krsna
devotees (almost three-quarters) who reside in urban centres
(compared to a quarter of the general population), and a considerably
smaller percentage in the rural environment, where the great majority
of the Slovene population (65%) lives. This difference is even bigger
when a comparison is done with active Catholics, most of whom (79%)
live in villages or small towns.</p>
<p>Forty-two
percent of the respondents live with their parents. A quarter (26%)
live in a rented flat or a house, about a fifth (22%) in a flat or
house they own, and a tenth (10%) in the temple. Some obvious
differences can be noticed when this data is compared to that of the
whole Slovene population (SPO 98/1). A large majority of Slovenes
(77%) reside in houses and flats that they own, and only a small
proportion in rented accommodation (6%). Furthermore, there is also a
difference in the percentage of those who live with their parents
(only 16% of the wider population). The main reason for these
differences is probably the age structure of the ISKCON devotees who,
on average, are considerably younger than the general Slovene
population.</p>
<p>Almost
one half of the respondents are single; a similar percentage are
married or engaged. The majority of women are married or engaged. The
situation of men shows, however, the opposite (see table 7). The
percentage of single devotees<I> </I>is clearly higher than the wider
Slovene population. These differences could again be explained by the
age differences between devotees and the wider population.</p>
<p>We can also see that
the prevalence of divorce in ISKCON is similar to that of the general
population (but considerably higher than that of active Catholics).</p>

<p>A high percentage of
married or engaged members (84%) are married or engaged to a member
of the Hare Krsna
movement. This high percentage of the partners who belong to the
community is understandable considering the intensity of religious
practice, which has an extremely strong and immediate influence on
the everyday life of its adherents.</p>
<p>Less than a quarter
of the respondents (24%) have children; much lower than the wider
population (76% of Slovenes have children). Again, this can at least
partially be explained by the difference in the age structure between
the Slovene population and the adherents of the Hare Krsna
movement. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that lately ISKCON in
Slovenia has been going through a &lsquo;baby boom&rsquo; stage,
since there are ten families expecting babies at the time of my
writing this article.</p>
<p><strong>Religious background of Slovene Krsna
devotees</strong></p>
<p>Before
joining the Hare Krsna
movement, more than half (56%) of the respondents did not belong to
any religion and 44% of them were Christians, mostly Catholic.</p>
<p>Sixty
percent of the respondents come from religious families (94% of which
were Christian and 5% Vaisnava)
compared to 80% of the wider population who come from Catholic
families.</p>
<p>Almost
three quarters of devotees (73%) were baptised, slightly less than
the Slovene average. According to data from the Roman Catholic
Church, 81% of the inhabitants of Slovenia are baptised. Table 8 also
shows that Sunday school was attended by far fewer Krsna
devotees than the Slovene average. Those who did attend did so for a
shorter duration than the Slovene average.</p>

<p> (a)
There were no significant differences according to gender or
initiation among devotees.</p>

<p>More
than half of the respondents (56%) have always believed in God, while
44% of respondents believe in God today, but did not in the past. The
vast majority (97%) of active Catholics have always believed in God</p>
<p><strong>Involvement in the
Vaisnava
community and attitude towards it</strong></p>
<p>The
involvement of the respondents was measured by analyses of: their
initiation and its duration; the duration of their belonging to the
community; their lives in the temple; and the duration of their
residence in the temple.</p>
<p>The
attitude of the adherents towards ISKCON in Slovenia was measured by
analyses of: their feeling of connectedness with the community; their
attitude towards the public activities of the community; and the
frequency of financial contributions to the community.</p>
<p>The
reported duration of Krsna-conscious
practice ranged from six months to seventeen years, with an average
of slightly less than six years. Fifty-one percent reported
practicing for five years or less, 44% between five and ten years,
and only 5% more than 10 years.</p>
<p>Three-fifths
of the respondents are not initiated, two-fifths of them are.
Twenty-four percent of the respondents have first initiation and 16%
have second (<I>brahmana</I>) initiation.</p>
<p>The
period since first initiation ranged from one to nine years, with a
reported average of four years. Almost half of the respondents have
been initiated for three years or less. There are considerably more
men than women with second initiation and women generally have been
initiated for a shorter period than men. This distinction is not
particularly surprising, due to the general lower position of women
in ISKCON.</p>

<p>Only thirteen
respondents (11%) live in the temple. On average, they have lived
there for three-and-a-half years with reported durations ranging from
six months to nine years. Most (62%) have lived in the temple for
three years or less, 23% from three to six years, and 15% more than
six years.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight
percent of respondents had lived in the temple at some time. Men
lived in the temple more often than women (42% of all men and 28% of
all women). Initiated adherents also lived in the temple more often
than the non-initiated ones (20% of non-initiated, 54% of first
initiated and 82% of second initiated). They lived in the temple
between six months and twelve years and slightly, with an average of
slightly more than three-and-a-half years. The largest number of the
respondents lived in the temple for one year. Half lived there for
less than three years.</p>
<p>When
analysing the number of the adherents who live or lived in the
temple, and the periods of time of their stay in the temple, it is
important to consider the transition from the &lsquo;temple&rsquo; to
the &lsquo;congregation&rsquo;. Most adherents today live in their
own households and actively participate in the activities in the
temple (67% visit the temple at least once a week).</p>
<p>More
than two-thirds of the devotees stated that they are closely or very
closely connected with the community, while a quarter feel little or
no connection with the community. We get a clearer picture of the
level of connectedness of Slovene devotees when this data is compared
to the level of connectedness of active Catholics with the Roman
Catholic Church. It appears that Catholics feel slightly more
connected with their church than Krsna
devotees with their community. Eighty percent of active Catholics
(compared to 65% of ISKCON adherents) feel very closely or closely
connected with their community.</p>

<p>The majority of
devotees (79%) contribute financially to the community: 57%
contribute a few times a year; 22% contribute every month; 21% never
contribute financially.</p>
<p>The
majority of the respondents (83%) believe that the Slovene devotees
are not active enough in public; 16% believe that the level of
activity is sufficient; while 1% (one respondent) believes that in
the past three years, the community has been too active in public.
These results suggest that the Slovene devotees are not satisfied
with the drastic decrease in public activities of Slovene ISKCON that
occurred after the transition from the &lsquo;temple&rsquo; to the
&lsquo;congregational&rsquo; phase.</p>
<p><strong>Intensity of religious practice</strong></p>
<p>The intensity of
religious practice was examined by analysing: the frequency of the
respondents&rsquo; visits to the temple; the participation at <I>sangas</I>
(groups external to the temple); the number of hours individuals
devote to reciting <I>mantras</I>, worshipping deities, and reading
of holy texts.</p>
<p>We also measured the
percentage of adherents who have an altar at home and the frequency
with which devotees felt a sense of genuine, personal contact, and
closeness with Krsna.</p>
<p>The majority of
respondents (67%) visit the temple at least once a week. They visit
<I>sangas</I> (regular weekly meetings organised in different towns
across Slovenia) slightly less often (but more than a third of them
at least once a week). To some members of the community, particularly
those who live far from Ljubljana, <I>sangas</I>, to some extent,
represent a substitute for the activities in the temple. Most
devotees, however, perceive <I>sangas</I> as an addition to their
regular temple visits.</p>
<p>Members of the
community are also active at home, where the majority of the
respondents have an altar with Deities, pictures of Deities and all
other requisites for daily ritual worshipping. All the devotees with
first initiation and the majority (94%) of those with second
initiation have an altar at home. There is a lower percentage (70%)
of non-initiated members who have an altar at home.</p>
<p>The respondents
devote up to fifteen hours daily to fundamental religious activities
(the reciting of the Hare Krsna<I> maha-mantra</I>, the worshipping
of Deities and the reading of holy texts). On average, they devote
slightly more than three hours daily, with most devoting between one
and five hours daily to these activities. Men generally devoted more
of their time to these activities than women, with the majority of
women (56%) dedicating less than two hours daily, and the majority of
men (62%) dedicating more than two hours daily. Men dominate
particularly among those who devote more than five hours daily to
fundamental religious activities (16% of male respondents compared to
5% of female respondents).</p>
<p><em>Comparison with Catholics</em></p>
<p>The
intensity of religious practice of Slovene ISKCON devotees was
compared with the intensity of religious practice of Slovene
Catholics. With that purpose we analysed the frequency of visits for
religious ceremonies and the frequency of prayers among the
self-declared &lsquo;religious&rsquo; Catholics (those who declared
themselves as belonging to the Roman Catholic Church and being
fairly, very, or deeply religious). The self-declared religious
Catholics are considerably less active (32% of them attend religious
ceremonies at least once a week, 35% of them pray at least once a
day) than the Krsna
devotees who generally attend ceremonies in the temple (and/or
<I>sangas</I>) at least once a week, and devote several hours daily
to fundamental religious activities. For this reason, we also
compared the intensity of religious practice of the Krsna
devotees with that of &lsquo;active&rsquo; Catholics: those who
attend religious ceremonies at least once a month and pray at least
once a week.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym" SDFIXED><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
We can see that there are fewer differences between the intensity of
religious activities of active Catholics and the intensity of
devotees, with most (66%) active Catholics attending religious
ceremonies at least once a week and 59% praying at least once a
day.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym" SDFIXED><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP></p>
<p>The
experience of having personal contact with God is more frequent among
Krsna
devotees than Catholics. The majority of devotees had this experience
several times or often, while the majority of active Catholics (60%)
never experienced a similar contact with Jesus. We can also see that
the initiated devotees have this experience more often than the
non-initiated ones.</p>

devotees also reported feeling more distanced from God than did
Catholics. While a large majority of active Catholics (86%) feel

Furthermore, 14% of devotees do not feel close to God, whereas 6% of

<p><strong>Orthodoxy of Krsna
devotees</strong></p>
<p>The
orthodoxy of the Slovene devotees was examined by observing the
extent to which followers adhere to basic religious rules and
commandments. We analysed the extent to which Krsna
devotees adhere to the four regulative principles in their everyday
life: mercy, exhibited in the consumption of strictly vegetarian food
only; austerity, exhibited in prohibition from consuming all kinds of
stimulants and drugs, including alcohol, tobacco, coffee or tea;
chastity, exhibited in abstinence from sexual intercourse outside
marriage and from all intercourse within marriage without the purpose
of conceiving; and truthfulness, exhibited in a prohibition of
gambling.</p>
<p>Additionally,
we surveyed the extent to which they would like these rules to be
applied to society as a whole and to what extent the respondents
would be willing to conform to social rules which contradict their
religious principles.</p>
<p>According
to the data, the majority of respondents largely adhere to the four
regulative principles. Almost three-quarters of the respondents had
not partaken in gambling since joining ISKCON. One fifth of the
respondents took part in gambling as an exception. The answers on
consuming meat, fish or eggs show similar results.</p>

<p>The prohibition on
the consumption of any intoxicating substance is strictly adhered to
by a smaller percentage of the respondents. We can also see that
<I>brahmanas</I> (adherents with second initiation) follow the
principle of austerity to the highest extent, and that the least
observant respondents to this principle are the uninitiated members.
While a smaller percentage of initiated devotees had only
exceptionally consumed any intoxicating substances since they joined
the movement, almost a quarter of non-initiated adherents had
consumed intoxicating substances at times or often.</p>

<p>We also asked the
respondents what their reaction would be to a law which contradicted
their religious principles and their doctrine. Which would they
respect: the law or the religious principle? Two-thirds of devotees
would adhere to the religious principle. This is similar to the
answers of active Catholics who responded to the same question. On
the other hand, while only 7% of the responding devotees would
respect the law, a considerably higher percentage of active Catholics
would decide to follow it.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>ISKCON has been
actively present in Slovenia since the mid-eighties, where it is
currently in a phase of intensive change. During the late 1990s the
majority of the members left the monastic life in the temple for an
active life in society, transforming the so-called &lsquo;temple&rsquo;
community into a &lsquo;congregational&rsquo; community. The
consequence of this transition is less tension between the community
and its surroundings; at the same time, there has been a decline in
public activities of the community, and consequently in its
recognition.</p>
<p>In Slovenia, ISKCON
has a core of members that is small in number but relatively well
connected with each other. The devotees are by no means people who
live on the margins of the society. They are mostly young, active,
well educated, people who usually live in urban environments.</p>
<p>Compared to the
whole Slovene population, ISKCON devotees come from less religious
environments. During their childhood they were less religiously
socialised and, on average, less religious than Slovenes before they
entered ISKCON.</p>
<p>Compared to Catholics, ISKCON&rsquo;s
Slovene devotees are far more active and considerably more consistent
in their religious activities. A high level of orthodoxy can be
noticed in their attitude toward the generally accepted rules of the
wider society.</p>

	Two more gurus with a fairly large number of adherents in Slovenia,
