<blockquote>
  <p><em>The
    early years of ISKCON were times of intense activity under the
    guidance of ISKCON&rsquo;s founder, His Divine Grace A. C.
    Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada actively embraced
    twentieth-century technology to broadcast his message, ensuring an
    enormous legacy of photographs, writings, sound and video recordings,
    and other materials. Within the whirlwind that was ISKCON in its
    early days, there was a danger that some of this valuable material
    would be lost. The Bhaktivedanta Archives, which this year marks its
    25<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary, is charged with the task of collecting,
    restoring, and maintaining material from this time. In this article,
    Ranjit Dasa outlines the history of the Bhaktivedanta Archives,
    examines the challenges facing the Archives, and the strategies
    adopted to meet these challenges.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A history of the Bhaktivedanta Archives</strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning</em></p>
<p>Before he had any
followers, before he founded ISKCON, Srila Prabhupada purchased a
tape recorder to record his lectures and some of his writings.
<I>Introduction to the Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I>, recorded on 19 and
20 February 1966, is the earliest of these recordings in the
Bhaktivedanta Archives. The purchase of this tape recorder may seem a
trifle to us today, but for him it was a big expense at $54 (at that
time a month&rsquo;s rent for his room was $70). This tape recorder
was stolen shortly afterwards, but his followers provided him with
another, and the work of taping his lectures continued.</p>
<p>These tape
recordings continued in a more or less organised way for some years.
Early disciples of Srila Prabhupada such as Hayagriva Dasa, Hamsaduta
Dasa, and Govinda Dasi kept collections of tapes.</p>
<p>In these early days,
the photo collection was also begun. One can see that there are very
few photos of Srila Prabhupada from 1966. The only photos that exist
from this time are from newspaper articles or culled from amateur
films like George Witty&rsquo;s<I> Happiness on 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
Avenue</I>. An account from Gargamuni Dasa, one of the early
disciples, tells that when Srila Prabhupada was leaving New York for
San Francisco in January of 1967, he was asked how the devotees
should remember him. His reply was that they should place his picture
on his seat in the storefront temple. On returning to the temple, the
devotees discovered that they had no pictures of Srila Prabhupada! So
Gargamuni purchased a camera and went to San Francisco to take
pictures and sent them back to the temple. In San Francisco, Gurudasa
became the photographer, and thousands of the black and white photos
that we have of Srila Prabhupada and early ISKCON activities were
taken by him.</p>
<p>Around this time,
many of the photos were used in <I>Back to Godhead</I> magazine,
especially photos of the early <I>harinama</I> (public chanting)
parties and events such as Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s arrival in
New York and various preaching engagements.</p>
<p>With the formal
establishment of ISKCON&rsquo;s publishing arm, the Bhaktivedanta
Book Trust (BBT), in 1972, devotees began maintaining the audio and
photo departments more systematically. They purchased two
reel-to-reel Uher tape-recorders, one for India and one for the rest
of the world, to accompany Srila Prabhupada on his travels, and
photographers were provided with cameras and slide film to take
pictures. Visakha Devi Dasi, Muralivadana Dasa, and Bhargava Dasa
became the official photographers for the BBT. Also in 1972,
Krsna-Kanti Dasa founded the Golden Avatar studio and started
producing<B> </B>three audiocassettes per week for distribution to
devotees all over the world. Many of us remember responding to the
ads in <I>Back to Godhead </I>magazine to subscribe.</p>
<p><em>The Bhaktivedanta Tape Ministry</em></p>
<p>In
early 1977 it was decided to create the Bhaktivedanta Tape Ministry,
under the supervision of Parama-rupa Dasa, and to separate it from
the Golden Avatar operation. Parama-Rupa went to the Golden Avatar
studios in Culver City, where the tapes had been sitting in a room
open to the public and largely unsupervised, and brought the
reel-to-reel tapes to the BBT building on the corner of Venice
Boulevard and Watseka Avenue. The tapes filled the entire kitchen of
apartment 5. This was the basis from which the archives were to
begin.</p>
<p>Most of the tapes
were in boxes, many unmarked. Many bore no indication of when or
where they were recorded. Some were production run-masters, some were
originals, and it was impossible to tell which were which without
listening to the tapes.</p>
<p>In 1978 Ekanatha
Dasa arrived in Los Angeles and was given the service of helping
catalogue the tapes. He began the arduous task of separating
originals from duplication run-masters and changing the cataloguing
to the current system based on the date and place of the original
recording. Over the following fifteen years, through the 1980s, the
Tape Ministry was gradually increased until there were 711 tapes.</p>
<p><em>Foundation of the Bhaktivedanta
Archives</em></p>
<p>In early 1978, only
two months after Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s passing away, Parama-rupa
Dasa arranged with Radha-vallabha Dasa, the BBT production manager,
to officially create an archive as a separate section of the BBT
production department.<B> </B>Devotees were approached to donate
their letters, original photographs, tapes, and other memorabilia of
Srila Prabhupada. This created an outpouring of historical materials.
From time to time, the archive (now known as the Bhaktivedanta
Archives) has sent out requests to devotees all over the world to try
to find tapes, photos, etc. The last major collection of tapes to be
found was in 1989, when Ksirodakasayi Dasa&rsquo;s collection of
about twenty-five audiocassettes was revealed to the Archives
devotees after they visited him in Vrndavana.</p>
<p>In June 2001 a collection of original
letters, black and white negatives, and some other items were donated
to the Bhaktivedanta Archives by Yamuna Devi Dasi and Dina-tarine
Devi Dasi. Also in 2001 a collection of seven photos of Srila
Prabhupada in Los Angeles was sent in by Nrsimhananda Dasa.</p>
<p><em>Operation Vani</em></p>
<p>Before the passing
of Srila Prabhupada, devotees had begun transcribing his recorded
lectures and conversations on a small scale. After the Mayapur
festival in 1978, Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami began compiling materials
for and writing a comprehensive biography of Srila Prabhupada, <I>Srila
Prabhupada Lilamrta</I>. It was then decided that the BBT would fund
the transcribing and proofreading of all Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s<I>
</I>tapes. This would meet two needs: providing material for the
<I>Lilamrta</I> and creating an archival record. It was then further
proposed to create a microfiche of these transcripts, a project named
Operation Vani. A massive typing and proofreading process took place
over more than four years, during which devotees typed 40,000 pages
of transcripts and finally photographed them onto microfiche.</p>
<p><em>Book publication</em></p>
<p>Operation
Vani ended in 1984. Transcription of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s tapes
continued, however, at a slower pace. In 1987 five volumes of Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s letters were published, and in late 1988 the
Bhaktivedanta Archives published the first volume of <I>Conversations
with Srila Prabhupada</I>. This was followed by various volumes of
lectures, such as <I>Collected Lectures on Bhagavad-gita As It Is</I>,
<I> Collected Lectures on Srimad-Bhagavatam</I>,
and <I>Collected Teachings</I>. Then came the publication of the <I>Back
To Godhead: 1944&ndash;1960&nbsp;The Pioneer Years, </I>the <I>Jaladuta</I>
<I>Diary </I>(Prabhupada&rsquo;s diary from his original journey to
the USA), and <I>The Beginning</I> (Prabhupada&rsquo;s 1966 New York
diaries). The Bhaktivedanta Archives also helped with the development
of mass distribution of BBT books, such as <I>Civilization and
Transcendence</I> and<I> The Laws of Nature</I>, which are in whole
or part edited from tape transcripts, and <I>Message of Godhead,</I>
an original hand-written manuscript.</p>
<p><em>DAT and the &lsquo;New&rsquo;
  Bhaktivedanta Tape Ministry</em></p>
<p>Around 1989 DAT
(digital audio tape) became the new standard for professionals in the
audio industry. The wonderful thing about the digital format is that
there is no loss of quality when a tape or image is copied. A
proposal was submitted to the BBT trustees to fund the transfer of
all the original reel-to-reel and cassette tapes to DAT. This was
begun around 1991 and continues to the present day. In 1996, with the
improvement and affordability of digital workstations, it was decided
to create the New Tape Ministry from tapes that had not been released
due to poor quality or recent acquisition. The new technology made
mastering the tapes much easier. The New Tape Ministry has 320 tapes,
bringing the Bhaktivedanta Tape Ministry total to over 1,000.</p>
<p><em>The CD Ministry</em></p>
<p>As soon as CDs came
out and it became affordable to print short runs, a donation from
Balabhadra Dasa from Scotland made possible the production of the
first three music CDs of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s <I>bhajanas</I> and
<I>kirtanas </I>(devotional music). This would soon be increased to
fourteen &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; music CDs. In 1998, with a
donation from Ambarisa Dasa, the first nine Vintage Series music CDs
were produced, and in 2000 the final eight CDs of the Vintage Series
were produced. In 1995 the CD lecture ministry was begun, and to date
102 CDs have been produced.</p>
<p><em>MP3</em></p>
<p>With the advent of
MP3 digital audio files, the tape ministry was converted to this
standard and distributed in a collection of 19 CDs in 2002.</p>
<p><em>The Bhaktivedanta VedaBase</em></p>
<p>In 1987, with the
advent of affordable and practical personal computers, efforts were
begun to input all the transcripts from Operation Vani. Adi-purana
Dasa, a devotee from New Zealand, performed a great austerity. While
living on yoghurt and Breyers ice cream, and residing in a devotee&rsquo;s
garage in Berkeley, Adi-purana would commute into downtown San
Francisco every day to a computer bureau, appropriately named Krishna
Copy. While he helped the owner, Sanjaya, Adi-purana would make use
of Sanjaya&rsquo;s Kurzweil scanner (then a $50,000 machine).
Single-handedly he scanned the 40,000 pages of transcripts, as well
as around fifty volumes of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>In late 1990
devotees from the Bhaktivedanta Archives were attending the annual
Comdex convention for the computer industry, looking for a computer
program that would become the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase, and, in a small
booth, they came across the Folio Corporation. Folio was by far the
best in the industry at the time, and has remained so even though the
company has been bought and sold a few times since then. In 1991,
Dulal Candra Dasa applied the necessary programming and the
Bhaktivedanta Electronic Library, running under DOS, was published.
In 1995, version 3.0 was released (now called the Bhaktivedanta
VedaBase and running under Windows and Macintosh) followed by version
4.11 in 1998. A new version is being prepared for release this year.
Each release has increased the number of works, as well as ease of
use. It has become a key project of the Bhaktivedanta Archives
because of its cataloguing and search functions.</p>
<p><em>The Bhaktivedanta VedaBase in Spanish</em></p>
<p>In cooperation with
the Spanish language division of the BBT, we have almost finished
compiling the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase in Spanish. It will contain all
the books by Srila Prabhupada that have been translated into Spanish,
as well as other Spanish BBT publications, such as cookbooks and
songbooks.</p>
<p><em>The Photo Archives</em></p>
<p>Until 1991, the
Photo Archives was still an active part of the production department
of the BBT in LA. It was then turned over to the Bhaktivedanta
Archives. When scanning technology developed and became affordable,
the scanning of 18,000 slides of Srila Prabhupada was undertaken for
cataloguing purposes. Then, in 1996, the North European BBT acquired
a high-quality drum scanner, and all the transparencies of the
artwork from their books were scanned at high resolution. In 1998,
1,700 of the best slides of Srila Prabhupada were scanned at high
resolution, and there are plans to scan more.</p>
<p><em>Document Scanning</em></p>
<p>In 2000, we began
the task of image scanning the documents and letters and plan to make
these scans part of a future upgrade of the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase.</p>
<p><em>The Matsya Project</em></p>
<p>The <I>sastras</I>
of India are fast disappearing. It has recently come to light that a
book by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti &micro;hakura has disappeared;
there are references to it, but no known copies exist. It is our hope
that we can transfer the <I>sastras</I> into digital format soon. We
have a microfiche collection of around 140,000 pages that need to be
input. There is another microfiche collection with American
University that has about 200,000 pages. Currently, to scan these
microfiches to disk will cost around $35,000. Then to set up a typing
and proofreading project to get these into the VedaBase will take
years, and current estimates of the cost of this are around $350,000.
There could scarcely be a more important project to Vaisnavas
and to Hindus in general than the preservation of this knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in the Bhaktivedanta
Archives?</strong></p>
<p>When archaeologists
investigate an ancient shipwreck, the first thing they look for is
the ship&rsquo;s inventory and cargo manifest. Why? Because they show
what to look for. They outline the supplies, the equipment, and the
cargo carried. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s books have a list
of books by the author and a list of ISKCON centres worldwide. It&rsquo;s
not just advertising, it&rsquo;s also a function of preservation.</p>
<p><em>The Bhaktivedanta Archives collection</em></p>
<p>Please
note that all the following figures, gathered this year, are
approximate due to ongoing acquisitions and updated cataloguing.</p>
<p>Please also note
that many items do not fit neatly into categories listed below, such
as a notebook that Srila Prabhupada wrote one or two lines in and
then discarded, or odd pieces of paper upon which he wrote one note,
like the first short list of names he was considering for the GBC.
The Bhaktivedanta Archives also maintains contact with devotees who
have collections of memorabilia, such as articles of clothing Srila
Prabhupada wore. There are also institutions like the Krsna-Balarama
temple in Vrndavana and Mayapur Chandrodaya temple, where Srila
Prabhupada&rsquo;s rooms are preserved.</p>

<p><B>Challenges the
Archives faces</B></p>
<p><em>The dark-ages</em></p>
<p>We need to be wary
of rosy scenarios that predict ever-increasing progress; there are
downturns in history. In our tradition we have a useful example in
the decline of Gaudiya Vaisnavism before the appearance of Srila
Bhaktivinoda &micro;hakura. In the West, there was a flowering of
knowledge during the Greek and Roman periods, but much of this
knowledge was later lost in the Dark Ages and rediscovered only
during the Renaissance. 
</p>
<p>The possibility of
such declines presents problems for the preservation of knowledge. In
the very long term, centuries and millennia ahead, there will be
considerable difficulty in preserving the teachings brought to the
West by Srila Prabhupada. We need to be aware of the existence of
&lsquo;dark-ages&rsquo; and thus formulate strategies to prevent the
disappearance of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>We also face the
problem of changing language. The language of Chaucer, a mere 600
years old, is mostly unintelligible to English speakers today.</p>
<p>We have to preserve
and translate, not just the original <I>s</I><I>astric
</I>languages, Sanskrit and Bengali, but also, as the language
evolves, the English commentaries. Not only will future scholars need
to learn Sanskrit and Bengali, they will also have to learn the
language of the purports &mdash; twentieth-century American English &mdash;
just as Buddhists and Jains learn Pali, the language of the time
Buddhism rose to prominence.</p>
<p><em>The mathematics of mythology</em></p>
<p>As surprising as it
may seem, one of our great challenges is to preserve the
understanding that Srila Prabhupada was a flesh-and-blood person;
that he really existed.</p>
<p>The ancient stories
of the Greek heroes and demigods are considered mythological. Many
Christian saints have been &lsquo;struck off the rolls&rsquo;, also
as mythological. There are even controversies about the identity of
Christ: some ask if he and John the Baptist were the same person and
the exact date of his birth is in doubt. As centuries pass, doubt
grows as to the very existence of great personalities. A 17<SUP>th</SUP>
century mathematician, John Craig, hypothesised in his work <I>Theologi&aelig;
Christian&aelig; Principia Mathematica</I> that &lsquo;the suspicions
against historical evidence increase with the square of time.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Because of this
danger of the mythologising of Srila Prabhupada, we at the
Bhaktivedanta Archives have begun compiling the chronology of his
writings and documenting accounts of the book production process. As
the first generations of Prabhupada&rsquo;s students this
responsibility is ours.</p>
<p><I>Obsolete
media</I></p>
<p>From the archival
point of view, the ability to digitise material and make it available
on CD or DVD is an invaluable tool for cataloguing and preservation.
However, it can also be dangerous to rely on such technologies
because they quickly become obsolete.</p>
<p>There is a very
instructive lesson in the experience of NASA. In the early years of
the space programme, their system was to record all raw data on
nine-track computer tapes. They would then take the data and extract
the information they needed and work with this. After some fifteen
years they needed to re-examine the original data. They had to search
worldwide for the last two nine-track computer tape machines that
existed at the time because these machines had become obsolete. If
they had not found these, they would have had to remanufacture a
nine-track computer tape machine from scratch.</p>
<p>Hard copies must always be kept and old
media transferred onto new media. This requires an ongoing effort if
we are not to lose valuable material.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for preservation</strong></p>
<p>Professor Thomas J.
Hopkins has pointed out that ISKCON has done well to establish the
Bhaktivedanta Archives and publish and preserve the works of Srila
Prabhupada in various media. He writes: &lsquo;We probably know more
about Prabhupada&rsquo;s life, works, and teachings than we do about
the founder of any other religious movement in history &mdash;
certainly more than we do about the Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, or even
Caitanya himself.&rsquo; (Hopkins, p. 1)</p>
<p>Archival
preservation usually means vaults with controlled temperature and
humidity. For example, the Mormons have dug a huge facility into a
mountain near Salt Lake City to store their genealogical records.</p>
<p>Butler,
Pennsylvania, was the first town in the Western world where Srila
Prabhupada lived. Also near Butler is an old limestone mine that has
been converted into underground storage vaults. It is here that the
original film of Srila Prabhupada, as well as video and DAT audio
tapes, are being stored. Many corporations, such as Westinghouse and
Universal Studios, keep their original movie footage, corporate
records, patents, and other documents here. Only a direct hit from a
thermonuclear device can destroy this facility. Duplicates of
archival material are also housed by the BBT divisions in Sweden and
Australia.</p>
<p>The
sankirtana strategy</p>
<p>ISKCON&rsquo;s main preaching function,
book distribution, dovetails well with preservation strategy. No
organisation emphasises book distribution like ISKCON. It is this
book production with translation into as many languages as possible,
and distribution to as many people as possible, that will be the most
potent force for the preservation of Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s
message.</p>
<p>Libraries are
another important element of the preservation strategy. Bear in mind
that when the library at Alexandria was burnt by Julius Caesar&rsquo;s
Roman troops around the middle of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> century BC and
finally demolished by the Christians around 400 AD, a large amount of
the Western world&rsquo;s knowledge was destroyed.</p>
<p>At the Bhaktivedanta Archives we want
to prevent something like this happening by making copies of
everything we have available to as many people as possible in as many
places as possible around the world. For this purpose we began the
Bhaktivedanta Library scheme so that the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase, as
well as sets of books, tapes, and videos, would be everywhere. Visnu
Murti Dasa, director of the Bhaktivedanta Library Services, began
this scheme more than ten years ago and has had some success. We hope
to increase this further.</p>
<p><em>Digitisation</em></p>
<p>At the Bhaktivedanta Archives we view
present technology as a window of opportunity. It will give us the
opportunity to catalogue and present all the Vaisnava literature and
history as we know it and distribute it worldwide within a very short
time. We then have to make sure that hard copies exist side by side
with the digital so that there is a backup. 
</p>
<p>Our main goal now is
to complete digitisation as soon as possible. We are purchasing
computers and scanners, as funds allow, so that we can scan all the
documents in the Bhaktivedanta Archives, from handwritten manuscripts
to typed transcripts to legal papers and so on. These can then be
incorporated into the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase to create a &lsquo;virtual
archive&rsquo;. This is not just material by Srila Prabhupada but
also about Srila Prabhupada, such as the <I>Memories of Srila
Prabhupada</I> video series that gives eyewitness accounts of the
events of his life. When one views the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo;
Bhaktivedanta Archives of the future, one will be able to search for
a particular phrase and access not just the text, but also photos,
video, audio recordings, and eye-witness accounts for the particular
time and place of that entry. These items will all be referenced to
the originals that exist in the Bhaktivedanta Archives.</p>
<p><em>Provenance</em></p>
<p>What is also
important for the future record is the history of how these materials
have been collected and preserved over the years. In the archival
world, this is called provenance and is examined very carefully by
academics and collectors. The importance of establishing the
provenance of archival materials cannot be overstated; hopefully this
article will contribute to that process.</p>
<p><I>Preserving
the originals</I></p>
<p>There are two
functions of any archive. The first is to make sure that original
materials are preserved unaltered. The second is to make sure that as
many people as possible know just what those originals are and where
to find them. The first function requires technology according to the
nature of the original; the second requires cataloguing and
publication.</p>
<p><em>Documents</em></p>
<p>Most modern paper
contains acids that cause the paper to self-destruct. Most newspapers
will not last seventy-five years; regular books may last a little
longer before they become brittle and finally crumble to dust. The
main preservation method is de-acidification. Individual papers are
sprayed with chemicals that neutralise the acids and leave an
alkaline buffer. Books are de-acidified by gassing them in a
high-pressure chamber. The document or book is then encapsulated in
Mylar for safety and handling. These documents and books are then
monitored regularly.</p>
<p><BR><I>Audio tapes</I></p>
<p>There is no method
of preserving audio tapes for long-term use, due to the nature of the
magnetic medium. Analogue copies of a tape will suffer approximately
5% loss of sound quality per generation. Digital tape is the best
copy method, but digital tapes are subject to the same deterioration
after twenty or so years. CD transfer results in a longer lifespan: 
current tests show that archival quality CDs are expected to last at
least 100 years in ideal conditions.</p>
<p>One of the greatest
losses to posterity is the tapes that Srila Prabhupada used to
dictate his translations and purports. Very early in the history of
ISKCON, Srila Prabhupada set up a system whereby Satsvarupa,
Hayagriva, and others would transcribe the recordings of his
translations and purports and then send the tapes back to him to be
re-used. There is one notable exception to this. There are 34
ninety-minute transcription tapes of <I>Krsna, The Supreme
Personality of Godhead.</I> This is due largely to the efforts of one
devotee, Dhrstaketu Dasa, who went through thousands of tapes to find
them.</p>
<p><B><BR></B>Another
loss is that only about 70 tapes survive from 1970. Why? One reason
is that the devotees there would listen to the recordings and then
re-use the same tape to record the next day&rsquo;s class. It seems
absurd now, but tapes were costly and the movement was not wealthy.</p>
<p><BR><I>Colour
film</I></p>
<p>Because the pigments in colour film
decay, the only way of preserving colour film beyond 40 or 50 years
is to freeze the film. This freezing process applies mainly to
slides, and special containers must be used. Great care has to be
taken when thawing out the slides. In addition, the refrigeration
units require constant power. Making film copies of film means loss
of quality. Digital transfer preserves at least the second-generation
quality, and transfer to the CD format should provide a 100-year
lifespan.</p>
<p><BR><I>Black-and-white
film</I></p>
<p>Black and white film will last over 100
years if properly stored. CD technology provides good backup storage
because the quality of the digital scans of black and white images is
much better than with colour, which involves far more variables.</p>
<p><em>Cataloguing the originals</em></p>
<p>The cataloguing of
thousands of pages of manuscripts, around 150,000 slides, negatives,
and original prints, thousands of hours of audio tape, and dozens of
hours of film and video requires great endeavour. All of these
materials need to be catalogued according to time and place; also,
records need to be kept of the source of the original (for example,
the name of the photographer or transcriber). Inevitably, problems
arise when this information is no longer available.</p>
<p>We have comprehensive catalogues of the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2,500 hours of audio, including
    references to the tape and CD ministries and book publications</li>
  <li>46 hours of film and video &mdash;
    scene-by-scene logs</li>
  <li>18,000 slides of Srila Prabhupada &mdash;
    place, year, and photographer, as well as a thumbnail computer
    catalogue</li>
  <li>ISKCON slides and negatives &mdash;
    some old catalogues for most of the collection</li>
  <li>Documents, letters,
    and manuscripts &mdash; catalogues and scanning in progress.</li>
  <li>Colour and
    black-and-white negatives &mdash; digital catalogues in progress</li>
  <li>Matsya fiche parts
    one and two</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of the next edition of
the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase in 2003, many of the image catalogues will
have been completed, and these will be included in this upgrade.</p>
<p><B><BR>Working
towards a living archive for ISKCON</B></p>
<p>Srila Prabhupada
once said that the society that he started, ISKCON, was non-different
from his body. Srila Prabhupada urged his followers to at least
maintain what he had established while encouraging them to expand.
There has been constant activity since the passing of Srila
Prabhupada: <I>harinama</I> parties, book distribution, temple
worship, the establishment of farm communities, large festivals, etc.
ISKCON needs to document these activities and keep a record for
future generations.</p>
<p>In his article &lsquo;Why Should ISKCON
Study Its Own History,&rsquo; Professor Thomas J. Hopkins points out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Numerous
    scholars outside ISKCON have studied its history, and some have done
    excellent work, however, non-devotees have neither the personal
    understanding nor the factual information to carry out a balanced
    study of ISKCON&rsquo;s institutional history. This task awaits
    devotees who have the historical training and the institutional
    support to carry out [...] a difficult and time-consuming job of
    collecting the world-wide data of ISKCON&rsquo;s expansion and
    evolution, [and] organising it systematically.... (Hopkins, p. 6)</p>
  <p>It
    is now more than 20 years since Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s death,
    however, and that is nearly two-thirds of ISKCON&rsquo;s total
    history to date. ISKCON has survived a very difficult stage in its
    development and is now healthier than it has been for many years. How
    has this happened? What went wrong in the past, and what responses
    were made that restored ISKCON&rsquo;s health? Without understanding
    these issues, it will be hard to preserve that healthy condition in
    the future. (Hopkins, p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Devotees need to be aware of the
importance of keeping records of their activities. 
</p>
<p>One effort is being
made by the Oxford Centre for Vaishnava and Hindu Studies (OCVHS) to
create an ISKCON archive. It consists of collections of newspaper
clippings and other items that have been assembled over the years.
Cataloguing is under way, and it is a significant start to this
process. There is also a proposal to create a VedaBase of the <I>Hare
Krishna World </I>newspaper and its predecessor, the <I>ISKCON World
Review</I>. These publications are very important in keeping a
running record of many of the achievements and activities of the
Society. All the articles from Back to Godhead magazine to date have
been included in the 2003 upgrade of the Bhaktivedanta VedaBase.</p>
<p>The Bhaktivedanta
Archives has tried to set a good example in recording the activities
of Srila Prabhupada and intends to collaborate fully with devotees in
their efforts to create a wider ISKCON archive that will perpetuate
Prabhupada&rsquo;s society and the efforts of his followers. At the
same time the Bhaktivedanta Archives has limited its preservation
activities to the &lsquo;Prabhupada era&rsquo; due to funding
constraints and the necessity to keep its focus.</p>
<p>In our
quarter-century of existence, the Bhaktivedanta Archives has been
blessed with some success due to the support of many devotees
throughout the world. We appeal to those interested to support the
activities of the Bhaktivedanta Archives and welcome any donations.
We pray that we will be blessed to carry on with this preservation
effort.</p>
