              <blockquote>
                <p><em>Care
                  within any society requires listening skills; skills that are not
                  always available when needed. In this article, the authors propose a
                  grass-roots system of peer-counselling as a way of helping
                  individuals to cope with life&rsquo;s problems. At the same time care
                  is taken to ensure that the principles of Vaisnavism
                  and peer counselling do not clash.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As the size and
diversity of the ISKCON population has increased since its inception
in the 1960s, the occurrence and reporting of psychosocial problems,
including child abuse, mistreatment and exploitation of women,
domestic disputes, substance abuse and addiction, and acute
psychological dysfunction, as well as corrective social and clinical
interventions, have increased concomitantly,
reflecting the mainstream cultures from which most of our
members are drawn. There is a need for the establishment of a
professionally qualified referral-based system of social workers and
counsellors within our society. This was poignantly expressed during
the conference, Therapy and Social Care: A Krsna
Conscious Perspective, held in Potomac, Maryland, on 1&ndash;2 June
2002. The conference was sponsored by ISKCON Communications, and led
to the establishment of the Vaisnava
Alliance of Care-providers (VAC). While the need for devotee access
to professional Krsna-conscious
counsellors appears indisputable, there is also interest in a
grassroots, continuously available, system of peer counselling that
would not require the direct presence of a trained clinician.
Simultaneously, professional supervision and referrals would remain
core elements of an effective community mental health system.</p>

<p>A grassroots system of peers could
include all devotees. Devotees would be encouraged to select one or
more peers from their local ISKCON community with whom they would
begin developing confidential relationships in accordance with
carefully-drawn ethical guidelines established for the protection of
the individual and the preservation of the system. Devotees would
choose peers with whom they do not currently have close
relationships. The choice of peer would be made on the basis of
similarities of age, service, goals, problems, qualifications, and
characteristics; therefore the peer would be ideally suited to
understand and offer support for the devotee&rsquo;s personal,
family, and social difficulties.</p>

<p>Intimate exchanges
undoubtedly occur between devotees already. However, because there
are no fundamental guidelines and ethical supervision, these
exchanges are not easily replicated, nor are they extended to all
devotees, since some devotees are not naturally inclined to engage in
intimate exchanges. Further, when especially challenging problems
occur, relationships may deteriorate because of lack of training,
feelings of being overwhelmed, or fears of stigma or &lsquo;contamination&rsquo;.
Greater facility can be provided by establishing ground rules, modest
organisational systems, and guiding ethical principles that promote
safety and encourage trust.</p>

<p>Importantly, a peer system must be
available without financial cost to the participants. While the need
for access to professional help is obvious, the costs of this help
may at times prove constraining. Many devotee professionals provide
care to devotee clients on a sliding scale or pro-bono basis, but
professional counsellors may be not be able to extend care in times
of expanding need, owing to economics or other factors.</p>

<p>The
co-counselling<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
model presented in this article provides ongoing care without cost,
other than the cost of materials, introductory training, and teacher
certification (these are not expensive). Each participant in the
co-counselling system takes a turn at being the counsellor for the
other within a scheduled session. This system of exchange and
reciprocity may prove to be the single most effective way of
disseminating principles of mental health throughout ISKCON
communities. Such reciprocity is achieved not by artificial mandate
but by the natural evolution of choice and practice, two components
that are already constituents of healthy <I>sadhana</I> (spiritual
practice). Through this gradual grassroots evolution, a culture of
confidentiality may be facilitated.</p>

<p><strong>Facilitating a culture of
confidentiality</strong></p>

<p>Most devotees regard
revealing one&rsquo;s mind in confidence and hearing in confidence as
established Vaisnava
social principles. In <I>The Nectar of Instruction </I>(v.
4), revealing one&rsquo;s
mind in confidence and hearing from another in confidence are given
as two of the six exchanges of love between devotees. Sometimes
devotees use this principle to explain or justify the idea of
counselling in devotee relationships. The confidential sharing of
&lsquo;problems&rsquo; and &lsquo;challenges&rsquo; to devotional
advancement is also part of the process for cleansing the heart.</p>

<p>Humanistic
psychology, specifically the work of Carl Rogers, emphasises the
importance of empathic or deep listening as perhaps the single most
critical element in providing effective counselling. In professional
counselling, when a client is deeply listened to without
interference, judgement, or too much advice, that client begins to
trust and reveal &mdash; to self and therapist &mdash; the thoughts,
feelings, behaviours, memories, and challenges that may need work or
are presenting as disturbances. For the listening to be effective,
the client must be able to count on the confidentiality of the
counsellor; that disclosures will be contained by the counsellor,
perhaps reflected back to the client, but with an attitude of
&lsquo;unconditional positive regard&rsquo;<A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
and safety.</p>

<p>However,
confidentiality must not be confused with secrecy. Problems such as
child abuse, spousal abuse, or any harm to self and/or others is
generally understood to be an exception to the rule and requires
either referral to a professional counsellor or reporting to an
authorised agency. In peer counselling we should seek ways to protect
and preserve confidentiality while also facing and dealing with
extreme situations quickly and compassionately.</p>

<p><strong>The power of listening and
confidentiality</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the broadest
rationale for devotees to deeply listen in confidence can be found in
the principle of <I>vaisnava-seva</I>:
serving the devotees. A strong service attitude rooted in
humility may allow one devotee to deeply listen to another devotee
for a prescribed amount of time, refraining from the urge to speak
unnecessarily or to give advice, and patiently facilitating whatever
the &lsquo;client&rsquo; devotee chooses to reveal. In the
co-counselling model, the participants switch roles, and the
listening exchange is reciprocated. In this model, one (counsellor)
devotee, out of love, chooses to listen, not speak, in order to
nurture the other (client) devotee. The client devotee receives this
gift and uses the process to discharge (cleanse) disturbances, or the
client devotee reveals joys that he or she is currently experiencing
in life.</p>

<p>During
our Masters-thesis research (Marks, Wright, Meader, and Bruce, 1994),
we conducted ethnographic field research in the Pacific-Northwest
United States with members of groups and subcultures who identified
themselves as &lsquo;skinheads&rsquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>.
In the process of collecting over seventy hours of videotaped
documentary footage, we encountered a considerable diversity of
people, settings, and, from mainstream society&rsquo;s point-of-view,
extreme belief systems and philosophies.</p>

<p>The core methodology
of the project pivoted on deep and careful listening. Time after time
we were told by the participants that they had never been listened to
before; one interviewee said, &lsquo;even my family and friends don&rsquo;t
know what you guys know&rsquo;. We received many similar testimonies.
Throughout the two-year project, the power and impact of deep,
layered listening was repeatedly confirmed and emphasised as the
essential element, and result, of the research. Researchers and
participants found the interactive deep listening process to be a
moving, life-changing experience. Modern life moves at a frenzied
pace, yet the simple and profound act of patient listening can
provide an effective and loving antidote to the passionate, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
have time&rsquo; mentality.</p>

<p>Much of the
suffering experienced by many individuals throughout their lives can
be attributed to the lack of opportunity to be properly heard. It is
the nature of this age that people are gradually torn apart from each
other and from intimacy by the struggle to survive. Regardless of
whether one is or is not insulated by the community of devotees, we
often come to relationships &mdash; any relationships &mdash; with a
deficit. Who has taken the time to listen to us? In the same way that
Caitanya Mahaprabhu not only instructed Sanatana Goswami but also
cured his sores, devotees have to listen and hear each other. Deep
listening is a cure for the inevitable emotional &lsquo;sores&rsquo;
symptomatic of an age of pain and sorrow.</p>

<p>To listen confidentially, we must first
address some of the challenges to confidentiality. A confidential
listener should be aware of dilemmas that surface in the
client-counsellor relationship and reflect on these with thought and
care for the individual who discloses private information. 
</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality dilemmas</strong></p>

<p>The
confidentiality dilemmas list below<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
can be used as a quick reference for possible challenges that are
raised by and within the confidential relationship. These issues
require careful thought before formulating a response in any given
situation. Before devotees disclose private information that could
create a dilemma for the listener, the client devotee should, if
possible, ascertain that the situation is safe and that the listener
will help contain the problem and protect the client devotee.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Legal</em></p>

<p>A
standard principle of the helping relationship is that the counsellor
must be alert to the potential for a distressed individual&rsquo;s
harming himself or others. A professional counsellor is legally
obliged to report such a possibility to the appropriate agency.
Peer counsellors may not always have an obligation to report or refer
an acutely distressed individual but they may have an ethical
responsibility to do so. The concerned peer counsellor should seek
help and support, ideally with the client&rsquo;s participation, from
another peer counsellor to obtain the level of professional care that
is needed. People often express feelings of hopelessness and
helplessness when they are discouraged; the decision to report this
information can put pressure on the counsellor. It is also true that
the interventions of social service protection agents can cause harm
and can lead to deterioration of an already difficult situation.
Therefore, great care should be given to the decision to breach
confidentiality and involve others. Nonetheless, sometimes this
choice is required. When a counsellor is not sure about the intention
of the client, it is important that he or she ask questions and try
to clarify whether or not the client already has a specific plan.</p>

<p><em>Organisational</em></p>

<p>When a devotee knows
that another devotee is suffering acutely from certain problems, what
obligation is there to report this to managers in the organisation,
especially those who directly supervise the client or that the client
directly supervises? How will this kind of information, when
disclosed to a manager, affect the position and service of the
devotee experiencing difficulty? In order for confidentiality to
work, the disclosure of a devotee&rsquo;s problems must remain the
burden of the devotee experiencing those problems. A culture of
confidentiality cannot be created in an atmosphere wherein devotees
receive private disclosures and then needlessly report this
information to other devotees.</p>

<p><em>Philosophical and moral</em></p>

<p>The path of Krsna
consciousness has specific guidelines regarding chanting, following
regulative principles, and proper association with devotees. Devotees
who hear each others&rsquo; problems may feel the inclination to
judge; they may fear losing their own tenuous hold on their <I>sadhana</I>
and devotional principles; or they may feel it is necessary to
&lsquo;preach&rsquo; to the devotee disclosing the problem instead of
listening. The way out of these feelings is to disclose our
judgements and fears in our own sessions, to continue to practice
<I>sadhana</I> carefully, and to continue to practice deep listening
&mdash; wherein we will again and again have opportunities to hear
how devotees overcome their problems each day in practising Krsna
consciousness. Since Krsna consciousness is a process, it is the job
of the society of devotees to facilitate that process in each and
every devotee with caring and humility: this is the goal of authentic
listening.</p>

<p><em>Spiritual</em></p>

<p>Sometimes a devotee reveals information
that appears to indicate that his or her relationship with the
spiritual master, Krsna,
or the society of devotees is in jeopardy. These relationships are
the responsibility of the individual, not the counsellor/listener.
Taking guidance from the concept of serving the servant, the
listener&rsquo;s job in the client-counsellor relationship is to
serve the client. 
</p>

<p><em>Family and friends</em></p>

<p>All human beings
live within some context of family and friends. Sometimes, in a close
society of devotees, a client-counsellor relationship may develop
between people who know each other&rsquo;s family, friends, gurus,
and disciples. Care must be taken to prevent these other
relationships from compromising effective listening. We should always
try to bring ourselves back to listening with empathy, and we should
utilise our own opportunities for disclosure to reconcile our
distress or problems. In the case of an acute problem that a client
may have and that may have an impact upon the client&rsquo;s friends
or family, the best thing is for the client to work through the
problem to the point where he or she can disclose this to the family.
If there is a significant concern on the part of the counsellor, a
referral to a trained clinician can be arranged, provided the client
concurs. 
</p>

<p><em>Personal</em></p>

<p>We have the
potential for changing each other&rsquo;s lives and for facilitating
deeper, more congruent <I>sadhana</I> and devotional service. In the
client-counsellor relationship, we must protect the sacredness of the
exchange by not allowing the relationship to develop in other ways;
for example, the client and counsellor should not simply &lsquo;hang
out&rsquo; together or pursue a romantic relationship with each
other. We should not seek a surrogate guru-disciple relationship in
the counsellor-client relationship. 
</p>

<p>The key to
confidentiality is not only remembering to hold a person&rsquo;s
disclosure as private but also, perhaps more importantly, to maintain
the sacredness of the relationship that facilitates that disclosure.
The relationship between the two devotees, who take turns as client
and counsellor, disclosing and listening, becomes a temple for
service to each other. Co-counselling relationships are sought
outside and remain outside our social network to protect their
sacredness. If we hear a devotee disclosing information in public
that we heard her or him share in a one-to-one session, this doesn&rsquo;t
automatically give us the right to discuss the specific information
disclosed to us with other devotees. If we see a devotee with whom we
have shared a co-counselling relationship, we don&rsquo;t advertise
this to others but instead behave discreetly. While the telling of
devotees&rsquo; stories is an often inspiring part of devotee
association, we should first emphasise our own personal disclosure;
and secondly, only with the permission of other devotees, should we
tell their stories.</p>

<p><strong>What is re-evaluation counselling?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Re-evaluation of a person&rsquo;s
    rigid patterns of behavior seems to consist primarily of his
    exploring these patterns with part of his attention, while at the
    same time managing with part of his attention to stay outside the
    pattern and achieving some kind of objective look at them.</p>
  <p>	This
    division of attention, this <I>balancing</I> of <I>attention between</I>
    the <I>content</I> of the <I>reactive pattern</I> or the experience
    of <I>hurt</I> and the <I>real world of the present</I>, seems to be
    necessary at every level of this process. It is present in the
    discharge of deep grief, it is present at every level up through the
    &lsquo;talking out&rsquo; of boredom. (<I>Fundamentals,</I> p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The psychological theory behind
re-evaluation counselling (RC) conceives of human beings as intact
individuals at birth. Individuals start life unscarred by personal
trauma; they inherently possess full intelligence, creative capacity,
and a natural joyfulness and &lsquo;zest&rsquo; for living. &lsquo;Vast
intelligence, zestful enjoyment of living, co-operative relationships
with others &mdash; these seem to constitute the essential human
nature&rsquo;. (Jackins, p. 28) 
</p>

<p>Young children are intrinsically able
to heal hurts by instinctive emotive discharge around painful events
by, for example, crying, shaking, and trembling. This natural ability
of the child to heal by discharge in immediate and direct relation to
the traumatic event preserves the intelligence, creativity, and
healthfulness of the person and prevents the layering of stored
traumatic material and reduced capacity found in the incapacitated
adult. 
</p>

<p>Vedic teachings
provide a picture of the original nature of the soul as inherently
and eternally full of knowledge and bliss. Then, due to association
with matter and material conditioning, the soul becomes covered by
the subtle and gross bodies and bound by the false ego (<I>ahankara</I>).
This conditioning imprints traumatic material on the subtle body&rsquo;s
record as memories, conscious and subconscious. These imprints cover
the true nature of the soul and eclipse its constitutional position
as an eternal servant of the Lord.</p>

<p>We can infer the complexities from our
past lives by analysing our current life. 
</p>

<p>It is to our
advantage to use whatever tools are available for removing blockages
and obstacles that are inhibiting our progress in devotional life.
Inhibitions that we can understand are not only traceable to
traumatic events from our current lives but are also likely to evince
patterns and problems linking us to karmic ties from previous
entanglement.</p>

<p><strong>How does RC work?</strong></p>

<p>RC is a co-counselling process for
talking about current and past experiences and emotionally
discharging them within a safe and confidential relationship. 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Co-counselling
    is a sort of a mutual &lsquo;take-turns&rsquo; bootstrapping process.
    You can&rsquo;t lift yourself by your own bootstraps but you can take
    turns lifting each other. It works, and of course it works in larger
    groups than two, but for the economy of time, most Co-counselling is
    done in pairs, switching roles, between the first person who is
    listened to and the second, who listens. That&rsquo;s about what it
    amounts to.<BR>
    (<I>Fundamentals,</I> p. 51)</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Deep listening</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing you must do and do very
    well is to listen ... listen with interest, with full attention.</p>
  <p>	If you will listen in this manner,
    your client will be encouraged and enabled to talk about himself,
    about his patterns of distress. He may relate them to you in terms of
    difficulties or he may relate them as experiences that occurred.</p>
  <p>Many light tensions seem able to be
    unravelled because your client is enabled to think about them much
    more thoroughly if he or she can talk about them to an interested
    listener.&rsquo; </p>
  <p>(<I>Fundamentals,</I> p. 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening cannot be underestimated.
Non-interfering, deep listening over time is one of the most
empowering and compassionate behaviours a devotee (or anyone) can
demonstrate. Listening in a co-counselling relationship does not mean
giving advice, disclosing one&rsquo;s similar problems, or pursuing
avenues of interest or inquiry that reflect the counsellor&rsquo;s
agenda. The client knows where to go if the counsellor will only
listen and be observant for and attentive toward discharge moments.</p>

<p><em>Emotional discharge</em></p>

<p>&lsquo;Discharge is
the recovery process from irrationality, from distress&rsquo;.
(<I>Fundamentals,</I> p. 43) In RC theory, old and new hurts, fears,
joys, angers, and frustrations can be re-stimulated and discharged
and thereby prevented from hardening into introjected distortions and
burdens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Now,
    if Mother is as we have hypothesized &mdash; relaxed, aware,
    attentive, and undistressed &mdash; if she gives to the baby her
    aware attention and concern, gives him her arms and eyes but <I>keeps
      her mouth shut</I> and does not talk, sympathize, jiggle, distract or
    interfere, then the damage repair process of the baby goes into
    action. Without hesitation, spontaneously (no one has to tell the
    baby what to do) he turns to this attentive mother and begins to cry.
    Allowed to do so, he cries and cries and cries and cries. He will
    continue to do so for a long, long time if every time he slows down
    and looks out at this mother he finds her still interested, still
    attentive, still caring, but not interfering or distracting. 
  (Jackins, p. 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During a co-counselling session, the
counsellor needs to stay focused and tuned to the client&rsquo;s
emotional process. When a client begins to express or discharge
certain memories or experiences, the counsellor facilitates the
remembrance and re-evaluation of hurts or traumas within a safe and
supportive relationship. Helping the client stay on track in a
non-interfering way means helping the client stay with the emotional
process that was thwarted or prematurely blocked in the past.
Discharging these obstructions will return previously constricted
capacity to the use of the client. It may take several sessions for a
client to revisit, re-evaluate, and reclaim the original wholeness
that existed before it was eclipsed by the traumatic event. 
</p>

<p>Note that Jackins
states that when &lsquo;allowed to do so, he cries and cries and
cries and cries&rsquo;. New counsellors must grow accustomed to and
become comfortable with the emotional discharge of their clients.
Sometimes the counsellor may be afraid that the client&rsquo;s
discharge is too intense or could become counter-productive. The
counsellor must have faith that only through a completion of
previously restricted emotional discharge can the client be freed
from residual pain that inhibits them in their present lives. 
</p>

<p><em>Working through</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>	How can you be a successful counselor
    and always help your client achieve discharge? We can now state a
    three-step rule for successful counseling .... Step one, pay enough
    attention to the client to see what his or her distresses are. This
    includes, of course, asking them and listening to them, as well as
    observing them. Step two is to think [...] how those distresses can
    be contradicted. Step three is to contradict them sufficiently. If
    you do these three things, discharge will always come.<br>
    (<I>Fundamentals,</I>
p. 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contradiction in
co-counselling means to contradict the original interference that
prevented the client from going through a natural emotional discharge
at the time of the original emotional event. Contradiction is a
supportive, responsive, listening tactic that helps the client stay
on track and supports them in their need to break through the
original interference. For example, if an employer shuts down an
employee&rsquo;s attempts to advance or contribute more creatively at
work and this was done in a shaming, dominating manner that left the
employee feeling pain and frustration, the counsellor might
contradict this interference during the client&rsquo;s emotional
discharge in order that the client feel free to express her or his
anger, feelings of oppression, or frustration at having her or his
creative urge denied.</p>

<p>Careful listening
tracks idiosyncratic expression. When the client is speaking and gets
to the real distress, the counsellor may repeat or state something
that is idiosyncratic but helps the client to discharge. Being tuned
to the client&rsquo;s process includes observing the client&rsquo;s
body language. The counsellor can sense emotions building as the
client begins to cry or her or his words become choked. The client
may become angry or passionate about what she or he is saying. If the
counsellor grabs onto something key or elemental to what is being
said, then the counsellor can assist in deepening the discharge
process. It begins by watching and following. If the counsellor is
wrong, he or she can back off and try to get back to where the
emotions dropped off. To move past emotional discharge opportunities
is interfering and evasive.</p>

<p>In working through
distresses, it is important for the client not to prematurely close
the issue; too short a session may be problematic. In the early days
of co-counselling, half-hour sessions were typical, but 45 minutes to
an hour may be more productive. In solidly working through
discharging of distresses, the client has sufficient time to scan the
memories and thoughts and try to describe parts of the experience
that were missed during the first, second, or third recounting.
However, as the relationship develops, quick sessions may become
appropriate for both participants, but the sessions must be mutually
satisfying.</p>

<p>If thorough and sufficient discharging
occurs, a person naturally re-establishes a sense of personal
congruence and feels grounded after leaving a session. However, if
there are times that the emotive process escalates beyond what feels
safe and in the best interests of the client to be able to return to
the outside world, the counsellor may need to help the client feel
more grounded with some &lsquo;here and now&rsquo; techniques.</p>

<p><B>Some
frequently asked questions about RC</B></p>

<p>Although
we (the authors) have been involved in RC since the early 1990s, we
were recently re-introduced to it and have had time to digest some of
the literature as well as participate in new introductory sessions.
We brought some of our questions to our teacher in order to better
address issues we found to be challenging. What follows is our
understanding of the RC perspective on these issues based on her
answers.</p>

<p><I>Do
you try to stick to the amount of time allotted for the session? If
someone is discharging heavily and seems to be making good progress,
do you just stop? Do you ever find that some kind of de-escalation or
re-grounding is necessary to help someone put their &lsquo;game face&rsquo;
back on?</I></p>

<p>Co-counsellors
generally meet and share an equivalent amount of time, for example 50
minutes to one hour each, taking turns as client and counsellor.
Occasionally, someone will get a session as a client and then later
provide time as a counsellor as their partner chooses. At the end of
a session, a question might be asked that assists the client in
grounding back to the present. This is called a &lsquo;present-time&rsquo;
question. For example: &lsquo;what do you plan to do this weekend?&rsquo;
or &lsquo;tell me what you like to do in your spare time?&rsquo; 
</p>

<p><I>The
notion that RC should not be mixed with other theories makes good
sense, but how does this
apply in religious communities or other
organisations that have pre-existing governance.</I></p>

<p>RC
has been successful by staying true to its principles and being
careful not to dilute its practices in order to accommodate different
groups and settings. Co-counsellors will learn best how to co-counsel
by being part of the larger co-counsellor community. People in
particular groups or organisations should consider going out from
their own organisations to build relationships in the RC community in
order to bring back effective co-counselling skills and understanding
of RC theory to their own groups.</p>

<p><I>We
understand and agree with the idea that persons within a
co-counselling relationship should not socialise with each other
outside of that relationship. However, close friends and family who
end up in co-counselling (not necessarily with each other) can&rsquo;t
help but infect each other within their overlapping relationships.</I></p>

<p>One
of the great benefits of co-counselling is that we do not use our
counsellor or our client as our friend. This means that the
relationship is reserved for co-counselling only. The counselling
relationship utilises discharge, which
often requires repetition of traumatic events. Discharge is a means
of reliving and releasing the residue of traumatic events, which
block one from as full and free a life as possible. By doing this
work with your counsellor, you can avoid burdening your friendships
with counselling needs. Already existing friendships and
relationships that later include co-counselling experiences and
skills can only benefit those relationships.</p>

<p><I>We
are sensitive about concerns regarding psychiatric drug usage.
However, we&rsquo;ve seen cases where people who already have deep
problems couldn&rsquo;t function at all without these drugs. Would RC
theory strictly require these people to go off medication before
being involved in co-counselling? This is an issue of concern as
oppression could occur either way. We envision a transition, if
possible.</I></p>

<p>RC
is not for everyone. Some people believe that psychotropic medication
blocks effective discharge from happening and certainly there is a
prohibition against mood-altering drugs and alcohol before sessions.
It seems that the wider RC community is
continuing to work through their position on this issue. Being part
of an RC community means getting involved with the process of
establishing and revising RC policies. One who, for any reason, is
incapable of focusing on and maintaining the shared relationship of
client and counsellor will probably not be able to make it in RC.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing co-counselling training</strong></p>
<p>Introductory and educational classes
for RC are available internationally. RC communities exist in over
eighty countries. Since 1994, several million people have
participated, and there are many books, journals, pamphlets and other
educational materials. A &lsquo;Fundamentals&rsquo; class lasts over
six weeks and is reasonably priced.</p>

<p>The RC community
actively seeks to involve and train new members and believes its
mission to be the promotion of world peace and harmony through
practicing the principles of co-counselling. 
</p>

<p><B>A proposed code
of ethics for co-counselling in a K</B><B>rs</B><B>na
conscious community </B>
</p>

<p>Devotees can obtain
RC teaching certification and begin to offer the process within their
devotional communities. In this way, devotees will naturally adapt
the styles and system to work within Krsna
conscious culture. While practitioners of RC believe in preserving
the integrity of RC&rsquo;s organisation and methodology by not
mixing it with other theories and practices, there are, in our
analysis, no glaring conflicts between co-counselling practice and
devotional practice. It appears to us that devotees could be
co-counsellors <I>and</I> devotees without infringing upon either
philosophy or practice.</p>

<p>We would suggest the following as an
ethical basis for a Krsna
conscious peer-counselling model.</p>

<p><em>Confidentiality</em></p>

<p>The
confidentiality of the individual is a priority. If even one person&rsquo;s
safety, trust, and integrity are broken, the entire culture is
compromised. Gossip or casual
conversation that breaches confidentiality is harmful. However,
relying on secrecy as a means of avoiding the reporting of abuse and
harm is not to be mistaken with confidentiality. When in doubt,
obtain the confidential support of a more experienced counsellor.</p>

<p><em>Balance</em></p>

<p>There is a need to
respect the devotional maturation process of each individual while
sustaining and preserving the purity of Vaisnava standards and
teachings.</p>

<p><em>Children</em></p>

<p>Recognise and
prioritise the importance of children so that the individual and the
community acknowledge the innate vulnerability of children and take
responsibility for their protection.</p>

<p><em>Equality</em></p>

<p>To see with &lsquo;equal
vision&rsquo; (<I>Bhagavad-gita</I> 5.18) also requires respect for
and ownership of the individual&rsquo;s ethnicity, cultural-identity,
gender, race, age, and physical ability.</p>

<p><em>Free Access</em></p>

<p>Co-counselling is free of charge. No
one should seek to undermine its availability by attaching financial
reward or restriction to its use or dissemination.</p>
<p><B>Counselling
principles as a priority in ISKCON</B></p>

<p>Satsvarupa Dasa
Goswami writes in <I>Among Friends</I>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ISKCON,
    with all thy faults, I love thee. Yes this institution has to be
    reformed, but it will begin with the reformation of each member&rsquo;s
    heart and with their not denying their own responsibility both for
    themselves and their duty toward Prabhupada&rsquo;s movement.
    (Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, p.
    9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truthfulness is very
important. We need the truthful realisation that we are not these
bodies, together with their material identifications and false
attachments. We need the truthful realisation that we are eternal
loving servants of the Lord and His devotees. We also need the
truthful realisation that begins with our &lsquo;own responsibility&rsquo;
for ourselves, and moves outward to encompass and include our family
and social relationships.</p>

<p>Carefully
and caringly practicing devotional relationships cannot be assumed as
a given. These exchanges require skills, etiquette, and a deepening
trust. Developing deep trust in relationships is challenging for all
people regardless of society and culture. Without a culture of
confidentiality as a natural practice, truthful disclosure may not be
met with reciprocal safety and caring containment. Our disclosure may
become public information, gossip, or rumour. We may be censured or
our service and careers be threatened or taken away. This goes for
every level of devotee in every <I>asrama </I>(stage of life) and may
even be life-threatening. When we lose our service we lose the very
lifeline that connects us to our worship of Krsna, we lose the active
process that links us to our guru, and we lose the daily activity
through which we interact with other devotees.</p>

<p>We
cannot afford to lose our service. And we cannot afford to evade
self-disclosure and truthfulness in our relationships. 
</p>

<p>Truthfulness
is an interactive, relational practice that takes place within the
safety and confidentiality of mature relationships. Within this
relational containment, disclosure can occur, and, through deep
listening, patient progress without the loss of service and regard
can be sustained. Through effective peer counselling with a service
attitude, we facilitate each other in a cleansing process and help to
establish a viable environment for healthy relationships. 
</p>

<p>Facilitating
strong and caring relationships that lead to long-term consistency
and preservation of progress furthers the spiritual, holistic health
of the individual and the organisation. Co-counselling is a tool for
self-care and the care of others. Relationships constructed on
fundamentals of trust and support provide a means to face the
struggles and obstacles that are a natural by-product of
purification. Peer counselling offers a safety-net to protect our
most valuable resource &mdash; each other &mdash; and can be
established as a priority in our day-to-day lives until, one day, the
intimate, safe, and loving exchange of problems and accomplishments
between people becomes an ordinary and natural process of life.</p>
