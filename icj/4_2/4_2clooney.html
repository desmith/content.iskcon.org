              S.J.</a> 
            <p>Nineteen people (ten Vaishnavas and nine Christian) participated 
              in this conference at the Cathedral Conference Centre in southern 
              Massachusetts. The Centre, on the shore of a very beautiful lake, 
              provided a quiet and contemplative setting for what proved to be 
              a busy, but rewarding, weekend from Friday night until late Sunday 
              afternoon. 
            <p align=LEFT>Several features distinguished the meeting as a rich 
              and complex event. It cer- tainly offered challenging opportunities 
              for scholarly discussion due to the fine opening papers by Klaus 
              Klostermeier and Tamal Krishna Goswami on the conference theme, 
              "The Destiny of the Soul". Dr. Klostermeier presented the Christian 
              perspective, touching upon a wide range of materials, diverse in 
              period and genre: Biblical sources; theological perspectives in 
              the early Church and Middle Ages, with special attention to the 
              De Anima of Thomas Aquinas; "medieval visions of soul and God" in 
              mystics such as Elsbeth Stagel and Angela da Foligno; challenges 
              from modern thinkers (such as Darwin, Freud, Jung); and, by way 
              of a single example, the writing of the German theologian Michael 
              Schinaus, an illustration of contemporary theological reflection. 
              His presentation concluded with synthetic reflections on the great 
              mass of material introduced only in the barest sketch, and with 
              an important plea to both Vaishnavas and Christians to rethink their 
              traditional teachings in the light of the contemporary sciences 
              without abandoning their timeless insights. Hearing this challenge, 
              we were reminded to pursue our discussions with a sense of contemporary 
              issues-a concern we came to share more vividly as the conference 
              progressed. 
            <p align=LEFT>Tamal Krishna Goswami focused his presentation thematically 
              rather than his- torically, focusing on three key aspects of the 
              Vaishnava representation of the soul's destiny with God: consciousness 
              (<i>sambandha</i>), salvation (<i>abhidheya</i>), and the kingdom 
              of God (<i>prayojana</i>). He thereby gave us a strong sense of 
              the role of human responsibility with regard to this destiny, and 
              the journey there-with the help of the guru, the community of believers 
              and scripture; and his vivid presentation gave us many images of 
              the abodes to which devotees may rise after death. Listeners seemed 
              particularly impressed by the latter images, and the Christians 
              among us immediately began to explore whether and how this imagery 
              is accessible to people raised in the Biblical traditions. 
            <p align=LEFT>The meeting was skilfully planned, so as to be able 
              to move forward at a reflective pace. As soon at the presentations 
              were done and we turned to a shared consideration of them, we also 
              began to ask how we wanted to structure our time and address the 
              many issues placed before us. The group interacted very well, and 
              there was no inclination to separate into smaller groups of Vaishnavas 
              and Christians. Despite the differences in background and occupation 
              among us, we worked well together, and found numerous meeting points 
              where our conversation could begin. 
            <p align=LEFT>It was clear to us, without much being said on the topic, 
              that this was not the time nor place to pursue the truly scholarly 
              agenda placed before us by the papers; at best, we could provide 
              some inspiration and direction for that kind of research during 
              this weekend. Eventually, we identified five areas that we felt 
              we could talk about more or less immediately. 
            <p>First, there were the metaphysical and epistemological aspects 
              of the question of the soul's destiny, such as might be considered 
              by a systematic theologian. While we implicitly agreed that they 
              were too complex for this group, on this weekend, we seemed to acknowledge 
              them as setting a realistic frame and set of boundaries for our 
              discussions. 
            <p>A second area highlighted linguistic issues. While these too had 
              very technical angles, we had more success in opening some of these 
              up as immediately perti- nent-e.g., the delicate balance between 
              "real" and "metaphorical" descriptions of religious realities, the 
              tensions believers have in balancing a commitment to a faith language 
              that expresses things as they really are, with a recognition of 
              the manifold ways in which any human language can only indirectly 
              and more fluidly express what we-as communities, as individuals-really 
              mean and care about. 
            <p>Our third and fourth areas of consideration focused respectively 
              on the social relevance and spiritual importance of beliefs about 
              the soul's destiny. How does it matter, here and now in today's 
              world, whether Christians or Vaishnavas think one way or another 
              about what happens after death? Do these apprehensions of life after 
              death distract us from this-worldly obligations which should take 
              precedence? Spiritual concerns matter too, in a different way: How 
              do our communities actually find strength in what they say about 
              the ultimate, liberated life after death? How do our discourses 
              about the destiny of the soul help us to live and grow spiritually, 
              now? 
            <p>As our fifth area, we introduced a range of issues related to sin 
              and death. Although both our traditions recognise the reality and 
              weight of sin, we seemed to find it easier and more urgent to discuss 
              our attitudes toward death: How do our understandings of life after 
              death affect the way we deal with tragic accidents, painful diseases, 
              and even the sense we have of our own finitude? 
            <p>These issues were thus inviting us into more personal reflections 
              on why we as individuals find it important to think, imagine and 
              speak in certain ways about life af- ter death. During increasingly 
              personal discussions, we began to share a little more deeply, by 
              sharing our individual views of how views of the destiny of the 
              soul shape our lives now: What kinds of hopes, expectations, desires 
              (in small or large ways) characterise how we act from day to day, 
              strengthened by hope about what is beyond the grave? A number of 
              us even took this opportunity to speak "from the beginning", telling 
              our life stories of search, faith, conversion. As one participant 
              observed, to hear these stories was itself a blessed moment, testimony 
              to the power of faith. 
            <p>In light of the preceding developments, it was proven to be especially 
              wise that the planners understood how theological dialogue cannot 
              proceed fruitfully without the participants also drawing on the 
              communal and personal religious resources of their traditions. The 
              schedule therefore included four periods for shared worship, each 
              morning in the Christian tradition and each afternoon in the Vaishnava 
              tradition. These opportunities marked the wholeness of the meeting: 
              what was read, thought, said, shared, was always meant to be rooted, 
              as best we could, in the realities of religious commitment. 
            <p>By the end of Sunday afternoon, we realised that we were still 
              only at the beginning of this interaction of the Hindu and Christian 
              traditions here in the West. To explore further our many shared 
              interests and values, and to face up more directly to the things 
              that distinguish and divide us, we need to proceed on all four levels 
              addressed at the meeting: 
            <p>We need to foster philosophical and theological enquiries by which 
              members of both traditions come to understand the systems of belief, 
              and then compare and contrast them on a technical basis. 
            <p>We need to keep talking in a creative fashion in order to find 
              a common ground and to understand the ways in which our beliefs 
              matter to us; how we are more or less successful in putting what 
              we believe into words that others can understand. 
            <p>We need to keep sharing our personal stories, for it is these that 
              give flesh and blood reality, today, to our traditions and to our 
              contemporary encounters. 
            <p>And we need to keep praying and worshipping together, respectfully 
              inviting one another into the depths of our traditions. 
            <p>We can start anywhere, but as communities we must move forward 
              on all these levels. Do we really have a common destiny? None of 
              us wanted to take this merely for granted, but we all seemed to 
              thrill to God's grace running through us when we prayed and sang 
              together: 
            <ul>
              <p>"When we've been there ten thousand years,<br>
                Bright shining as the sun, <br>
                We've no less days to sing God's praise <br>
                Than when we'd first begun." 
            </ul>
