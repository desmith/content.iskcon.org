              </b>NB. The footnotes for this article are linked to a separate 
              <a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html">footnote</a> page. 
            <p><b>Preface/Postscript<br>
              </b>I deeply appreciated the invitation from Shaunaka Rishi and 
              Anuttama Dasa to prepare the Christian position paper for this conference, 
              and I enjoyed the warm atmosphere created by our friendly hosts. 
              When preparing my manuscript I was naturally aware of significant 
              doctrinal differences between not only the various branches of Christendom, 
              but also between traditional and progressive thinkers in one and 
              the same denomination. I intended to give a summary of what I thought 
              was mainstream traditional Christian teaching on the soul and its 
              destiny, beginning with a study of some Biblical notions relating 
              to soul, giving an outline of Thomas Aquinas' and mediaeval official 
              Church teaching, providing some mystical-experiential accounts, 
              summarising a major contemporary Roman Catholic theologian's view 
              on the "destiny of the soul", mentioning some major modern challenges 
              to Christian views of the soul and ending with a few personal/critical 
              remarks on the issue. 
            <p align=LEFT>I came away from the meeting with the impression that 
              there is not a single statement regarding the nature and destiny 
              of the soul that would be accepted by all Christian denominations. 
              The doctrinal development in the various Christian denominations, 
              and the disinterest shown by many contemporary Christians in any 
              formulations of "metaphysical doctrines" has reached a point where 
              it is pretty meaningless to speak of a "Christian position" on questions 
              like the soul and its destiny vis-a-vis e.g., a Vaishnava position. 
              It would be possible-as was suggested by one participant-to compare 
              and contrast the teaching on soul of, for instance, Thomas Aquinas 
              and Jiva Goswami; however, it was widely felt that such a comparison 
              would be rather useless. The emphasis, all were agreed, should be 
              on contemporary perceptions, and a perceived relevance to the questions 
              of our age and day. 
            <p align=LEFT>The following write-up does not claim to reflect the 
              collective thinking on the soul and its destiny of the individual 
              Christians present at the gathering (none of whom came in any official 
              function), but is offered as a historic document and as a point 
              of departure for the discussion which proved to be lively as well 
              as going in many different directions. 
            <p><b>Biblical Background<br>
              </b>Since this paper is meant to prepare a dialogue with Vaishnavism, 
              the horizon of the "soul-dialogue" must encompass not only Western 
              philosophical and theological Christian <i>psyche</i> notions, but 
              must cover all notions contained in the Indian notion of <i>jivatman.</i> 
              Accordingly, the Biblical background will include notions of "life" 
              and "spirit" over and above "soul". 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Life</b> (Hebrew <i>chaim </i>; Greek <i>zoe</i>; 
              Latin: <i>vita</i>) is one of the most fundamental concepts of the 
              Bible. "The living God" is a standing expression, as compared with 
              the "dead idols".<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#1">1</a> God 
              is "life-giving-spirit", and life is the most precious possession 
              of man. Life is not seen only in terms of modern medicine and biology, 
              as a mere physico-chemical mechanism, but it is the whole of existence, 
              feeling, thinking, knowing God. Life is something divine-only God 
              can give it. Genesis relates that humans got their life through 
              a special and immediate act of God. Life in the proper sense is 
              union with God; the sinner is "dead", even if biological life is 
              still going on. Life is thus the most cherished treasure of humans, 
              identical with God's blessing, merit, good-whereas death is synonymous 
              with sin, God's curse, evil. Since sin has deprived humans of their 
              true life-the union with God-the purpose of salvation is to restore 
              the life. Christ calls himself "life". <a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              God is life, and can give life. "Life" is the state of the redeemed 
              ones, a life which is the fruit of the redemption through Christ, 
              which will last forever. "Eternal life" is not something which comes 
              "after death", but it is the divine life, which is already in those 
              who have received salvation. Life is essentially seen as a process 
              of communication, whose source is "the living God". The conditions 
              to receive it are faith in Christ,<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#3"> 
              3</a> good works, love of neighbour especially,<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#4">4</a> 
              baptism and Eucharist.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#5">5</a> 
              Baptism is described as the "dying with Christ and rising with Christ 
              to a new life in God".<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#6">6</a> 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Soul</b> (Latin: <i>anima</i>) is the translation 
              of the Biblical nephesh and psyche, and etymologically both contain 
              the idea of breath, blowing, drawing breath. Sometimes psyche is 
              used simply as a synonym for life, or the principle of life,<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#7">7 
              </a>or for "living being"-either animal or man;<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#8">8</a> 
              in other places it means the principle which is opposed to the body,<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#9">9</a> 
              which is immortal and which is man's most valuable "part": "What 
              does it profit you if you gain the whole world and lose your soul? 
              What can you give in exchange for your soul?"<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#10"> 
              10</a> And: "There is no need to fear those who kill the body but 
              have no means of killing the soul; fear him more, who has the power 
              to ruin body and soul in hell".<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#11">11</a> 
              The use of the term "soul" in the Bible is far from uniform-it is 
              not used in a philosophical way. "Soul" signifies the spiritual 
              principle of humans coming from God and somehow remaining forever. 
            <p align=LEFT><b>Spirit</b> (Hebrew: <i>ruah</i>; Greek: <i>pneuma</i>; 
              Latin: <i>spiritus</i>) is used often in the Bible in different 
              senses. Sometimes it is a synonym for life, soul or living being, 
              people.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#12">12</a> Occasionally 
              it stands for the seat of feelings, thoughts, intentions. Sometimes 
              pneumata (spirits) describes the deceased ones.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#13">13</a> 
              With Paul we find very often spirit as the opposite to "flesh" (<i>sarx</i>). 
              Spirit stands for union with God, and thus also the body of the 
              redeemed ones (as referred to here, the body of the risen Christ) 
              is "spirit", whereas the whole existence of the sinner, who is "far 
              from God", is "flesh".<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#14">14</a> 
              Spirit is the divine power which justifies and sanctifies; flesh 
              is the weakness in which sin is dwelling and thriving. This "spirit" 
              is the "spirit of Christ"-the faithful become "One spirit with Christ."<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#15">15</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>There are some more expressions in the Bible which could 
              be used in order to show how "soul" is to be understood: we find 
              sometimes human essence expressed as "the heart" (Hebrew: <i>leb</i>; 
              Greek: <i>kardia</i>). Also "flesh" is used as expressing human 
              existence, not just in the negative sense. The terminology of the 
              Bible is far from uniform, and we do not find clear definitions 
              of the term. Life, soul and spirit stand for a reality which is 
              transcategorical. The Bible wants to make clear that the whole existence 
              of humans is from God, and depends on God, who is the "living God". 
            <p> <b>The Theology of the Early Church and the Middle Ages<br>
              </b>When Christianity came into contact with Greek philosophy it 
              had to give an answer to the problems posed by Greek philosophers. 
              Greek philosophy had already coined definite, mutually exclusive, 
              concepts of body and mind, matter and spirit, it had a "body-soul-problem" 
              which was unknown to the Bible. 
            <p align=LEFT>According to Plato the soul had a pre-existence as a 
              pure spirit in the realm of ideas. For some fault it had been imprisoned 
              in a body, and its liberation, its freedom, the regaining of its 
              own true nature, could only be through discarding the body. In the 
              Epicurean school the soul was considered to be inseparably connected 
              with matter. The death of the body meant the annihilation of the 
              "soul". The Aristotelians raised problems concerning the origin 
              of the soul, the existence of separate spiritual substances, the 
              nature of the soul, and the relation of body and soul. Representatives 
              of all schools, who had become Christians, tried to interpret the 
              Christian message in their respective terminology. 
            <p align=LEFT>It is interesting to observe that the early Church saw 
              a threat against its "soul- doctrine" coming more from the "spiritualistic" 
              schools than from "materialistic" doctrines. Therefore, the Apologetes 
              of the first and second century sometimes use expressions which 
              overemphasise the opposition to Neo-Platonism, sometimes calling 
              the soul "material and naturally mortal". Tertullian in his <i>De 
              Anima</i> seems to think of the soul as made of a very subtle material 
              substance. 
            <p align=LEFT>Manichaeism and Priscillianism tried to divide reality 
              into two hostile camps: the realm of God, spirit and light on the 
              one side, and the realm of the devil, body and darkness on the other. 
              The Councils of the Church opposed such a dualistic concept of reality. 
              They taught that the substance of the soul was not identical with 
              the substance of God, nor could it be considered a part, or transformation 
              of a part of it.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#16">16</a> The 
              body was not a creature of the devil, but was created by God, and 
              therefore in its nature good.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#17">17</a> 
              Marriage, instituted for the propagation of the human race was not 
              a devilish and sinful institution, but ordained by God and made 
              a sacrament.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#18">18</a> The human 
              body received through Christ's redemption a dignity of its own and 
              will rise again for life eternal.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#19"> 
              19</a> Human souls did not have any pre-existence in heaven before 
              they were united with the body, and it is not because of some fault 
              or sin of the soul that it becomes embodied.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#20">20</a> 
              The soul is not transmitted by the parents through natural generation, 
              but is created individually by God.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#21">21</a> 
              In death the soul becomes neither one with the substance of God, 
              nor does it perish altogether.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#22">22 
              </a> 
            <p align=LEFT>One of the questions repeatedly discussed throughout 
              antiquity concerned the time at which soul and body are united. 
              Aristotelian philosophers thought of a successive animation of the 
              body: in the moment of conception the body had only a "plant soul", 
              some months later this would be replaced by an "animal soul", and 
              only at birth the "spiritual-soul" would be given. The Christian 
              philosophers used the categories shaped by Greek philosophy, not 
              always fully aware that by doing so they shifted the centre of the 
              Biblical teaching. They no longer dealt with the human person as 
              whole, but with a "part", with "soul." For centuries Aristotle's 
              <i>Peri psyches</i> was the great textbook of philosophical psychology. 
              The greatest philosophers of the Middle Ages wrote commentaries 
              on it. Thomas Aquinas, whose <i>De Anima</i> is a classical treatise 
              of mediaeval psychology, lists the following questions: 
            <p align=LEFT>Can the soul be a form and a particular thing?<br>
              Is the soul, so far as its act of existing is concerned, separated 
              from the body?<br>
              Is there one possible intellect, or intellective soul, for all humans?<br>
              Is it necessary to admit that an agent intellect exists?<br>
              Is there one separately existing agent intellect for all humans?<br>
              Is the soul composed of matter and form?<br>
              Should the rational soul be united to a body such as humans possess?<br>
              Is the soul united to corporeal matter through a medium?<br>
              Are the rational, sentient and vegetative souls substantially one 
              and the same?<br>
              Is the soul its powers?<br>
              Are the powers of the soul distinguished from one another by their 
              objects?<br>
              Is the human soul incorruptible?<br>
              Is the soul, when separated from the body, capable of understanding?<br>
              When the soul is united to the body, can it understand separate 
              substances?<br>
              When the soul is separated from the body, can it understand separate 
              substances?<br>
              When separated from the body can the soul know all natural things?<br>
              When separated from the body can the soul suffer punishment by corporeal 
              fire? 
            <p align=LEFT>&nbsp;In response to the opposition of Manichaean dualism 
              Aquinas emphasises that the union of body and soul is essential 
              for humans, and that it is to the advantage of both body and soul. 
              "To be united to body is not to the detriment of the soul but to 
              its enrichment. There is the substantial benefit of completing human 
              nature, and the accidental benefit of achieving knowledge that can 
              only be acquired through the senses".<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#23">23</a> 
              He says that our body substance is not from an evil principle, as 
              the Manichaeans imagine, but from God. "By the friendship of charity, 
              by which we love God should we cherish the body."<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#24">24</a> 
              In his opinion the psycho-somatic interdependence goes so far that 
              the quality of intellectual life depends on the quality of the body. 
              When the body is a hindrance for the achievements of the higher 
              aims of human life, it is not due to its being body, but to sin 
              which corrupts the body and disturbs the harmony between body and 
              soul.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#25">25</a>

 align=LEFT>Another major problem was that of the "oneness of the intellect". 
              The back- ground lies in the Aristotelian concept of mind. Human 
              understanding comes about by an active process of the mind by which 
              mind abstracts from the (passive) objects an "idea" and makes it 
              its own, "assimilating" it to its own nature. To make this possible, 
              Aristotle had to assume a distinction in mind itself: an active 
              mind, which provides for the contact with the outside world and 
              which delivers to the "passive mind" the ideas, the abstractions 
              of things. "Passive mind" is a mere interiorising faculty and intellect 
              proper. 
            <p align=LEFT>But then how to explain the objectivity of human knowledge, 
              the likeness of ideas and understanding? Aristotle left this question 
              open. The great Arab interpreters of Aristotle, Averroes (Ibn Rosd 
              1126-98) and Avicenna (Ibn Sina 980-1037), tried to explain it by 
              some kind of "super-mind", an intellect which is common to all humans. 
              They asserted either that the active mind was common in the passive 
              individual, or that the passive mind was common in the active individual. 
              Thomas rejects this doctrine, which contains the danger of doing 
              away with personal responsibility and the individuality of men.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#26">26</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Human souls are manifold, and their oneness is not one 
              of substance, but of species. The "objectivity" and likeness in 
              understanding comes from the sameness of nature, not from the sameness 
              of existence. As bodies are different, the souls which are their 
              specific "form" are bound to be different.<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#27">27</a> 
              Against this background Aquinas defends the individual immortality 
              of the soul. After death the soul does not merge into any "supersoul", 
              neither separated substance nor Absolute, but remains an indi- vidual 
              human soul and capable of either beatitude or damnation: "Mind is 
              not composed of matter and form, for its ideas are not physical 
              but spiritual as their universality declares, they are abstract 
              and not tied down to matter or to the material conditions of time 
              and place. The mind is, therefore, a subsisting form, and is consequently 
              immortal." <a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#28">28</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>One of the favourite topics of mediaeval philosophy 
              was speculation about "separate substances", beings that are pure 
              spirit. The profound discussions about their location, their kind 
              and method of knowing, and their relation with the world of matter 
              have lost much of our interest. (It is interesting to note that 
              theoretical physicists have resurrected some of these problems and 
              terminology in their description of the mode of existence of subatomic 
              particles.) One topic, however, has gained more interest in our 
              times: the concept of "person". Thomas defines person in a very 
              gen- eral manner, as "individual substance of a spiritual nature". 
              Thus, it applies to hu- mans, angels and God. It does not express 
              any kind of limitation or restriction, but on the contrary, it means 
              the highest perfection in its order of being. It is a "name of eminence". 
            <p align=LEFT>Person ranks highest in the metaphysical scale of being. 
              Person means something unique, ineffable, a value in itself, an 
              end in itself. Person as such is indestructible. The ultimate stage 
              of perfection is therefore not a merging of created persons into 
              the uncreated (personal) Absolute, but a communion of persons, a 
              "being face to face", a "dialogue", between God and humans. 
            <p align=LEFT>While most of the psychological and anthropological 
              problems of mediaeval theology have lost their actual importance, 
              the problem of "person" has become the central issue of both modern 
              philosophical anthropology, as well as modern sociology. The human 
              understood as person is the end to which all non-personal values 
              have to be referred. It sets definite limits to the impersonal powers 
              such as state, party, nation or economy. It is the personality of 
              every human which distinguishes human society from an ant hill, 
              which makes human history different from natural history, which 
              gives a sense and a richness to human life.
