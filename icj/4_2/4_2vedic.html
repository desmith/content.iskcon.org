            <p><i>In this article Rahul Peter Das offers food for thought to devotees 
              by his astute examination of their usage of the term &quot;Vedic&quot;. 
              Interestingly he follows his initial analysis of Prabhupada's usage 
              by a comparative study of how Prabhupada's followers use the term. 
              His analysis is also a useful gauge of the 'South Asian Studies' 
              perspective on the use of the term &quot;Vedic&quot; in the Gaudiya 
              Vaishnava tradition in general. While showing that Prabhupada, previous 
              acaryas and contemporary Vaishnava scholars show a diverse usage 
              of the term. Das concludes his paper with interesting observations 
              on our lineage based on our perception of Vedic authority.</i> 
            <p>The term &quot;Vedic&quot; has many connotations - cultural, religious, 
              linguistic, literary and so forth. What this study is concerned 
              with is the use of the word to refer to certain texts regarded as 
              sacred and authoritative in a certain South Asian religious tradition 
              which has been successfully transplanted into the West. To this 
              end, we shall also have to consider the usage pertaining not only 
              to the term &quot;Vedic&quot;, but also to the term &quot;Veda&quot;. 
            <p>For an indologist of the nineteenth-century, matters were relatively 
              simple: before the period of what is generally called &quot;classical 
              Hinduism&quot; or the like, Indian culture was Indo-Aryan and at 
              the same time Vedic. This culture - simultaneously ancient Indian, 
              Vedic and Indo-Aryan - was that described by the class of texts 
              known as Vedic texts, that is, the Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas 
              and Upanishads, forming the Rigvedic, Samavedic, Yajurvedic and 
              Atharvavedic collections, along with (according to some scholars) 
              on historical grounds a few of the accompanying Sutras, even though 
              traditionally these latter are all regarded not as <i>sruti-,</i> 
              but as <i>smriti-.</i> 
            <p>For us today, things are unfortunately not that easy. &quot;Indo-Aryan&quot; 
              and &quot;Vedic&quot; are no more regarded as synonyms; ancient 
              Indian culture is no more automatically taken to be the same as 
              Vedic or Indo-Aryan culture; the texts mentioned are no longer taken 
              to be more or less comprehensive chronicles of the culture or cultures 
              of those times.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Among 
              Vedic scholars it is now generally accepted that there were in most 
              probability various groups of Indo-Aryans that did not necessarily 
              speak the language of, and/or did not necessarily adhere to the 
              religion or culture portrayed in, the texts mentioned above. Also, 
              scholars generally do not any more silently assume that the Indo-Aryans 
              entering South Asia came into a cultural, religious or linguistic 
              vacuum. This being so, one tends to be more careful in the use of 
              the terms &quot;Indo-Aryan&quot;, &quot;Vedic&quot; or &quot;ancient 
              Indian&quot; when referring to religion or culture. 
            <p>On the other hand, to the Western classical indologist, &quot;Vedic&quot; 
              in the sphere of linguistics and literature still has a fixed connotation-namely 
              as referring to the corpus of texts already mentioned and to the 
              language found in this. Of course, even this creates some difficulties, 
              particularly with regard to many later texts in a language clearly 
              not Vedic calling themselves Upanishads; but on the whole, the difficulties 
              in this sphere are not all that great. 
            <p>There is a difference, though, between what the classical indologist 
              understands under the term &quot;Veda&quot; and the corresponding 
              adjective &quot;Vedic&quot;, and what many South Asians (and many 
              Westerners following them) have during the course of centuries understood, 
              or today understand, under this term. In the oldest Vedic period 
              that we know of, <i>veda-</i> seems to have been used to denote 
              any sacred utterance. Since the late Vedic age, however, it denoted 
              the three collections of the Ric, Saman and Yajus. But throughout 
              history there have been other definitions, to the Western classical 
              indologist redefinitions of the term, allowing individual texts 
              which are not Vedic by the definition mentioned above to be subsumed 
              by, or appended to, the traditions of hallowed ancient texts, thus 
              letting them partake of the sacrality and authoritativeness attributed 
              to the Vedas. The oldest example of this is the controversy regarding 
              the <i>Atharvavedasamhita</i> and the Vedic texts associated with 
              it, and the process has encompassed various texts such as the epics, 
              Puranas, and also individual traditional scholarly texts and traditions. 
              It is needless to go into details here, as the matter has already 
              been chronicled by others.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
              Such claims have been, and continue to be, controversial in South 
              Asia itself. This means that what we are dealing with is a problem 
              that cannot simply be attributed to the incomprehension of supercilious 
              Westerners. 
            <p>There is, however, another South Asian tradition which more or 
              less accepts the Vedic texts as being what the Western classical 
              indologist understands the term to be, but which sees historically 
              later texts as being part of the same stream as these Vedic texts, 
              or else as subsuming the matter contained in them and in some cases 
              thus even being superior to them.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
              The culmination of this tradition - we might even call it the most 
              radical application - is found in the school of Gaudiya Vaishnavism 
              attributing itself to Chaitanya, especially in the <i>Tattvasandarbha</i> 
              of Jiva Goswamin.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
              Though great emphasis is also placed upon the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> 
              in this regard, it is in particular the <i>Bhagavatapurana</i> for 
              which the claim of containing the teachings and precepts of the 
              Vedas in their purest and most comprehensive form is made.<a
 href="http://www.icj.iskcon.net/4_2vedicfoot.htm5"><sup>5</sup></a> This is a 
              claim often challenged, the most famous of such challenges being 
              probably that by Rammohun Roy in 1818 in his reply to a Goswamin's 
              letter.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> Rammohun even 
              accused the Gaudiya Vaishnavas of falsifying evidence by passing 
              off verses composed by themselves as Puranic so as to make their 
              point. Of special interest in this context is the statement of Elkman 
              (op.cit. in note 4), p.41 on the views of Baladeva, whose commentary 
              (<i>Govindabhasya</i>) on the <i>Tattvasandarbha</i> is generally 
              regarded as the most authoritative in Gaudiya Vaishnava circles: 
            <ul>
              <p> Baladeva argues for the supremacy of <i>sabda pramana</i>, as 
                does Jiva, but restricts his definition of <i>sabda</i> to the 
                Vedas and Upanishads, thus contradicting the important Gaudiya 
                Vaishnava belief in the authoritative nature of Puranas, particulary 
                the <i>Bhagavata Purana.</i> 
            </ul>
            <p>Be that as it may, since it is this very Gaudiya Vaishnavism to 
              which Abhay Caran Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a>, 
              the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              (ISKCON), claimed affiliation, an examination of what Prabhupada 
              understood under the term &quot;Vedic&quot; is clearly of relevance, 
              not only for our understanding of his personal system of beliefs, 
              but also of the tradition from which he came. I have therefore gone 
              through his writings with this question in mind. 
            <p>Not all of Prabhupada's various published works contain relevant 
              statements in this regard. As a case in point, I may cite the only 
              reference to Vedic I could find in his work on the <i>Mukundamalastotra</i><a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a>, 
              namely the non-committal: &quot;The Vedic literature, prepared by 
              Shrila Vyasadeva and filled with narrations of the Lord and His 
              devotees...&quot;, which does not tell us what this Vedic literature 
              actually is. I am therefore confining myself here to a discussion 
              of only those works in which I found information pertinent to our 
              particular query. Of course, I cannot claim to have gone through 
              each and every one of the countless words to be found in the many 
              writings of Prabhupada, and thus I have surely missed some information 
              I should have included in my study. But I believe that on the whole 
              I was able to gather enough material of relevance, and doubt that 
              what statements I may have missed will deviate in any substantial 
              manner from this. Also, it should be pointed out that I have based 
              my deliberations only on those statements which in my opinion are 
              absolutely clear: Prabhupada has of course made innumerable remarks 
              which tend in the same direction or can easily be interpreted similarly, 
              but which either do not expressly mention the terms &quot;Veda&quot; 
              or &quot;Vedic&quot;, or else do not contain information characterising 
              them clearly. 
            <p>A word of caution with regard to the purpose of my examination 
              would not be out of place here. I have merely tried to collect Prabhupada's 
              own words on the subject, without any attempt at evaluating or interpreting 
              them with regard to their theological significance or their historical 
              evolution. Also, my examination does not attempt in any way to determine 
              whether his interpretations of texts such as the <i> Bhagavadgita</i> 
              and the<i> Bhagavatapurana,</i> on which he relied heavily in his 
              writings, are in any way &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. 
              The <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> especially, would represent a great problem 
              for any such attempt anyway, as has already been pointed out by 
              others.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a> The question 
              of any theological implication of my examination may best be left 
              to Prabhupada's followers themselves. 
            <p>There are many statements in the writings of Prabhupada that differentiate 
              between the Vedas on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the Puranas, 
              particularly the <i>Bhagavatapurana,</i> as well as the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> 
              and the <i>Mahabharata</i> (both often mentioned separately, even 
              though Prabhupada takes pains to point out again and again that 
              the former is a part of the latter)<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#10"><sup>10</sup></a>, 
              the <i>Ramayana,</i> the <i>Pancaratra</i> and the <i>Vedantasutra</i> 
              (or <i>Brahmasutra</i>).<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#11"> <sup>11</sup></a> 
              He also differentiates between the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> and the Vedas 
              by writing that in the former Krishna personally states that &quot;the 
              Vedas are different laws given by the Lord&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#12"><sup>12</sup></a> 
              - laws thus obviously different from those in the <i>Bhagavadgita.</i> 
              The latter is also characterised as clarifying the Vedas, and thus 
              different from them.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#13"><sup>13</sup></a> 
            <p> At times, the differentiation is not with the Vedas, but with 
              &quot;Vedic literature&quot;.<a
 href="4_2vedicfoot.html#14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Puranas and &quot;Vedic literature&quot; 
              are also termed &quot;sister literatures&quot;.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#15"><sup>15</sup></a> 
              The Vedas are often described as four or enumerated by name, namely 
              as the Vedas of Rg, Yajus, Säman and Atharvan.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#16"><sup>16</sup></a> 
              They are called <i>sruti-,</i> and are differentiated from other 
              texts characterised as <i>smriti-.</i> But <i>sruti-</i> and <i>smriti-</i> 
              are also differentiated from the Puranas and Pancaratra.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#17"><sup>17</sup></a> 
              The <i>Bhagavadgita</i> is called <i>smriti-</i>.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#18"><sup>18</sup></a> 
            <p> All this seems to show that Prabhupada is squarely in accord with 
              Western classical indologists in regard to what he understands under 
              the term &quot;Veda&quot;. But actually things are not that clear, 
              for there are other statements which create difficulties for this 
              deduction, statements which are, however, in accord with well-known 
              beliefs of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Thus, in spite of his differentiating 
              between Vedic and non-Vedic literature, Prabhupada nevertheless 
              regards some texts which are non-Vedic by this definition - particularly 
              the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> and the <i>Bhägavatapurana</i> - as being 
              the essence of Vedic thought.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#19"><sup>19</sup></a> 
            <p> The Vedic mantras are said to be explicated and supplemented by 
              the Puranas and the <i>Mahabharata</i>.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#20"> 
              <sup>20</sup></a> In this regard Prabhupada is clearly echoing Bhaktibinod 
              Thakur<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#21"><sup>21</sup></a>, who regarded 
              the Puranas as &quot;explanatory notes&quot; of the Vedas.<a
 href="4_2vedicfoot.html#22"><sup>22</sup></a> &quot;Veda&quot; is moreover defined 
              as &quot;the aggregate of knowledge&quot;, and it is held that &quot;whatever 
              knowledge is required for human society is perfectly presented in 
              the <i>Shrimad-Bhagavatam</i>.&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#23"><sup>23</sup></a> 
              This is so because, according to Prabhupada, Vyäsa wrote the Bhagavatapurana 
              as an explanation of the <i>Vedantasutra</i> (or <i>Brahmasutra</i>), 
              which itself contains the essence of the Upanishads.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#24"><sup>24</sup></a> 
              The <i>Bhagavatapurana</i> explains not only the <i>Brahmasutra,</i> 
              but also the <i>Mahabharata</i>.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#25"><sup>25</sup></a> 
              Indeed, the <i>Vedantasutra</i> and <i>Bhagavatapurana</i> are regarded 
              as being superior to the Vedas, viz. the four Samhitas and &quot;their 
              corollaries known as s<i> iksha, kalpa, vyakarana, nirukta, chanda 
              </i>and<i> jyotisha</i>&quot; by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasbati Thakur;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#26"><sup>26</sup></a> 
              Prabhupada obviously approves of this opinion.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#27"><sup>27</sup></a> 
            <p> Vyäsa also divided the Veda(s)<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#28"><sup>28</sup></a> 
              into four divisions (namely the four known divisions of Rig, Saman, 
              Yajus and Atharvan), or else compiled them. After that he authored 
              the Puranas, or expanded the Vedas into these. Vyäsa is also called 
              the author, not only of the Brahmasutra<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#29"><sup>29</sup></a> 
              together with its commentary, the Bhägavatapurana, but also of the 
              Mahabharata (containing the Bhagavadgita).<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#30"><sup>30</sup></a> 
              Indeed, before Vyasa, the Vedas were &quot;simply heard&quot;, and 
              it was he who wrote them down: &quot;he left all the Vedic knowledge 
              in book form, such as the <i> Puranas, Vedanta, Mahabharata </i>and<i> 
              Shrimad-Bhagavatam</i>.&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#31"><sup>31</sup></a> 
              Elsewhere, Prabhupada says: 
            <ul>
              <p>The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, çüdras and 
                unqualified sons of the higher castes, are devoid of necessary 
                qualifications to understand the purpose of the transcendental 
                Vedas. For them the <i>Mahabharata</i> was prepared. 
            </ul>
            <p>The text goes on to say that the <i>Mahabharata</i> contains the 
              summary of the Vedas called the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> which is thus 
              &quot;the essence of all Vedic knowledge&quot;.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#32"><sup>32</sup></a> 
            <p>All these texts are also called Vedic,<a
 href="4_2vedicfoot.html#33"><sup>33</sup></a> and they all go back to Vyasa, 
              who is the author of all Vedic literature, and an incarnation of 
              Narayana.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#34"><sup>34</sup></a> Thus it 
              is actually Krishna who divided the Vedas into four, and explained 
              these in the Puranas: &quot;for less capable people He wrote the 
              <i>Mahabharata</i>&quot; (of which the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> is a 
              part), at the same time summarising all Vedic literature in the 
              <i>Vedantasutra,</i> and commenting on this in the <i>Bhagavatapurana</i>.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#35"><sup>35</sup></a> 
            <p>Echoing an old, though not universally accepted opinion in South 
              Asia, Prabhupada also says that the <i>Mahabharata</i> is regarded 
              as the fifth Veda, and that this therefore also applies to the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> 
              contained within it.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#36"><sup>36</sup></a> 
              This, we are told, &quot;is also Vedic literature (<i>smriti</i>). 
              Some of the Vedic literatures are called <i>srutis,</i> and some 
              are called <i>smritis</i>.&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#37"><sup>37</sup></a> 
            <p> This statement, which echoes older notions such as, for instance, 
              those of the <i>Sarvamatasangraha</i>,<a
 href="4_2vedicfoot.html#38"><sup>38</sup></a> is very interesting. That the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> 
              is expressly called <i>smriti-</i> shows that it is not part of 
              the Vedic literature in the sense we have discussed first, and which 
              Prabhupada himself calls <i>srruti.</i> Yet it is nevertheless called 
              Vedic. And Prabhupada also expressly says that both <i> smriti</i> 
              and <i>sruti</i> are Vedic, which tallies with what we have just 
              seen on other texts such as the epics, Puranas, and others also 
              being called &quot;Vedic&quot;. 
            <p>These two definitions of &quot;Vedic&quot; are irreconcilable semantically; 
              and so it is clear that what we have here are actually two different 
              meanings of the word &quot;Vedic&quot;. I propose to designate them 
              as &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub>&quot; and &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot; 
              respectively. &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub> &quot; is used in the sense 
              in which Western classical indologists also generally use the term; 
              whereas &quot;Vedic2&quot; has a much wider application and may 
              subsume &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub>.&quot; &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub>&quot; 
              obviously is more a linguistic and historical term, whereas &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot; 
              derives more from the contents of the works so labelled. It is consistent 
              with this latter meaning that Prabhupada also says that &quot;Vedic 
              knowledge is called sruti&quot;, <a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#39"><sup>39</sup></a> 
              a mode of expression which allows a very wide interpretation. 
            <p>That this use of the same word to designate two different things 
              may cause confusion is clear. Prabhupada too seems to have been 
              aware of this, for every so often we find that he uses &quot;Vedic 
              literatures&quot; when he refers to what I have called &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot;,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#40"><sup>40</sup></a> 
              although he is following no rule with this inasmuch as the terms 
              &quot;Vedic&quot; and &quot;Vedic literature&quot; too are used 
              in this same context. However, as far as I can see, &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub>&quot; 
              seems to be associated mostly with these latter terms, not with 
              &quot;Vedic literatures&quot;. I did, however, also find a reference 
              to &quot;Vedic literatures&quot; with only the Upanishads mentioned 
              as examples,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#41"><sup>41</sup></a> as 
              well as a differentiation between &quot;all the Vedic literatures&quot; 
              and the Puranas.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#42"> <sup>42</sup></a> 
              On the other hand, I found, too, a definition of the expression 
              &quot;Vedic literatures&quot; that substantiates the deduction that 
              as a rule this term refers to &quot;Vedic&quot;: 
            <ul>
              <p>The Vedas - Sama, Yajur, Rig and Atharva - and any books deriving 
                knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic literatures.<a
