            <p><b>Mediaeval Visions of Soul and God<br>
              </b>Beginning with Paul, Christianity relied on visions as an important 
              and genuine me- dium of communication between God and humans. Since 
              that time visionaries have described an "out-of-body-experience" 
              as the initial phase of such a visionary event. The soul detaches 
              itself from the body, often looking at the body as it were from 
              a distance, always recognising the body as its own, whether being 
              delighted by its con- templation as Alpais de Cudot (p.55),<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#29">29</a> 
              or horrified by it as Elsbeth Stagel (p.112), and beholding itself, 
              before being immersed in the vision of God. The self-description 
              of the soul is usually in terms of light and brightness: 
            <ul>
              <p>She was a round, beautiful and illuminating light, like the sun, 
                of a golden red hue, and that light was so immensely beautiful 
                and pleas- ant that I cannot compare it with anything else. If 
                all the stars in heaven were as large and beautiful as the sun 
                and were combined into one splendour, it could not compare with 
                the beauty in my soul. It appeared to me as if a light was issuing 
                from me which illuminated the whole world, and the whole world 
                enjoyed a glorious day. And in this light, which was my soul, 
                I saw God whine blissfully, like a beau- tiful light in a beautiful 
                lamp stand, and I saw that he so lovingly and graciously joined 
                my soul that he became totally one with her. And in this union 
                of love my soul received from God the assurance that all my sins 
                were completely forgiven, and that she was so pure and clean as 
                she was after baptism (Elsbeth Stagel, pp.111-2). 
            </ul>
            <p>In a more abstract way, Alpais de Cudot described the soul as "simple, 
              invisible, incorporeal, not divided into parts like the body, present 
              as a whole in whatever she does..the soul is not in a particular 
              place. As God is everywhere... so the soul is everywhere in the 
              body, more powerfully in heart and brain, as one says that God is 
              in a special way in heaven..." (pp.56-8). 
            <p>While being in that condition, the soul is not making any distinctions 
              between good and bad, noble or ignoble. As Angela da Foligno reports: 
            <ul>
              <p>I perceive (God) present and recognise how He is present in all 
                of nature, in everything that is, in the demon, the good angel, 
                in hell, in paradise, in adultery and murder, in every good deed, 
                in beautiful and ugly things. When I am in this truth I am as 
                happy when I see God or an angel or a good deed or an evil one...when 
                the soul sees that it cannot take offence at anything (p.142). 
            </ul>
            <p>Mystics emphasise that in that vision everything belonging to the 
              previous state of soul disappears and is transcended, including 
              faith. As brother Aegidius said: "Whosoever has faith in the perfect 
              way in which one ought to have it, God will take it from him". When 
              asked what he would do in such a "faith-less" state if he had to 
              celebrate Mass (which requires the priest to say "I believe In God..."), 
              Brother Aegidius began singing with a strong voice: "I know One 
              God, Father Almighty." 
            <p><b>The Destiny of the Soul according to Michael Schmaus<br>
              </b>Christian tradition has always affirmed the spirit-soul's substantiality, 
              immortality and individuality. Its "destiny", then, was perceived 
              as fulfilment of its natural longing for God. Popularly (and biblically) 
              that fulfilment has been described as "heaven". The "joys of heaven" 
              have been held up to Christians of all generations as compensation 
              for the denial of earthly enjoyments and as an incentive to not 
              only fulfil the commandments, but to exert themselves to the utmost 
              in the service of God on earth. For many centuries "eschatology" 
              has been a major part of systematic theology; and within eschatology 
              the heavenly existence of the soul has been dealt with quite extensively. 
              Due to the speculative nature of the subject, individual presentations 
              by different theologians widely diverge. It is also here that the 
              factional feuds and prejudices of denominationally-defined Christianity 
              become painfully apparent: the qualifications for entering "heaven" 
              are usually the same as those required for joining a particular 
              church or sect. 
            <p>In the following I am summarising the views of the well-known twentieth 
              century theologian Michael Schmaus (1883-97), whose <i>Katholische 
              Dogmatik</i>, appearing in many editions during his lifetime, has 
              been quite influential. It also is expansive and detailed. According 
              to Schmaus "with death begins a kind of existence that lies beyond 
              all experience-it is the authentic form of existence, intended by 
              God from eternity. Its perfect form is only gained in the resurrection."<a href="4_2klostermaierfoot.html#30">30</a> 
            <p>The "separated soul" leads a kind of in-between existence: "Human 
              spirit is intended for an existence in, with and through a body". 
              For Schmaus "the belief that death liberates spirit from the body 
              is a romantic-idealistic misunderstanding" whose "historic roots 
              are to be found in platonic/neo-platonic anthropology". He asserts, 
              however, that "according to Catholic doctrine the spirit-soul is 
              alive and awake in the period between death and resurrection." 
            <p>Referring to official Church pronouncements, such as the 1336 papal 
              bull "Benedictus Deus" by Benedict XII, he tells us that the following 
              souls are already living in paradise: the saints deceased before 
              the coming of Jesus Christ, the apostles, martyrs, faithful who 
              have been baptised (both those who did not need cleansing and those 
              who were cleansed), and baptised children. (The fateful statement 
              "Extra ecclesiam nully salus" was usually understood to mean that 
              nobody who had not been baptised after the coming of Christ could 
              go to heaven; at best a kind of "limbo" could be reached, the same 
              place where unbaptised infants were supposed to dwell.) 
            <p>The souls in heaven "have an immediate vision of the divine essence, 
              face to face"; they are blissful. Heaven not only is the ultimate 
              "destiny of the soul", but also the "completion of God's reign in 
              individual humans". Schmaus speaks of it as "a de- fined area" and 
              "a form of existence". "Heaven as "home" was meant as the soul's 
              ultimate destiny from the very beginning. There is no way beyond 
              it..." 
            <p>Heaven also is a "living in Christ and Christ in us", a "conscious 
              direct beholding of Christ". According to the Council of Florence 
              "the blessed see the Triune God as He is without image and mediation". 
              Schmaus amplifies: "The blessed soul sees the glory of the Being 
              of God and the life-exchange of the three divine persons. He sees 
              in God and through God also the world in the right light." The blessed 
              takes delight in contemplating the qualities of God and participates 
              in the conversation between the three divine persons: "In this conversation 
              the perfect comes to know the secret of God and world. The Father 
              explains to him everything that He tells the Son..." 
            <p>The distinction, however, between God and humans is not obliterated. 
              "God remains superior to humans in a non-sublateable way... They 
              remain different as creator and creature. Also, in heaven, God remains 
              for humans an impenetrable mystery.Humans cannot understand everything 
              that the Father tells the Son..." 
            <p>Schmaus emphasises both the individuality of the perfect, and the 
              community character of heaven. But, "everybody remains a mystery 
              for everybody." 
            <p>&nbsp;"Uninterruptedly the blessed gain new, delightful insights 
              into the wonderworks of creation from the vision of God... fulfilment 
              of every genuine desire for knowledge, love and happiness." And, 
              "the dominion which has been promised by Christ to the blessed, 
              which is a participation in his own dominion, comprises all of creation. 
              Everybody is Lord of the entire world." 
            <p><b>Reflections on Christian Perspectives on the Soul and Its Destiny<br>
              </b>Christianity did not begin as a coherent philosophical system, 
              but as a branch ("fulfilment") of Judaism, which itself had no clear-cut 
              and agreed upon teaching on the nature of the soul. Some of its 
              schools did not accept the notion of an individual life eternal 
              others maintained conflicting views on life after death. The Christian 
              New Testament, as specialists like; the scholars of the "Jesus-Seminar" 
              tell us, is largely the creation of the Christian Church(es) of 
              the first two centuries: only about 15% of the sayings attributed 
              to Jesus are today considered authentic Jesus-words. The constant 
              divisions within the Christian Church-virtually from beginning-lead 
              eventually to the establishment of several thousand Christian Churches 
              which maintained their own sets of beliefs and practices and did 
              not encourage the development of a systematic, commonly accepted, 
              philosophy of "soul". 
            <p>Sayings attributed to Jesus use the word <i>psyche</i> in a colloquial, 
              popular sense. It does not emerge clearly whether an eternal soul 
              was ascribed to each and every individual human being, or only to 
              the "elect". (That Christianity had a problem in this area emerges 
              from the mediaeval discussion "whether women have souls", and from 
              the early modern issue of not ascribing souls to the "savages" of 
              newly discovered America.) Paul seems to not only maintain the existence 
              of a "spirit" (<i>pneuma</i>) over and above psyche (and <i>sarx</i>), 
              but also to assume that only those who had the pneuma possessed 
              immortality. 
            <p>The early Christian preachers did not win adherents by effectively 
              arguing for a convincing philosophy of the soul but by telling the 
              Jews that their hope for a Messiah had been fulfilled, and by telling 
              non-Jews that Jesus was "Lord". Eventually it was the military victory 
              of Constantine which gave Christianity the status of a state religion. 
              The first step taken by Christians in power was not the establishment 
              of theological centres, but the assumption of secular offices and 
              the displacement of pre-Christian religion and its officials; philosophical 
              schools and institutions of learning were closed down without replacement. 
              A strong anti-intellectual and anti-philosophical strain has characterised 
              much of Christianity throughout its history. 
            <p>Initially it was only individual Christians who had had the benefit 
              of a "pagan" education (like Basil or Augustine) who made an effort 
              to philosophically digest Christian teaching in order to formulate 
              a "Christian philosophy". Even they, when facing real philosophical 
              problems, quickly resorted to "revelation", and denounced secular 
              philosophers as being in error. 
            <p>A major boost in the direction of developing a soul-philosophy 
              came in the early Middle Ages when, due to the appropriation and 
              utilisation of Greek philosophy by the early Muslims, a challenge 
              was thrown at Christianity in the very heartland of Europe. Christian 
              teachers seriously attempted to cast their teaching in a philosophical 
              systematic mould. Neither did this happen without major opposition 
              from within the Church, nor did it result in a definite and universally 
              accepted doc- trinal position on such crucial questions as the nature 
              and the destiny of the soul. While some principles of Aristotelian 
              philosophical psychology-like the axiom of the soul being the <i>forma 
              corporis</i>-became official Church teaching (established at some 
              minor Councils), the resistance against the attempt to make Christianity 
              a more philosophical religion grew inside the Church, and became 
              a major factor in the major break-up of Western Christianity, called 
              the "Reformation". Luther, for instance, had nothing but contempt 
              for the "pagan philosophers" and for those who tried to bring their 
              teachings into the Christian faith. <i>Sola fide</i> became the 
              watchword the "whore reason" was to be driven away from God's temple. 
            <p>It is accepted as a matter of course today that each Christian 
              denomination has its own theology and its own doctrines concerning 
              such matters as the nature and destiny of the soul. It is also accepted 
              that within each denomination every major theologian would have 
              their own version and interpretation of such doctrines. Some contemporary 
              theologians interpret (or reinterpret) traditional teachings on 
              the soul in a Freudian or Jungian perspective, without expressing 
              clearly whether they accept the reality of what they talk about. 
              Most pastors would squirm when confronted with the question of whether 
              they really believed what their Churches officially teach about 
              the soul and its destiny. "Post-modernism" in a variety of ways 
              has made in- roads into the thinking even of non-intellectuals. 
              It is no longer politically correct to assert the unqualified reality 
              of anything, or to assume that one can know truth. It is telling 
              that "soul" does not appear in the index of as influential a popular 
              theological work as Matthew Fox's <i> Original Blessing</i> (Sigmund 
              Freud, Erik Fromm, Carl Gustav Jung, besides Thomas Aquinas and 
              Meister Eckhart do appear, however!). 
            <p>While "officially" nothing has been taken back from the late mediaeval 
              Church teaching on "soul", in practice not much of it seems to matter. 
              Since the eighteenth century the West has gone through an anti-metaphysical 
              phase, and "soul" (in the sense understood by the scholastics) is 
              no longer the subject matter of serious scientific / philosophical 
              investigation. The "psychological" notion of human nature seems 
              to have penetrated fairly deeply. One consults a psychologist when 
              in "psychological" trouble; one trains "specialists" to deal with 
              "psychic trauma"; but one hardly recognises a need for a "curate 
              of the soul" in the literal (Socratic) sense. 
            <p>Concerning the destiny of the soul, for most contemporary Christians 
              "heaven" is not much of an attraction, nor is "hell" much of a deterrent 
              in the pursuit of their "legitimate interests". The main, if not 
              exclusive concern is with a good life here and now, with health 
              (physical and mental) and with security (job and financial). Those 
              who assume a life after death do not argue along dogmatic / metaphysical 
              lines, but refer to "near-death-experiences", mostly enjoyable, 
              and purely on the level of individual experience. The contemporary 
              euthanasia debate does not contain references to the fate of the 
              eternal soul, but has an exclusive foreground ethical concern arising 
              largely from the fear that euthanasia may be misused. 
            <p>As far as the dialogue of Christianity with Vaishnavism is concerned, 
              it will be indispensable to openly face the present situation as 
              described. Both Vaishnavas and Christians have to rethink their 
              traditional teachings on the background of contemporary psychology 
              and neuro-science, and have to restate their metaphysics in a contemporary 
              idiom. They must recognise the historico-cultural conditioning of 
              traditional teaching without giving up the timeless insights expressed 
              in them. Vaishnavism was always perceived to be close to Christianity 
              in its theology and its ritual practices. It may be possible to 
              find a common language to speak about the soul and its destiny that 
              could religiously inspire late-20th-century women and men.
