            <p><b>Prabhupada and the Organisation of ISKCON<br>
              </b>While Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was the charismatic messenger 
              of Krishna consciousness, he was also in the early years of the 
              ISKCON movement (1966-1970) a very practical "manager", a kind of 
              CEO, who maintained a vital interest in the financial and organisational 
              life of the fledgling movement. He was not removed from the everyday 
              life of the movement, and was aware and responsive to the economic, 
              social and legal challenges facing ISKCON. His disciples were much 
              impressed with what they called his "practicality", "business sense" 
              and even "worldliness". To these disciples, this was additional 
              evidence of the uniqueness of their leader. "He could move", said 
              one disciple, "from the most complicated philosophical discussion 
              to the details of real estate contracts with utter ease." When discussing 
              financial matters, a long-time disciple explains: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada was the most practical. At those times 
                we used to call him the "managing director". Anyone who saw him 
                at these times and had a sentimental idea of guru was set straight. 
                We, who are supposed to be practical Americans, just could not 
                match him.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#7">7</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>What impressed many of his young followers were Prabhupada's 
              multifaceted activities as spiritual teacher, administrator, priest, 
              counsellor, musician and, for some, even master cook. The religious 
              figures, if any, already known to the early followers were primarily 
              religious functionaries or teachers in contemporary Christian or 
              Jewish religious settings. Such persons may have been very much 
              committed to their religious duties, but interaction with their 
              congregations was primarily impersonal and role-orientated-what 
              sociologists term "secondary relations". To his disciples, Prabhupada 
              was different. He was an Indian guru who was a complete "spiritual 
              master" to them, and his teachings extended to the totality of their 
              being. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada's acumen in organising ISKCON was made possible 
              by the clarity of his religious vision, and his willingness to be 
              flexible and innovative in pursuit of his goals. Flexibility in 
              both theological and ritual matters could be incorporated into his 
              leadership not only because he was the charismatic prophet-his decisions 
              had the quality of absolute truth-but also because he knew beforehand 
              the limits of innovation and compromise. As one initiated into an 
              orthodox Hindu tradition and authorised to represent it as a teacher, 
              Prabhupada was restrained by the parameters of that tradition, and 
              any organisational innovations took place within traditionally prescribed 
              religious guidelines. The presence of such "controlled change" enabled 
              the movement to respond to changing social conditions and organisational 
              needs while maintaining conformity with the strictures of Vaishnava 
              traditions and its sacred texts. 
            <p align=LEFT>The theme of flexibility amidst tradition-change and 
              continuity-is particularly seen in Prabhupada's religious gradualism. 
              He did not introduce the full Indian religious liturgy immediately, 
              but waited, adding little by little, so that by 1969-1970 temple 
              practices (and ascetic discipline) were almost the equivalent of 
              their Indian counterparts. In the early period (1966-1968) temple 
              services were informal, and to a degree, even spontaneous, expressions 
              of the particular group that happened to assemble. Though the Hare 
              Krishna mantra was chanted at each meeting, the formal structure 
              of the Indian ritual was not yet followed. Thomas J. Hopkins (1983:105), 
              an early scholarly observer of ISKCON, noted that "people would 
              come in off the street bringing whatever instrument they happened 
              to play and simply dive into the <i>bhajan</i>.Very few really knew 
              at that point that there was a formal structure." Gradually, however, 
              these informal gatherings gave way to a more structured and traditional 
              form of worship. By 1969, Hopkins (1983:107) tells us: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Disciples now celebrate daily worship with morning 
                puja to the image of Krishna in their temple shrine and with evening 
                kirtana, celebrate Hindu holy days, perform regular daily chanting 
                of rounds of Krishna mantras using their bead rosaries, have learned 
                Indian musical styles and adopted Indian food and dress, and in 
                an amazing way, for such a short period of time, have assimilated 
                their living patterns to a Hindu model. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>The early initiations of disciples were also frequently 
              spontaneous and informal affairs, as were the first ISKCON weddings. 
              Some of the early devotees were not even clear as to the full meaning 
              of the "regulative principles"-the rules prohibiting meat-eating, 
              intoxication, illicit sex and gambling. Prabhupada's willingness 
              to be flexible and tolerate ambiguity made the transition of Krishna 
              consciousness to America possible. A premature demand for complete 
              ritual and personal religious orthodoxy might have left ISKCON stillborn. 
            <p align=LEFT>Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Prabhupada's official biographer, 
              tells us (1981:28) that in the early years, Prabhupada would initiate 
              his followers as disciples despite their inexperience and ritual 
              laxity, as long as he felt they were spiritually serious: 
            <ul>
              <p>One night in the temple, during the question-and-answer sessions, 
                a big, bearded fellow raised his hand and asked Prabhupada, "Can 
                I become initiated?" <br>
                The brash public request annoyed some of Prabhupada's followers, 
                but Prabhupada was serene. "Yes", he replied. "But first you must 
                answer two questions. Who is Krishna?"<br>
                The boy thought for a moment and said, "Krishna is God." <br>
                "Yes", Prabhupada replied. "And who are you?" <br>
                Again the boy thought for a few moments and then replied, "I am 
                the servant of God." <br>
                "Very good", Prabhupada said. "Yes, you can be initiated tomorrow." 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>But Prabhupada's ritual and cultural flexibility and 
              gradualism had distinct boundaries. When some early followers told 
              him that Americans don't like to hear that sex is meant only for 
              conceiving children, Prabhupada replied, "I cannot change the philosophy 
              to please the Americans." When Steve Goldstein, an early ISKCON 
              attorney and supporter protested, "Sex is a very strong force. What 
              a man feels for a woman is undeniable", Prabhupada (S. Goswami, 
              1980:239) replied, 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Therefore in every culture there is the institution 
                of marriage. You can get yourself married and live peacefully 
                with one woman, but the wife should not be used as a machine for 
                sense gratification. Sex should be restricted to once a month 
                and only for the propagation of children. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada was opposed to the central values and behavioural 
              norms of Western culture. His attitude toward Western civilisation, 
              much like other radical critics of modernity, was that "the skills 
              should be pursued, but the values rejected."<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#8">8</a> 
              A consistent theme in his teaching was the ontological inferiority 
              of Western culture. As the heir of an Eastern religious tradition, 
              Prabhupada rejected the underlying premises of Western modernism, 
              its scientism, its understanding of the human condition and its 
              aesthetic sense. He saw the religious traditions of India as superior 
              to Western forms. These perceptions and attitudes left Prabhupada 
              free to be organisationally innovative, because all such modifications 
              took place on the level of technique, and did not include theological 
              or value compromise. Bhaktivedanta's vision was certain: his aim 
              was to transplant an ancient Indian religious tradition to the West. 
              The various adjustments, reorganisations, or redefinitions he made 
              were but means for the realisation of this one superordinate goal. 
            <p align=LEFT>Though he was opposed to the fundamental assumptions 
              of Western culture, he was conscious of what he referred to as the 
              importance of "time, place and circumstance". In deference to American 
              norms, Prabhupada cautioned his American-born devotees to follow 
              established organisational forms in the day-to-day administration 
              of ISKCON. In a letter to temple leaders dated October 13, 1969 
              (T. K. Goswami, 1984:188), he put it this way: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>I have seen the agenda of your presidents' meeting. 
                This is nice. One thing should be followed, however, as your countrymen 
                are more or less independent spirited and lovers of democracy. 
                So everything should be done very carefully so that their sentiments 
                may not be hurt. According to Sanskrit moral principles, everything 
                has to be acted, taking consideration of the place, audience and 
                time. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In the early years of ISKCON, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada 
              was the authority who made the decisions (he even disbursed petty 
              cash) and, as the Indian tradition dictates, expected and received 
              complete obedience from his followers. But it would be a misunderstanding 
              to interpret this as encouraging passivity and restricting initiative 
              among his disciples. Prabhupada delegated to his followers the task 
              of administering and developing ISKCON as a religious institution 
              with a solid financial base. In many cases, disciples with little 
              prior experience were sent out to accomplish major undertakings, 
              and, through commitment and support of the ISKCON community, were 
              often quite successful. "Prabhupada's men", as his most intimate 
              devotees came to be known, were not indecisive types who could be 
              easily intimidated. In extant documents, they appear determined, 
              goal oriented and highly competent. Although Prabhupada spoke in 
              a theological way of submission to the master, he does not appear 
              to have been surrounded by "yes men". 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada's leadership was also typified by a kind 
              of resourcefulness that seems to be typical of charismatic leaders. 
              He was the type of leader who, when confronted with difficulty in 
              realising a particular plan of action, would "come up with another 
              that bypassed the obstacle",<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#9">9</a> 
              with each plan legitimated theologically in terms of sacred text. 
              When Jayananda, president of the San Francisco temple, complained 
              to Prabhupada that the temple community was facing economic hardship 
              because only a few devotees worked, while the rest spent the day 
              exclusively in devotional activities, Prabhupada (TK Goswami, 1984:26) 
              addressed a group of San Francisco devotees: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>It is not fair that the entire burden is on Jayananda. 
                All the <i>brahmacaris</i> may also get jobs. Devotees should 
                not be lazy, idle class. Our temples are not meant for simply 
                eating and sleeping. We are not afraid to work. Whatever our engagement 
                is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious. 
                Just like Arjuna. He wanted to give up working. But Krishna would 
                not allow. Krishna said, "You are a soldier. Your business is 
                to fight, but fight for Me!" Everyone should be fully engaged. 
                In the morning hold <i>kirtana</i> and class. Then take some <i> 
                prasadam</i> and go out and work for Krishna all day long. Then 
                in the evening come back together for holding more <i>kirtana</i> 
                and class. Is there any difficulty? 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>As a consequence of Prabhupada's directions, the schedule 
              of prayer-study-work-prayer-study became the established order of 
              temple life. What is interesting about this change is its "controlled 
              quality"-its blend of behavioural transformation and theological 
              motivation. Put differently, the new behaviours are clear responses 
              to economic need, but the motivational vocabulary used to legitimise 
              the new pattern is cast in sacred terms. 
            <p><b>Charisma and Religious Leadership <br>
              </b>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada challenged the basic beliefs, 
              morals and behaviour patterns of modern culture, and did so appealing 
              to what he claimed was the older and wiser Indian religious tradition. 
              Surely he used logic and reason in his preaching of Krishna consciousness, 
              but in the final analysis, those visitors to his early temples who 
              became disciples did so because of their belief, trust and faith 
              in the teaching and personality of Prabhupada. Their willingness 
              to accept him as guru enabled them to reject their former cultural 
              lives and social identities. 
            <p align=LEFT>The powerful experience of charismatic leadership, and 
              the belief engendered by membership that the charismatic community 
              is anchored in ultimate truth and guided by divine providence, results 
              in a radical relativising of other belief systems and cultural worlds. 
              As Weber points out, charisma is always in tension with the "world". 
              Ultimate truth is understood as being located in the prophetic community 
              and revealed only through the pronouncements of the charismatic 
              prophet. Other cultures, religions and belief systems are viewed 
              as lesser ontological entities. 
            <p align=LEFT>The goals and beliefs of the charismatic community are 
              seen by believers as central for all humanity-so much so that at 
              times the conventional rules or procedures of the majority culture 
              can be legitimately circumvented for the furtherance of the group's 
              goals and programs. ISKCON, like other charismatic movements, finds 
              itself, therefore, in tension with the "world". Charisma cuts both 
              ways: it functions both to maintain commitment to the charismatic 
              group and to de-emphasise loyalty to "the world". It also enables 
              charismatic leaders to violate rules and procedures in order to 
              achieve strongly desired goals. 
            <p align=LEFT>Only a very special type of religious leader can motivate 
              followers to charismatic commitment without permitting himself or 
              the group the unbridled excesses possible with charismatic authority/commitment. 
              Prabhupada appears to have been this type of authentic charismatic 
              leader, and we can only speculate as to why this is so. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada grew up in a cultural milieu where the guru 
              and religious devotion were an accepted, taken-for-granted part 
              of everyday life. The guru in Indian culture "rightfully" expects 
              obedience and loyalty from the disciple, but, in turn, is himself 
              restrained by social, historical, and religious rules and procedures. 
              The system of disciplic succession, parampara, is an attempt to 
              wed commitment and restraint, individuality and tradition, in religious 
              interaction and teaching. Prabhupada internalised this norm, and 
              his leadership, therefore, was marked by both charismatic and traditional 
              authority. Charisma gave him the ability to innovate, to transplant 
              the Krishna tradition to America, while the traditional role of 
              guru provided structural checks and balances. 
            <p align=LEFT>Charismatic gurus evidently are not easily made. Among 
              the problems facing ISKCON after the passing of Prabhupada is the 
              difficulty of establishing authority figures in the movement who 
              are both charismatic and yet anchored fully in the Krishna tradition 
              of guruship. While many aspire to this position, there are few who 
              can effectively combine personal charisma and traditional authority. 
            <p align=LEFT>But is a cultural explanation sufficient to explain 
              Prabhupada's successful leadership? As we have shown, a charismatic 
              movement such as ISKCON comes about as a consequence of (1) the 
              presence of widespread social dissatisfaction and distress, and 
              (2) the availability of an ideology which promises relief, presented 
              by (3) a leader who, by dint of personal strengths and powers, can 
              convince those in distress that he, indeed, has a solution. Prabhupada 
              responded to those who were searching. But it was the unique confluence 
              of Prabhupada's perceived wisdom, piety and his prophetic confidence 
              that convinced these seekers that the "solution" was available. 
              Any religious message, no matter how appealing and timely, requires 
              an authentic charismatic leader who embodies that message for it 
              to be accepted by prospective followers. 
            <p align=LEFT>Most scholarly studies of charismatic movements have 
              emphasised the supposed psychological gains to be got from membership, 
              but have not considered the experience of prophetic charisma as 
              an explanatory variable itself. Studies of religious movements and 
              religious conversions, however, need to consider the experience 
              of charisma as a <i>sui generis</i> reality in religious life, akin 
              to what Rudolf Otto termed "the holy" or what Durkheim specified 
              as "the social" in <i>The Rules of Sociological Method</i>. Is it 
              not possible to acknowledge the experience of charisma as a motivating 
              force in religious movements and conversions without entirely reducing 
              this experience to psychological states or sociological categories?
