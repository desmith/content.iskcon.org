              <li><a name="1"></a>As late as 1974, in the Lausanne Covenant, Evangelical 
                Christians formally rejected the belief that God may be known 
                apart from the gospel of Jesus Christ: "We recognise that all 
                men have some knowledge of God through his general revelation 
                in nature. But we deny that this can save, for men suppress the 
                truth by their unrighteousness. We also reject as derogatory to 
                Christ and the gospel every kind of syncretism and dialogue which 
                implies that Christ speaks equally through all religions and ideologies" 
                (Shorter, 1983:179). G.C. Berkouwer, a conservative Protestant 
                theologian, looks upon extra-biblical religion not as revealed 
                but as a "depraved answer to the revelation of God" (Dulles, 1983:7). 
                (The latest and most daring Evangelical attempt to come to terms 
                with this issue has just come to my attention. In <i>The Scripture 
                Principle</i>, Clark H. Pinnock has granted that the general revelation 
                alluded to in the Bible must be saving if it comes from a saving 
                God [p.7l]. This is an encouraging step forward for Evangelical 
                theology.)<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="2"></a>For current studies of revelation by Christian 
                theologians, see Dulles, 1983; Shorter, 1983; and Abraham, 1982. 
                For a wide-ranging contemporary study of revelation in the Indian 
                traditions, see Murty, 1959. For a sophisticated philosophical 
                exploration of revelation from ninth-century India, see Jayanta 
                Bhatta's <i>Nyaya-manjari</i>, Anhika IV (1978:484-617).<br>

              <li><a name="3"></a>A good example of a dialogic, constructive theology 
                of the sort I am describing-and one that remains profoundly devotional-can 
                be found in Thomas Merton's foreword to the first edition of <i>Bhagavad-gita 
                As It Is</i> (Bhaktivedanta, 1968:18-22). A careful study of that 
                short essay will give some indication of how Christianity can 
                be enriched by its encounter with the Vaiñëavism preached by Prabhupäda 
                and ISKCON. (Also see Paul F. Knitter's recently published <i>No 
                Other Name?</i> for a daring Roman Catholic attempt to move beyond 
                Rahnerian inclusivism.)<br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="4"></a>This method immediately destroys itself, since 
                denying the usefulness of predication is itself a negative predication.<br>

                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="5"></a>Dionysius the Areopagite, or Pseudo-Dionysius, 
                was most likely a late fifth century Syrian mystic. Along with 
                his other writings, <i>The Mystical Theology</i>, in which he 
                gives expression in extremely daring form to a radical apophaticism, 
                he exerted a significant influence over subsequent mystical and 
                dogmatic theology in the Eastern and Western Churches.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="6"></a>By means of his principle of analogy, Thomas 
                (1947:I.158) is able to forcefully maintain the thesis that "the 
                name person pre-eminently belongs to God". (<i>Summa Theologica</i> 
                I.29, 4) Thomas's argument is succinct and reminiscent of a similar 
                argument that appears frequently in Prabhupada's writings. "Person", 
                writes Thomas, "signifies what is most perfect in all nature.... 
                Hence, since everything that is perfect must be attributed to 
                God, for as much as His essence contains every perfection, this 
                name person is fittingly applied to God." (ibid.) <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li><a name="7"></a>Prabhupada (Bhaktivedanta, 1973:99-100) uses 
                a form of argument similar to Thomas's <i>analogia entis</i> where 
                he states that,<br>
                <br>
                The Mayavadi philosophers cannot understand these two prakritis, 
                or natures-material and spiritual-but one who is actually intelligent 
                can understand them. Considering the many varieties and activities 
                in material nature, why should the Mayavadi philosophers deny 
                the spiritual varieties of the spiritual world? Mayavadi philosophers, 
                however, cannot clearly understand spiritual varieties; therefore 
                they imagine a negation of the material world to be the spiritual 
                world.<br>
                <br>
                The latter sentence gives an example of negative theology unchecked 
                by a positive theology. The first section of the above quotation 
                is a good example of analogical reasoning; it maintains a dialectical 
                balance between positive and negative predication. See also <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
                7.24 and Prabhupada's purport (Bhaktivedanta, 1983: 403). The 
                implication of this verse is that personality (vyaktim) cannot 
                arise from impersonality (avyaktam), since personality is of a 
                higher ontological order than impersonality.<br>

                entourage and qualities are all spiritual."<br>

                as to generate the conditions necessary to human life. This view 
                is opposed to the more traditional view that life emerged as an

              <li><a name="13"></a>The following summary description of Goloka 
                Vrindavana may be found in <i>Teachings of Lord Chaitanya</i> 
                (Bhaktivedanta, 1974:321): <br>
                <br>
                In Brahma-samhita the transcendental land of Vrindavana is described 
                as being always spiritual. That spiritual land is populated by 
                goddesses of fortune, who are known as gopis. These are all beloved 
                of Krishna and Krishna is the only lover of all these gopis. The 
                trees of that land are kalpa-vriksha, wish-fulfilling trees, and 
                one can have anything he wants from them. The land is made of 
                touchstone and water of nectar. In that land all speech is song, 
                and all walking is dancing, and one's constant companion is the 
                flute. Everything is self-luminous, just like the sun in this 
                material world. The human form of life is meant for understanding 
                this transcendental land of Vrindavana, and one who is fortunate 
                should cultivate knowledge of Vrindavana and its residents. In 
                that supreme abode are surabhi cows that overflood the land with 
                milk. Since not even a moment there is misused, there is no past, 
                present or future. An expansion of this Vrindavana, which is the 
                supreme abode of Krishna, is also present on this earth, and superior 
                devotees worship it as the supreme abode. [i.e., Gokula Vrindavana, 
                the Vrindavana that is in India, the earthly location of many 
                of Krishna's terrestrial pastimes].<br>
                <br>
                This description of the perfections of Goloka Våndävana calls 
                to mind Thomas's theory of super-eminence: God is the super-eminent 
                source of all perfections that are imperfectly experienced in 
                this finite, sin-blasted world. "God prepossesses in Himself", 
                writes Thomas, "all the perfections of creatures. Being Himself 
                absolutely and universally perfect..." (<i>Summa Theologica</i> 
                I.13, 2 Thomas Aquinas, 1948:101) "Hence, it is necessary that 
                whatever is found to act in anything whatever must be found in 
                God in a more eminent way than in the thing itself." (<i>Summa 
                Contra Gentiles</i>, I.28, 7 Thomas Aquinas, 1975:1361)</li>

                writes that Eastern religions are not overtly revelational since 
                they do not claim to be based on divine revelation. He generously 
                allows for the possibility that these non-Biblical religions might 
                contain enough revelation to bring about the condemnation of their 
                followers.</li>
