            <p><i>Aravind Sharma tackles an interesting subject here, analysing 
              and comparing the development of early Christianity, Buddhism and 
              Islam with the development of ISKCON. He establishes that while 
              an anthropological perspective is no doubt helpful in reviewing 
              the patterns of interaction between New Religious Movements, Traditional 
              Religion and Social Institutions, such a perspective needs to be 
              supplemented by some other perspectives as well, if we are to avoid 
              the danger of drawing partial and potentially misleading conclusions. 
              He ends by suggesting some of the perspectives which may be considered 
              useful in broadening the current approach to study of ISKCON. </i> 
            <p><b>Through the Looking Glass<br>
              </b>Astronomers tell us that one is able to peer deeper into space 
              with an averted gaze (which must be distinguished carefully from 
              a sidelong glance, by the way) than by trying to peer into it straight, 
              as it were. I realise that this observation is counter-intuitive, 
              but I have been assured that the observation, appearances to the 
              contrary notwithstanding, is correct. This provides a new dimension 
              to the question of methodology in the scientific study of religion. 
              To the extent that the study of religion, and the study of New Religious 
              Movements, tries to emulate the scientific method, the above-mentioned 
              observation seems to suggest a remarkable epistemology: that it 
              may be possible to gain a deeper insight into our topic of investigation 
              by not looking at it at all! And that one should reach such a conclusion, 
              not through post-modernism, but through a field of enquiry so quintessentially 
              scientific as astronomy, does boggle the mind. But I digress. 
            <p>I would like to examine the possibility today that we may learn 
              more about the Hare Krishna movement as an example of the interaction 
              between a New Religious Movement, Traditional Religion and Social 
              Institutions by not talking about the Hare Krishna movement at all, 
              but rather about cabbages and kings in the manner of <i>Alice in 
              Wonderland</i>. So please bear with me awhile as I pursue this new 
              hermeneutical path into the world of the sacred, a path which, to 
              begin with, looks more like a detour than a path, or a royal path, 
              or even the straight and narrow path, but we have it on good authority 
              that it may well be the best path. 
            <p><b>Old &quot;New&quot; Religious Movements<br>
              </b>Let us begin by considering or treating the rise of early Buddhism 
              as a New Religious Movement of the times within the overall context 
              of Hinduism. Let us then also ask of it the question: What form 
              of institutionalisation resulted within the social matrix as a result 
              of the interplay of Hinduism as a Traditional Religion, with Buddhism 
              as a New Religious Movement? I think the answer to this intriguing 
              question has to be that the emergence of the Buddhist monastic order 
              known as the Sangha, or at least the firm establishment thereof, 
              may be attributed to the rise of Buddhism. It may be important to 
              point out that eremetic, as distinguished from coenobitic monasticism, 
              was already known to Hinduism; and that even coenobitic monasticism, 
              in a somewhat rudimentary form, had probably made its appearance 
              within Jainism by this point. With reference to Hinduism, then, 
              the difference was one of <i>form,</i> while in reference to Jainism 
              the difference was one of <i>scale</i>. In this case, then, the 
              emergence of the Buddhist Sangha provides an illustration of the 
              outcome that might result from the interaction between a New Religious 
              Movement, a Traditional Religion and Social Institutions. 
            <p>I would like to turn next to the emergence of Christianity as a 
              New Religious Movement in the context of Judaism, and ask a similar 
              question: What form of institutionalisation resulted within the 
              social matrix as a result of the interplay of Judaism as a Traditional 
              Religion with Christianity as a New Religious Movement? I think 
              the answer to this question has to be that the interaction between 
              Christianity as a New Religious Movement and Judaism as a Traditional 
              Religion in the social context of the times gave rise to the Christian 
              Ecclesia. 
            <p>If we then turn our attention to Islam and consider it as a New 
              Religious Movement which arose in the context of the Traditional 
              Religion of Arabia, posing our question once more: What form of 
              institutionalisation resulted within the social matrix as a result 
              of the interplay of the Pre-Islamic Traditional Religion of Arabia 
              with the New Religious Movement of Islam, I think the answer has 
              to be that it was the formation of the Islamic Umma. 
            <p><b>Comparisons with the Hare Krishna Movement <br>
              </b>If the Sangha, the Ecclesia and the Umma are studied as three 
              outcomes illustrative of the interaction between a New Religious 
              Movement, Traditional Religion and Social Institutions, and then 
              compared with the Hare Krishna movement, some interesting conclusions 
              seem to emerge: 
            <p>All these three institutions arose within the context of a missionary 
              religion attempting to move away from the primarily ethnic orientation 
              of the Traditional Religion. This is also true of the Hare Krishna 
              movement. 
            <p>Except for Christianity, the spiritual leadership of the community 
              was left in the hands of the community, after the passing away of 
              the founding figure. In this case, the Hare Krishna movement followed 
              the Christian model. 
            <p>The more developed the Traditional Religion (the parent religion 
              in these cases), the more of a mark it left on the succeeding religion. 
              Islam was perhaps the least influenced in this respect. The Hare 
              Krishna movement is thus closer to Buddhism and Christianity in 
              this respect. 
            <p>Out of the three - the Sangha, the Ecclesia and the Umma - each 
              was successively (and often progressively more successfully) involved 
              with the state. In this respect the Hare Krishna movement represents 
              a point of departure. Although, like the early Christian church, 
              it may have arisen in opposition to the dominant state religion, 
              it never succeeded in becoming the state religion either in India 
              nor anywhere in the West. Opposition by the state in its initial 
              phase, both in India and the West, seems to provide a curious parallel 
              of sorts with Christianity. 
            <p>It is also a point worth noting that the social unit associated 
              with each religion - namely, the Buddhist Sangha, the Christian 
              Ecclesia and the Islamic Umma - represented increasingly larger 
              social organisations. At the same time, however, the largest (the 
              Umma) dispensed with the more limited formal structures of governance 
              that one finds within Buddhism, and especially Christianity. Thus, 
              Islam does away with the institution of the priesthood altogether, 
              although it has been persuasively suggested that the ulama may be 
              looked upon as playing a somewhat analogous role. 
            <p>These three religions, when viewed as New Religious Movements, 
              were also initially viewed as <i>counter-cultural </i>in nature 
              until becoming established religions. This happened when they either 
              became recognised by the state, or themselves became state religions. 
              This process took the least time in the case of Islam. 
            <p><b>Counter-Cultural Setting<br>
              </b>This might seem like a somewhat dissociated account, but I have 
              tried to arrive by degrees at my point, which is that whether a 
              New Religious Movement succeeds in becoming an established religion 
              has a profound bearing on the issue of its social organisation. 
              What I hope rescues this comment from being merely commonplace is 
              the implication that so long as a New Religious Movement remains 
              a counter-culture, its social organisation must respond to meet 
              the needs of its members as members of a counter-culture. At this 
              stage of the game this clearly is the case with the Hare Krishna 
              movement, which, incidentally, has found itself in this counter-cultural 
              setting in relation to both Islam and Christianity, and perhaps 
              even in relation to Hinduism so far. 
            <p><b>Revitalisation Movements<br>
              </b>I will now like to factor the social dimension into the discussion 
              more systematically, using as my point of entry the remarks made 
              by Charles R. Brooks on Hare Krishna in the context of revitalisation 
              movements. He writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>Understanding ISKCON'S historical emergence from an anthropological 
                viewpoint can be better achieved by observing how closely it fits 
                Anthony Wallace's model of the &quot;Revitalisation Movement&quot;. 
                A Revitalisation movement is a conscious, organised effort by 
                people who are so dissatisfied with their culture that they desire 
                to create a more satisfying one. Such socio-cultural phenomena 
                have appeared throughout history when cultures go through periods 
                of disorganisation and failure. When a culture ceases to function 
                for some people, those people begin to experience a high degree 
                of distress and actively seek to find new ways of thinking and 
                behaving. As more and more people experience this condition, a 
                period of &quot;cultural distortion&quot; can be said to exist. 
                Individuals begin to recognise others with similar problems, and 
                a loose sense of community begins to form among them. (1995; 78-79) 
            </ul>
            <p>Charles R. Brooks then proceeds to explain the Hare Krishna phenomenon 
              in terms of this model as follows: 
            <ul>
              <p>This was the situation in the late 1960s and early 1970s when 
                a counter-culture formed in the United States and Western Europe. 
                Such conditions are optimal for the formation of revitalisation 
                movements, and they may or may not form depending on whether a 
                charismatic leader or prophet appears. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami 
                arrived in the United States at the time, although he was personally 
                unaware of these conditions. And he provided the charismatic leadership 
                and direction around which a new culture and society - ISKCON 
                - formed. ISKCON is a classic revitalisation movement in the American 
                context. <i>So was the early Christian Church. as well as early 
                forms of Buddhism and Islam</i>. (1995; 79, my italics) 
            </ul>
            <p>I apologise for this somewhat extended citation but it is a necessary 
              preamble to my own conclusion. You doubtless noticed how Brooks 
              has also made reference to the cases of Christianity, Buddhism and 
              Islam in presenting his conclusion. While I am inclined to agree 
              with what he has to say in a general way, I want to supplement his 
              conclusion in two major ways. This may have the implication of modifying 
              his conclusion somewhat. 
            <p><b>Who Is Revitalising Whom?<br>
              </b>The first point I would like to make is that the revitalisation 
              thesis, as presented here, assigns too passive a role to the Hare 
              Krishna movement itself. The image his remarks conjure is that of 
              a ripe field into which the seed of Hare Krishna happened to fall 
              and bear fruit. Instead of merely being a product of this counter-cultural 
              ferment, the presence of the Hare Krishna movement should also be 
              considered as a contributory factor. I dare suggest that this consideration 
              might be even more significant in the context of early Christianity, 
              Buddhism and Islam. 
            <p>I would like to make my second point by posing the following question: 
              Whose revitalisation are we talking about? Wallace seems to depict 
              the ferment occurring within the culture under consideration. However, 
              is not something important being overlooked here, such as ferment 
              within the culture from which the Hare Krishna movement was transplanted 
              to North America? Unlike Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, which 
              emerged from within the very society in which they took root, Hare 
              Krishna as a movement arose elsewhere, and then made its passage 
              to its host society. This indicates that what revitalised it to 
              make the journey to North America from India is as important an 
              element in the equation as what enabled it to become a revitalisation 
              movement upon arriving in North America. 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>My conclusion then is that while an anthropological perceptive 
              is no doubt helpful in reviewing the patterns of interaction between 
              New Religious Movements, Traditional Religion and Social Institutions, 
              such a perspective needs to be supplemented by other perspectives 
              as well if we are to avoid the danger of drawing partial (and potentially 
              misleading) conclusions, especially in the case of the Hare Krishna 
              movement. I would like extend the discussion to include the following 
              considerations: 
            <p>From a historical perspective, a distinction may perhaps be usefully 
              drawn, in the light of the foregoing analysis between counter-culture 
              and what I would like to call encounter-culture (or, more properly, 
              cultural encounter). While for the Westerners the Hare Krishna movement 
              may have appeared as a counter-culture, for the Indians it was also 
              as much a case, if not more, of encounter-culture - that is to say, 
              of encountering another culture in which they were spreading their 
              own. 
            <p>From a phenomenological perspective, it might be helpful to enquire 
              about the attitude of the participants themselves. Would they not, 
              for instance, explain their success differently, and more in terms 
              of the traditional culture whose elements were still present in 
              their culture? It could well be that at least part of their success 
              is to be accounted for by the fact that they were perceived as a 
              counter-culture. But did the members perceive it in the same way? 
              Its appeal in terms of counter-culture is our way of explaining 
              their success. But did they perceive it that way? Did Prabhupäda 
              think in those terms? Would he not attribute his success to the 
              will of Krishna, just as the Prophet attributed his to the will 
              of God? This last point, I hope, helps make the point that historical 
              analysis is a two-way street; the past helps us understand the present 
              better, and it may also work the other way around. 
            <p>From a sociological perspective, one might feel concerned about 
              the danger of over aggregation, in using the counter-culture to 
              explain more than it might reasonably be expected to. For instance, 
              new social institutions may result from societal responses to needs 
              other than merely counter-cultural. The social unit might be facing 
              a different kind of need, such as that for social cohesion, or territorial 
              expansion, for instance. 
            <p>To conclude then, while the explanation in terms of counter-culture 
              is important, it may also be incomplete.
