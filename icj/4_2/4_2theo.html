              Rose</a> 
            <p><i>Kenneth Rose is in a good position to help us understand what 
              ISKCON has to offer Christianity in terms of theology. He is a scholar 
              and has been a student of both Vaishnavism and Christianity. Consequently 
              his observations here give us valuable perspectives on the Vaishnava 
              theology and some ways in which members of the Christian community 
              can use it to enhance their understanding of cited theological issues. 
              It will also serve as a useful tool for devotees to examine Vaishnava 
              theology from a Christian point of view.</i> 
            <p>In the summer of 1970, I entered ISKCON as a disillusioned nineteen 
              year-old Roman Catholic seeking to deepen my devotion to God, to 
              Krishna. I remained in the Krishna consciousness movement a year 
              and a half and was initiated by Shrila Prabhupada. I left the movement 
              at the beginning of 1972 in order to fully commit myself to the 
              practice and study of Christianity. It is from this perspective 
              that I approach the question: "Has ISKCON anything to offer Christianity 
              in theological terms?" 
            <p>My central theological interest is the construction of a global 
              systematic, or dogmatic, theology out of the diverse materials of 
              the religious traditions of the world. God, I believe, is the source 
              of these traditions, yet the knowledge of God and of God's saving 
              activities is not exhausted by these traditions. For this reason, 
              I believe that an adequate theology must be global; it must be a 
              sustained and universally receptive effort of what Gordon D. Kaufman 
              (1981:12) has called "constructing toward God". 
            <p>My theological position is itself an attempt toward such construction. 
              My essentially orthodox Christian theological outlook, nurtured 
              by both Roman Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism, has, over 
              the years, been challenged to critical reformulation by the lingering 
              influence of my intensive experience as an American Vaishnava. Although 
              I left ISKCON fourteen years ago, some of the central images and 
              doctrines of Gaudiya Vaishnavism it propagates still remain as lively 
              theological truths for me. It is these elements of Vaishnavism, 
              above all other factors that have prevented me from remaining a 
              traditionally orthodox Christian. The formative influence upon me 
              of the vibrant piety of ISKCON has for a long time challenged me 
              to attempt the construction of a dogmatic theology that is sensitive 
              to both traditional Christian piety and Vaishnava <i>bhakti.</i> 
              In attempting in the following pages to answer the question that 
              has been assigned to me, I will take a preliminary step toward global 
              dogmatic construction that is sensitive to what the Vaishnavism 
              of ISKCON has to offer to Christianity theologically with respect 
              to three central theological categories: Revelation, God, and Eschatology. 
            <p><b>Revelation<br>
              </b>With the exception of Evangelical Protestantism,<a href="4_2theofoot.html#1">1</a> 
              Christian openness to other religions has steadily increased over 
              the course of the past century. The arrogance that allowed Monier 
              Monier-Williams (1890:185) to assert in the late nineteenth century 
              that the people of India will find "in Christianity alone their 
              true home" has become muted. Among mainstream Protestants the quaint 
              claim made by Rudolf Otto in 1930 (p.104) that "Christianity is 
              the religion of the conscience per substantiam, <i>bhakti</i>-religion 
              that religion per accidens" would be indulged with a wry scepticism. 
              And the charges brought against the worship of Krishna in 1915 by 
              Nicol MacNicol (1968:264) that it is "incurably idolatrous", "sensuous", 
              "nature-worship", "lacking a content of revelation", would be discounted 
              as the tendentious misjudgements of a missionary propagandist. 
            <p>In place of these dated opinions, contemporary liberal Protestants 
              might adduce more enlightened sentiments. For example, a current 
              Protestant student of the Shri Vaishnava tradition, John Carman, 
              believes that because of the deep similarity of the Christian and 
              Shri Vaishnava traditions with respect to the tension between God's 
              sovereignty and accessibility, Christians are able to appreciate 
              the writings of Shri Vaishnavism's outstanding theologian, Ramanuja. 
              And so, in place of the missionary triumphalism that marred earlier 
              Christian explorations of Vaishnavism, Professor Carman (1974:271), 
              in a gracious display of Christian humility, closes his book on 
              Ramanuja by suggesting that the "significance of this understanding 
              poses an important and as yet unresolved question for Christian 
              theology". For me, this unresolved question takes the form: What 
              can Christian theology learn from Vaishnavism in general and from 
              ISKCON in particular? 
            <p>Despite the openness of mainstream Christianity to other religious 
              traditions, a residue of exclusivism remains. This is evident in 
              a recent book by a Roman Catholic theologian, Aylward Shorter, in 
              which an expansive generosity toward non-Christian religions is 
              given expression. "There is no doubt", writes Shorter (1983:172), 
              "about the current teaching of the Catholic Church that God's universal 
              salvific will is effective and that every human being is given a 
              chance of salvation. Grace is offered to all." Shorter quickly points 
              out, however, that this universal opportunity for salvation is predicated 
              upon the saving death of Jesus Christ, as the Vatican II document 
              <i>Gaudium Et Spes</i> proclaims. It was the linking of the notion 
              of universal opportunity for salvation with that of Christ's own 
              redemptive work that earlier gave rise to Rahner's (197S:214) theory 
              of "anonymous Christians". The logical contortions evident in this 
              concept are indicative of a desire not only to generously include 
              all human beings within God's saving providence but also of a desire 
              to maintain the decisive primacy of the Christian revelation. 
            <p>Despite the latitudinarianism of Rahner's and Shorter's position, 
              it is still ultimately a Christ- centred exclusivism and it seems 
              incapable of becoming broad enough to fully appreciate that the 
              irenic exclusivism it exemplifies is also a feature of some non-Christian 
              religions and of ISKCON Vaishnavism in particular. For example, 
              where some irenic Christian might assert that ultimately all redemption, 
              including that which is discovered through non-Christian religions, 
              is made possible by Christ; Prabhupada, following the <i> Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              (4.8), would trace all salvation to Shri Krishna, who is "the fountainhead 
              of all <i>avatars</i>" (Bhaktivedanta, 1983:229). And contrary to 
              the Christian belief that the Biblical record affords the deepest 
              insight into the divine truth available to humanity, Prabhupada 
              (ibid.:36) claims that, 
            <ul>
              <p>One will find in the Bhagavad-gita all that is contained in other 
                scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not 
                to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gita. 
                It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken 
                by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Shri Krishna. 
            </ul>
            <p>On the basis of these and many other passages in Prabhupada's writings, 
              it is quite conceivable that in dealing with the problem of other 
              religious traditions, some Vaishnava theologian might begin speaking 
              of the devout of other faiths as "anonymous Vaishnavas". Something 
              like this is implicit, in fact, in Prabhupada's frequently repeated 
              claim that all creatures, whether or not they acknowledge it, are 
              eternal servitors of Lord Krishna (Bhaktivedanta, 1974:55). 
            <p>In the face of this ISKCON Vaishnava claim to ultimacy for Krishna 
              and His revelation, three courses of thought and action are open 
              for Christian theology: We can repress the Vaishnava claim to ultimacy; 
              we can acquiesce in it and become disciples of Krishna's representatives; 
              or we can attempt the construction of a systematic theology that 
              will, on the basis of these two ultimates, Christianity and Vaishnavism, 
              articulate the essential doctrines of a general theism that endeavours 
              to coherently explicate the theological insights contained in these 
              two diverse and equally rich and philosophically defensible revelation 
              traditions.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#2">2</a> 
            <p>To take the first alternative, repression, would be a futile, unreasonable 
              course, for it simply denies what is obvious: the self-sufficiency 
              of a non-Christian religion to abide faithfully in the presence 
              of a redeeming, self-revealing God of love. The second alternative, 
              acquiescence, seems unlikely, for just as Vaishnavism has a rich 
              heritage of revelation and devout practice to lovingly maintain 
              and proclaim, so does Christianity. It is for these reasons that 
              I have decided on the third alternative, that of learning from one 
              another about the ways of God in our respective traditions. Beginning 
              with our very different revelation traditions, we can start constructing 
              a general theological picture of reality that may be more adequate 
              theoretically than that which is provided by either tradition on 
              its own. But to do this demands the humility that recognises that 
              God may have spoken, through a tradition alien to ours, truths that 
              can supplement what God has spoken in our own tradition. If this 
              were all that Christianity were to learn in its encounter with ISKCON, 
              that would be valuable and significant. But, as the following discussion 
              will attempt to show, there is much more than this to be learned 
              by Christianity in its encounter with ISKCON.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#3">3</a> 
            <p><b>God<br>
              </b>Carl Raschke, a theologian attempting to apply the deconstruction 
              of Derrida to theological discourse, asserts (Altizer, Myers, <i>et. 
              al.</i>, 1982:4) that "neither language nor human self-awareness 
              conceals any thread of reference to things as they are." Basically, 
              Raschke is denying predication, that which makes thought and language 
              possible (Peukert, 1984:131-132). This extreme negation of the capacity 
              of discourse to capture in concepts and words features of extra-subjective 
              reality is hermeneutical nihilism. It implies not only the undermining 
              of the persistent regularities that ground science and philosophy, 
              but also of those that ground theology.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#4">4</a> 
            <p>Despite the sensation of novelty that attends deconstruction, it 
              is not essentially a new method; indeed, it seems to me to be just 
              a reformulation of the apophatic, or negative, method in theology 
              and philosophy. In <i>Dionysius the Areopagite</i>,<a href="4_2theofoot.html#5">5</a> 
              for example, the negative method of theology is pushed to the extreme 
              in the denial that the predicative capacity of discourse can be 
              applied successfully to God. The result of this radical apophaticism 
              is that knowledge of God is thought to be forever beyond the reach 
              of reason. Such a negative tendency, if it is not dialectically 
              checked by a cataphatic, or positive, method in which the capacity 
              of thought and language to at- tain to knowledge of God is maintained, 
              foretells the ultimate destruction of theism. 
            <p>In the West, the most sublime dialectical balance between apophatic 
              and cataphatic theologies was achieved by St. Thomas Aquinas. Because 
              human beings, in Thomas's view, are related to God as effects to 
              their cause, whatever perfections are to be found in human beings 
              must pre-exist super-excellently in God. Consequently, human discourse 
              about the perfections of human existence, personality, goodness 
              and so forth, must in some degree be predicable of God. On this 
              view the extremes of either a purely negative or a purely positive 
              theology are ruled out. Theological discourse must be a mean between 
              these two methods. In other words, knowledge of God is based on 
              the belief that the being of God is like, yet unlike, that of human 
              beings.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#6">6</a> This mediating method 
              is a form of analogical reasoning (<i> Summa Theologica</i>, I.13, 
              5). 
            <p>In the East, a formally similar dialectical balance between the 
              apophatic and the cataphatic approaches was achieved by Shri Chaitanya 
              in his doctrine of <i>acintya-bhedäbheda</i>. Against the extreme 
              monism of the Advaita-vadins (which, like Dionysius's apophaticism 
              and deconstruction, involves an ultimate negation of predication 
              [Kar, 1978:105]), Chaitanya argued for the inconceivable, simultaneous 
              oneness and difference of Krishna and finite creatures. In this 
              view, we are one with Krishna insofar as we participate in Krishna's 
              being, but we are different from Krishna insofar as we do so only 
              finitely, and hence imperfectly. 
            <p>The similarity of Chaitanya's principle of <i>acintya-bhedäbheda</i> 
              and Thomas's principle of analogy will seem remarkable only if it 
              is not understood that this logical similarity is a function of 
              the logic of theism itself. Any theism that does not suppose that 
              whatever perfections exist in creatures must first exist in their 
              fullness in the Creator is logically incoherent. 
            <p>It is precisely at this point that ISKCON can be of service to 
              liberal Protestant theology, for the lingering fideism and biblicism 
              of post-Barthian theology is still the source among liberal Protestants 
              of a suspicion of philosophical theology of the sort pursued by 
              Thomas. Consequently, among liberal Protestants the notion of a 
              personal God has the status more of a mere affirmation of faith 
              than of a rationally justifiable metaphysical truth. But a theism 
              of this sort is, in Prabhupada's view, nothing more than sentimentalism. 
            <p>The theism preached by ISKCON is, on the contrary, not a sentimental 
              affirmation but a logical implication of the metaphysical axiom 
              of inconceivable, simultaneous likeness and unlikeness. Consequently, 
              it can offer a powerful logical defence against all forms of theological 
              scepticism, whether derived from Derrida, Dionysius, or Shankara. 
              For these just-named thinkers, the formlessness of ultimate reality 
              provides no foundation for form; to speak, therefore, about the 
              personality of God, from this perspective, is ultimately to speak 
              nonsense. A disastrous problem, however, is generated by this view: 
              How, even as illusion, can the experience of form arise if there 
              is absolutely no ground for it in reality? Chaitanya Vaishnavism 
              avoids this problem because it argues, contrary to the above-stated 
              impersonalist view, that if any finite entity possesses personality, 
              it does so because it derives this attribute from its original cause, 
              the all-attractive reservoir of all perfections, Lord Shri Krishna.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#7">7</a> 
            <p>&nbsp;In bringing us to this point, Prabhupada has brought us as 
              far as Thomas had brought theology in a more philosophically acute 
              age. Christian theology would do well to examine the rational foundations 
              of theism as set forth by Vaishnavism, for not only will it enable 
              us to restore a neglected element of our tradition, but it can also 
              help us probe into an area avoided by Christian theology. I am referring 
              to the notion that God possesses an eternal form, a spiritual body.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#8">8</a> 
              Thomas outright rejects this notion on the grounds that it represents 
              the projection by the imagination of corporeal form upon the incorporeal 
              (<i>Samma Contra Gentiles</i>, I.20, 37). Actually, this rejection 
              seems to violate the principles of analogy central to Thomas's thought, 
              for if creatures have personality in virtue of God's personality, 
              on what grounds will it be denied that this reasoning can be extended 
              to also conclude that creatures possess bodies in virtue of God's 
              possessing a body? 
            <p>To those of us who have been nurtured within cultures shaped by 
              the Bible, such reasoning is shocking and would likely be dismissed 
              as childish nonsense.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#9">9</a> If, however, 
              on the basis of something like the anthropic principle in astronomical 
              cosmology,<a href="4_2theofoot.html#10">10</a> we were to understand 
              universal evolution as intending the specific conditions necessary 
              for human existence, then the notion that the human form is a material 
              attempt to reflect the spiritual body of the ultimate personality, 
              God, seems less nonsensical. Even from the standpoint of the Biblical 
              writings, this idea cannot be dismissed, for, according to the apostle 
              Paul, the destiny of the Christian is resurrection to a future life 
              in a spiritual body that will be fashioned after the model of the 
              "reanimated and glorified body of Jesus" (Wilhelm Pesch in Bauer, 
              1981:84). <a href="4_2theofoot.html#11">11</a> 
            <p>The result of this preliminary study of the doctrine of God is, 
              I believe, the discovery that ISKCON can help Christian theology 
              to recover the metaphysical basis of theism and to enrich its understanding 
              of embodiment. 
            <p><b>Eschatology<br>
              </b>Above my desk at home are two prints. One of them, in a display 
              of traditional Roman Catholic piety, depicts Jesus in agony upon 
              the cross. Winged angels are collecting in golden chalices the saving 
              blood flowing from his spiked hands. Mary Magdalen, crowned with 
              a golden halo, is soaking a white cloth in the precious blood flowing 
              from his spiked feet. It is a moment of supreme agony. Above this 
              print, I have placed another one; it is one of the earliest and 
              finest examples of the work of ISKCON's illustrators. Beneath a 
              tree alive with exotic birds, in a verdant field decorated with 
              wildflowers, and surrounded by placid peacocks, swans, and surabhi 
              cows, stand Radha and Krishna in loving embrace. It is a moment 
              of gracious delight. 
            <p>When asked by friends why I have these prints placed on the wall 
              like this, I explain that it is through the perpetual conversion 
              of taking up our cross that we may begin to enter into the resurrection 
              life in which all creatures will experience the perfection of personal 
              and social fulfilment in the loving play of God. To my way of thinking, 
              the cross is the way to the eternal kingdom of God, and the images 
              provided by ISKCON of Krishna at play on His spiritual planet, Goloka 
              Vrindavana, are the most suggestive intimations available to us 
              of what God's kingdom will be like. Let me elaborate on this theme. 
            <p>The resurrection of Jesus Christ is an emblem of hope. It is one 
              of the most vital religious truths available to human beings, who 
              are in all ways marked by limitation and death. It assures us that 
              the deepest desires of our hearts for fulfilment, justice, healing, 
              understanding and love will not be finally and irrevocably defeated 
              by non-being. 
            <p>The Bible, however, gives only the scantiest picture of the kind 
              of life that awaits those who are raised from the dead to dwell 
              in the new Jerusalem.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#12">12</a> And so 
              my imagination is always leaping ahead of the spare Biblical vision 
              of the resurrection life. In this leaping, my imagination and hope 
              are aided by the rich pageantry of the pastimes in heavenly Vrindavana 
              of Radha and Krishna and Their loving and playful entourage of friends 
              and family. One of the most useful services that ISKCON, in its 
              propagation of Chaitanya Vaishnavism, can render to Christian faith, 
              hope and knowledge is its providing rich emblems of the resurrection.<a
 href="4_2theofoot.html#13">13</a> It can help us to visualise the perfection 
              of personal spiritual existence that is God's promised restitution 
              to a creation that has been marred by sin and death. 
            <p>It is evident that no religious teaching that solves the problem 
              of suffering by denying the ultimacy of personality can be a satisfactory 
              or just answer to this problem. The human heart, both collective 
              and individual, cries out not for the annihilation of hope but for 
              its fulfilment. In his ardent defence of a personal God and of the 
              persistence of the individual even in the state of liberation, Prabhupada 
              speaks powerfully to our hope of ultimate fulfilment beyond death. 
              This fulfilment is not a private self-gratification, but is the 
              bodying forth of the deepest hope of humankind: to live in peace 
              and justice in a community centred upon the bountiful source of 
              all that is good. 
            <p>The emblem<a href="4_2theofoot.html#14">14</a> of Goloka Vrindävana 
              is a revelation that God's power to make a world is not exhausted 
              in the making of this material universe in which limitation and 
              death are supreme. It tells us that God is able to bring us into 
              a spiritual realm not marked by death and sin, where the Biblical 
              promise "God shall wipe away all tears" (Rev. 21:4, K JV) shall 
              be made good by the rasadi-vilasi (Chaitanya-Charitamrita, Adi-Lila 
              7.8), "enjoyer of the rasa dance". 
            <p><b>Other Topics of Importance<br>
              </b>The above discussion offers only an introductory glimpse into 
              the possibilities of enrichment offered to Christian theology through 
              a serious encounter with Chaitanyite Vaishnavism. Just as a great 
              deal more remains to be said concerning the above theological categories 
              vis-à-vis the two traditions, so also the dialogue between Vaishnavism 
              and Christianity needs to be pursued further with respect to various 
              theoretical and practical issues of concern to both traditions. 
            <p>One issue of particular interest to Vaiñëavas, for whom orthopraxis 
              is prior to orthodoxy, is that of vegetarianism. The practice of 
              ahimsa (nonviolence) with respect to animals is central to ISKCON's 
              ethical life. ISKCON devotees find the meat-eating of Christians 
              to be a stumbling block in the path of dialogue more serious than 
              any theological issue. 
            <p>Christians, for the most part, find this issue to be of minimal 
              importance. I am of the opinion that Christians have much to learn 
              from Krishna's devotees on this issue. Christians can learn, without 
              danger of pantheism, to cherish non-human life as also sharing in 
              some way in the divine life. To learn this might deepen the dormant 
              Christian reverence for nature. (For greater detail on this issue 
              see my article "The Lion Shall Eat Straw Like the Ox: The Bible 
              and Vegetarianism" [Rose, 1984].) 
            <p>Another issue of great importance concerns the stages of relationality 
              between the soul and God. The writings of such mystics and mystical 
              writers as Jan Van Ruysbroeck, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa 
              of Avila, and A. Poulain reveal the rich possibilities, within Christian 
              experience, for intimate and diverse relationships with God, leading 
              up even to the mystical marriage of the soul and God. 
            <p>These possibilities, nevertheless, seem to have dropped out of 
              the experience and conceptuality of contemporary Christians. Chaitanya 
              Vaishnavism, on the contrary, has maintained as its central object 
              of contemplative practise the discovery of the individual soul's 
              particular relationship with Krishna. Love for Krishna may develop 
              in accordance with five basic rasas, or relationships: Krishna may 
              be approached as the all-powerful Supreme Brahman, as master, as 
              friend, as child or as lover. 
            <p>While this conceptuality may seem odd to the Christian at first 
              glance, it has great humanising power, for in upholding the just-named 
              varieties of devotion to God (especially the last four), Vaishnavism 
              asserts the utterly personal character of the divine-human relationship, 
              for what personalism could be content to dispense with these basic 
              relationships that constitute personal existence? 
            <p>Christian personalism, therefore, can be enriched through encounter 
              with the variegated and highly articulated conception of the divine-human 
              personal relation elaborated by Chaitanya Vaishnavism. Perhaps Christians 
              might even be moved to devoutly study the Christian classics of 
              personalistic mysticism with an eye to the remedying of the current 
              imbalance of Christian experience in the direction, on the one hand, 
              of political and social activism without contemplation and, on the 
              other, toward a relation to God that centres on God almost exclusively 
              as saving Lord and occasionally rises toward friendship. 
            <p><b>Conclusion<br>
              </b>In Vaishnavism, we who are Christians can discover a tradition, 
              no less vivid and profound than Christianity, in which an absolute 
              Providence is experienced in a variety of personal relationships, 
              all of which are designed to restore to perfect loving fellowship 
              in a blessed society those who respond to God's loving initiatives 
              toward us. This discovery should persuade us to lay aside our proud 
              and false claim of having, along with Judaism, the only direct historical 
              and scriptural relationship with God.<a href="4_2theofoot.html#15">15</a> 
              The consequence of this divestiture need not be a scepticism that 
              doubts the very possibility of revelation; on the contrary, the 
              outcome should be that we will come to see that the Jewish-Christian 
              history of salvation is an important strand in the garment of universal 
              redemption, that God is weaving a garment that needs the contributions 
              of Vaishnavism, as much as it requires the contributions of Christianity. 
              This, I believe, is the most important lesson that Christianity 
              can learn from Vaishnavism and its Western representative, ISKCON.
