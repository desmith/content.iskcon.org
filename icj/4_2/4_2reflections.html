              D. Shinn</a> 
            <p><i>As this is the centenary year of Shrila Prabhupada's birth (ISKCON's 
              founder and acarya), we have decided to print a number of articles 
              about Shrila Prabhupada's work. The following article by Larry Shinn 
              provides us with an examination of Shrila Prabhupada as a mahatma, 
              his faith in the Lord, his sadhana, his erudition and his role in 
              the tradition. Significantly, it also explains the value of his 
              profound teaching by his personal example and how it cannot be imitated 
              by his followers. Shinn argues, consistent with everything Shrila 
              Prabhupada stood for, that the standards of personal devotion and 
              sädhana set by ISKCON's founder-acärya must be met by any member 
              who wants to inherit the kind of spiritual authority he possessed; 
              the position of guru is not befitting those unable to follow in 
              the footsteps of the previous acäryas as acärya means one who teaches 
              by example.</i> 
            <p>In India, the term <i>mahatma,</i> or &quot;great-souled one&quot;, 
              is reserved for the exceptional person whose integrity as a religious, 
              or even political, leader stems from an inner purity or spirituality 
              that is expressed in all of their actions. When a person exhibits 
              an extraordinary piety reflecting a basic fidelity between their 
              daily actions and their religious claims, they are considered &quot;great-souled&quot;. 
              Such was the case with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was often called 
              simply &quot;The Mahatma&quot;. Allowing for the obvious idiosyncrasies 
              and failings of all humans, Gandhi was an exceptional proponent 
              of non-violence who remained a public leader in South Africa and 
              India for more than fifty years because of his personal and spiritual 
              integrity in living a non-violent life. When a person with such 
              spiritual power and personal integrity exercises influence over 
              a large number of people, they are popularly called &quot;charismatic&quot;. 
              Such also was the case with Gandhi. 
            <p>However, not all such persons gain the wide renown of Gandhi, even 
              when they exhibit such consistency of spiritual intentions and actions. 
              Such a person was Abhay Charan De, who became better known as A. 
              C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, the spiritual founder of the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Though virtually all 
              of those who met Prabhupada attest to his spiritual fidelity and 
              integrity, few outside of ISKCON have claimed for him the title 
              of <i>mahatma</i> or the personal attribute of &quot;charisma&quot;. 
              In these brief reflections, I will suggest that Prabhupada was &quot;great-souled&quot; 
              and &quot;charismatic&quot;. I will then suggest that it was the 
              failure of his eleven early successors to understand fully the issues 
              surrounding fidelity of spirit and action that led many of them 
              astray. It seems to me that a brighter future for leaders in ISKCON 
              in America and elsewhere lies in an understanding of Prabhupäda's 
              personal spiritual legacy. 
            <p>Whether one is born in a humble home with few religious pretensions 
              or as the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, spiritual maturity is 
              a hard-won attainment. No person is born with the depth of spirituality 
              of a <i>mahätma.</i> Such clearly was the case with Abhay Charan 
              De. His early childhood hardly prefigured the powerful religious 
              person he was to become. His embrace of his family's Krishna faith 
              was tepid at best in his early years; indeed, he tells us that he 
              was very reluctant even to meet with Bhaktisiddhanta, his eventual 
              spiritual master. When Abhay began to express interest in his childhood 
              Krishna faith, his wife did not share his enthusiasm. The story 
              of his own growing faith and his wife's rejection of that faith 
              reminds us that developing religious teachers are not universally 
              attractive nor always materially successful. However, several influential 
              persons, from his childhood friend Naren Mullik to the members of 
              the League of Devotees in Jhansi, formed a cadre of supporters that 
              Abhay needed to develop his own deeper faith in Krishna. 
            <p>There is no doubt that the depth of Prabhupada's faith and spiritual 
              power was forged in the long hours of chanting, reflection, and 
              writing over eleven years of near-solitude in the temples and retreat 
              rooms of Vrindaban and New Delhi just prior to his coming to America. 
              But one cannot discount Prabhupada's own depiction of his spiritual 
              journey as one of gradual awakening and deepening certainty throughout 
              his whole life, including the period of his American and world ministry. 
              His <i> Back to Godhead</i> articles, written between 1944 and his 
              death in 1977 reveal the balance of spiritual practice and theological 
              conceptualisation that Prabhupada brought to his life's work. His 
              piety was grounded in both his intellect and his heart, and the 
              two were mutually sustaining. Therefore, Prabhupada's spiritual 
              journey included not only scriptural study and theological argumentation, 
              but also daily chanting and worship of Krishna; he thus engaged 
              his heart as fully as his head. I realise that this very way of 
              separating a faith of head and heart would be uncomfortable to Prabhupada, 
              but it is just such a split that I think led some of his appointed 
              successors down roads of self-deception and ruin - a theme to be 
              discussed later in this essay. 
            <p>While on his voyage to America on the Indian ship Jaladuta in the 
              Autumn of 1965, Prabhupada wrote a prayer that said, in part, &quot;Although 
              my Guru Maharaja [Bhaktisiddhanta] ordered me to accomplish this 
              mission, I am not worthy or fit to do it... Therefore, O Lord [Krishna], 
              now I am begging for Your mercy so that I may become worthy.&quot; 
              Even at the age of sixty-nine, Prabhupada felt a deep-seated need 
              for the guidance of Krishna to lead him in his daily work. This 
              is the perspective of a humble, faith-filled man. These are the 
              words of one who believed that the knowledge gained from the Krishna 
              scriptures, and his years of study and translation of them were 
              not sufficient without continual nourishment of his faith by the 
              practice of chanting and praising of Lord Krishna. It was this balance 
              of scriptural erudition and deep personal faith to which his early 
              followers were attracted - not to a flashy self-presentation or 
              spellbinding sermons. One of Prabhupada's first devotees said simply, 
              &quot;I didn't have any emotional experiences. Prabhupada was very 
              much an ordinary person until you developed a relationship [with 
              him].&quot; 
            <p>In my interviews with more than 130 devotees between 1980 and 1990, 
              devotee after devotee revealed that they were strongly attracted 
              to Prabhupada because of his scriptural erudition and sincere devotion 
              - that is, his piety. One early devotee said, &quot;He was chanting, 
              and just by the sound of his voice I could see that this person 
              loves God.&quot; Another devotee who was sceptical of flashy Indian 
              gurus said, &quot;When he walked in, I thought, 'He is different...' 
              He had that bearing, that gravity, that clear seriousness that you 
              associate with a military leader, a commander... The <i>kirtana</i> 
              began and Prabhupada became immediately ecstatic... [He] shattered 
              all my previous conceptions about a spiritual master.&quot; Even 
              academic scholars like Stillson Judah were &quot;struck by his humility&quot;. 
              As yet another devotee said, &quot;he never put on a show.&quot; 
              The composite picture one gets of Prabhupada is of a religious seeker 
              who never forgot his finitude before God, even when he achieved 
              a high level of spiritual development and served as the channel 
              for the devotee's love to God. Prabhupada was impressive to devotee 
              and outsider alike because of his personal piety. In this sense, 
              he was a <i>mahatma.</i> 
            <p>However, Prabhupada's spiritual authority was also rooted in traditional 
              Vaishnava theological claims about the guru as a direct channel 
              to Lord Krishna. The Gaudiya Vaishnava notion of disciplic succession, 
              or paramparä (literally &quot;uninterrupted series&quot;), says 
              that an initiating guru stands in an unbroken chain of disciples 
              from Chaitanya and other notable teachers back to Krishna himself. 
              The guru is understood to be an external representation of God, 
              and as such, receives devotion intended for Krishna and serves as 
              a conduit for that devotion. Prabhupada says this succinctly: &quot;A 
              disciple has to accept the spiritual master not only as spiritual 
              master, but also as the representative of the Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead and the Supersoul. In other words, the disciple should 
              accept the spiritual master as God because he is the external manifestation 
              of Krishna.&quot; Prabhupada spoke with just such traditional authority. 
              He instructed his disciples to surrender completely to the guru 
              in order to attain their fullest spiritual maturation. In making 
              such assertions, Prabhupada was conveying age-old teachings of the 
              medieval Vaishnava scripture that says, &quot;It is the duty of 
              every human being to surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. 
              Giving him everything - body, mind, and intelligence - one must 
              take a Vaishnava initiation from him.&quot; In this sense, Prabhupada 
              had &quot;traditional charisma&quot; in Max Weber's terms. 
            <p>When I was asked to offer this brief reflection on Prabhupada, 
              I was reminded of images of a special, holy man who, by his erudition 
              and personal piety as well as by his traditional role, touched the 
              lives of thousands of devotees in India, America and around the 
              world. I was also struck by the realisation that for all of his 
              extraordinary attributes, Prabhupada could not pass on his own personal 
              faith to his appointed successors even as he did pass on the mantle 
              of leadership (that is, traditional roles) for ISKCON. As I reminisced 
              about my interactions with Krishna gurus and devotees, which began 
              in 1974 and intensified through the 1980s, I was struck by this 
              realisation that the traditional roles and scriptural erudition 
              could be transmitted by teaching, but that the personal piety and 
              deep faith that attracted devotees to Prabhupada could not. 
            <p>As I reviewed my interviews with devotees from the years just following 
              the death of Prabhupada, I came to realise that many devotees, and 
              certainly all of the newly appointed initiating gurus, spoke with 
              a confidence and enthusiasm about their maturing Krishna faith that 
              was almost always grounded in scriptural authority (that is, in 
              reciting a Krishna text), or in Prabhupada's interpretations of 
              those texts. It is true that some of the new gurus were noted for 
              their ecstatic chanting or personal piety, but their claim to authority 
              was grounded primarily in scriptural passages like those cited above. 
              Most &quot;new gurus&quot; exhibited a confidence, even a cockiness, 
              that if the scriptures said a guru was &quot;as good as God&quot;, 
              then it was so - forgetting that such claims must be grounded in 
              the kind of personal humility that Prabhupada exhibited. In the 
              early and mid-1980s, I talked with some new gurus who were exceptionally 
              bright and erudite in scriptural argumentation but who had stopped 
              doing <i>sankirtan</i> themselves even as they taught the importance 
              of such &quot;preaching&quot; to new devotees. I met other new gurus 
              who were talented organisational managers but who had stopped chanting 
              their morning rounds of <i>japa,</i> and ultimately fell from their 
              lofty positions because of immoral behaviour. I met only a few new 
              gurus who were impressive because of their humbleness and piety, 
              and they have continued to provide leadership for ISKCON - even 
              in the dark days of the early and mid-1980s. 
            <p> What is the legacy that Prabhupada has left for ISKCON? It is 
              the legacy of traditional authority (<i>parampara</i>), scriptural 
              erudition and personal piety as necessary corollaries to a healthy 
              and vibrant Krishna faith. Even as the reformers in ISKCON attempted 
              in the mid-1980s to reduce ISKCON'S reliance on relatively few gurus 
              (by appointing many new ones) and to separate some managerial and 
              organisational functions from the spiritual role of the guru, Prabhupada's 
              legacy of personal piety and moral purity seldom was offered as 
              the key to a new guru's success. Prabhupada's legacy is a faith 
              marked by a blend of head and heart - both focused upon God's divine 
              mercy and compassion-that separates the true spiritual master from 
              the impostor. 
            <p>Too many of the early gurus relied upon their traditional scriptural 
              authority alone or upon artificial affectations of spirituality 
              to maintain their positions - until they &quot;fell&quot;. Those 
              who have engaged in arduous spiritual practise balanced with disciplined 
              scriptural study over the past thirty years have acquired the status 
              and piety of the <i>acharya</i> that the scriptures describe. 
            <p>Nori Muster, in her forthcoming book <i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i>, 
              offers a perspective on the gap between religious proclamations 
              and practise in ISKCON during her years in the movement throughout 
              the 1980s that I encourage all of those in leadership positions 
              in ISKCON today to take seriously. Though Muster's book may emphasise 
              primarily the negative attitudes and events associated with ISKCON 
              in America, it also reveals her longing for models of piety and 
              integrity that gurus and ISKCON leaders purportedly represent. Her 
              story reveals the deleterious effects of shallow religiosity, unethical 
              conduct and self-deceptive proclamations by some of ISKCON'S gurus 
              and leaders on the average devotee who simply looks to see how wide 
              the gap is between what a person asserts about his or her authority 
              as a spiritual leader and what he or she actually does. For Prabhupada 
              that gap was quite narrow. That is his legacy, from which contemporary 
              gurus can learn much. 
            <p>The good news is that there are many signs in America, Europe and 
              elsewhere in the world that gurus and other leaders in ISKCON recognise 
              that they must live and act in ways that are more consistent with 
              their teachings. Conferences held in Europe during the past half 
              dozen years reveal a more contrite and apologetic tone in public 
              self-presentations by devotees. However, Prabhupada's legacy is 
              richer still in the lesson it would teach to contemporary devotees: 
              that the quality of one's spiritual practice and growth must undergird 
              one's theological and scriptural erudition and public and private 
              actions. His lesson is for the developing spiritual seeker-not for 
              one seeking a religious role in ISKCON as an institution. 
            <p>In the final analysis, Prabhupada's life suggests that only the 
              guru who truly is linked to Krishna by his or her own private and 
              public devotion can serve as a conduit for disciples who rely upon 
              the Vaishnava's disciplic succession. Over the years, many Krishna 
              devotees have quoted to me numerous scriptural passages that confirm 
              this view of their disciplic authority - but seldom have they cited 
              the faith-development of Prabhupäda as a model for their own development. 
              With Prabhupada, the recitation of scriptural authorities was not 
              necessary to confirm his role as acarya. Images of the love-filled 
              and ecstatic Prabhupada softly singing praises to Krishna is his 
              legacy of God-centered love-images which can serve ISKCON and its 
              leaders well in his absence. It is this legacy of a guru's devotion 
              and humility before God - his piety - that Prabhupada asks his successors 
              to emulate. What better legacy could a spiritual teacher leave to 
              those who would follow him?<a href="#1">1</a> 
            <p><b>Footnote</b> 
            <p><a name="1"></a>For an early thought-piece on the guru-disciple 
              relationship, see my essay &quot;Conflicting Network: Guru and Friend 
              in ISKCON&quot;, in <i>Religious Movements, Genesis, Exodus, and 
              Numbers</i>, edited by Rodney Start (New York: Paragon House, 1985). 
              For a fuller description of my understanding of the role and place 
              of Prabhupada as guru and the difficulties of transmitting prophetic 
              charisma to one's successors, see &quot;Chapter 2 Godmen and Gurus&quot; 
              and &quot;Chapter 3 The Transmission of Charisma&quot; in <i>The 
              Dark Lord: Cult Images and the Hare Krishnas in America</i> (Philadelphia: 
              Westminister, 1987). The reader will see how my reflections have 
              moved from an earlier formal and scholarly analysis of religious 
              and institutional roles and categories, to one currently more reliant 
              on the intangible synthesis of thought and religious practise in 
              what I can only imprecisely call &quot;piety&quot; or &quot;spiritual 
              integrity&quot;.
