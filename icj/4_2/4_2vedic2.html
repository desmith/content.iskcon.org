            <p align=left><b>Part Two<br>
              </b>NB. The footnotes for this article are linked to a separate 
              <a href="4_2vedicfoot.html"> footnote</a> page. 
            <p align=LEFT>I have already mentioned that the wide application of 
              the&nbsp; term &quot;Veda&quot; and the corresponding adjective 
              &quot;Vedic&quot;&nbsp; has not gone unchallenged in South Asia; 
              indeed, it remains a bone of contention&nbsp; to this very day. 
              Yet even many challenging this usage of the word seem&nbsp; not 
              to be able to escape the influence of this very usage, as an extract&nbsp; 
              from a small booklet setting forth tenets of the Arya Samaj shows: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>The Vedas are four in number, The Rg. Veda [sic], 
                The Yajur&nbsp; Veda, The Sama Veda, The Atherva [sic] Veda. Vedic 
                literature consists&nbsp; of other treatises also, some commentaries, 
                others [sic] notes, legends&nbsp; and stories of different values, 
                written in different times and under&nbsp; different circumstances. 
                As far as the Arya Samaj in [sic] concerned,&nbsp; the Vedas are 
                the final authority. All other treatises, old or new, small&nbsp; 
                or big, are only of secondary importance.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#44"><sup>44</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>This confusion has had the not surprising effect of 
              necessitating&nbsp; a clarification of some sort. Often it is explained 
              that those texts which&nbsp; qualify as &quot;Vedic&quot; according 
              to the definition also followed by&nbsp; Western classical indologists 
              are the original Vedas. Prabhupada also follows&nbsp; this terminology 
              at times,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#45"><sup>45</sup></a> even differentiating 
              between the original Vedas&nbsp; and the &quot;supplementary Vedic 
              literatures&quot; (namely the Puranas).<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#46"><sup>46</sup></a> 
              But&nbsp; he notes with disapproval the Arya Samaj's acceptance 
              of only these original&nbsp; Vedas as authoritative.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#47"> 
              <sup>47</sup></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada also draws attention to statements in Madhva's&nbsp; 
              commentary on the <i>Brahmasutra</i> which bolster his usage of 
              &quot;Veda&quot;&nbsp; to correspond to &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot;. 
              He refers to the commentary&nbsp; on <i>Brahmasutra</i> 1,1,3 as 
              proof that according to Madhva the four Vedic&nbsp; Samhitas, the 
              <i>Mahabharata,</i> the <i>Pancaratra</i> and the &quot;original 
              <i>Ramayana</i>&quot; (as he translates Madhva's <i>mularamayana-</i>) 
              are&nbsp; &quot;Vedic literatures&quot;. Prabhupada holds that according 
              to Madhva&nbsp; &quot;any literature following the conclusive statements 
              of this Vedic literature&nbsp; is also to be considered Vedic literature.&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#48"><sup>48</sup></a> 
              Actually,&nbsp; in the passage referred to, Madhva designates these 
              texts only as <i>shastra-</i>,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#49"><sup>49</sup></a> 
              but Prabhupada also quotes another verse from&nbsp; Madhva's commentary 
              on 2,1,5 (Prabhupada refers to it as 2,1,6)<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#50"> 
              <sup>50</sup></a> which clearly designates these same texts, as&nbsp; 
              well as the puranas accepted as authoritative by Vaishnavas, as 
              &quot;Veda&quot;.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#51"><sup>51</sup></a> 
              Though Madhva only quotes this verse from a&nbsp; Purana, the fact 
              that he does obviously accept it as authoritative shows&nbsp; that 
              he subscribes to its views.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#52"><sup>52</sup></a> 
              It&nbsp; should be noted, however, that (at least as far as I can 
              ascertain) Prabhupada&nbsp; does not seem to follow Madhva to the 
              extent of calling texts other than&nbsp; those already referred 
              to above &quot;Vedic&quot;, i.e. in extending the&nbsp; scope of 
              what I have designated as &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot; even more. 
            <p align=LEFT>In this context I may be permitted to draw attention 
              to the&nbsp; fact that the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> is also traditionally 
              known as an Upanishad.&nbsp; Prabhupada too does not fail to draw 
              attention to this.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#53"><sup>53</sup></a> 
              May not such traditional terminology have facilitated&nbsp; the 
              development of the semantic field of what I have labelled &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot;? 
            <p align=LEFT>This brings us to another problem regarding Prabhupada's 
              terminology.&nbsp; A few times he refers to the Vedas <i>and</i> 
              the Upanishads,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#54"><sup>54</sup></a>&nbsp; 
              even though the former mostly subsumes the latter. Such a differentiation&nbsp; 
              is clearly problematic, unless it refers not to the differentiation 
              between&nbsp; Vedic and non-Vedic texts, but to texts more concerned 
              with sacrifice and&nbsp; those not concerned with the topic, viz., 
              to non-Upanishadic Vedic texts&nbsp; and the Upanishads. Or else 
              &quot;Veda&quot; here is used in the same archaic&nbsp; sense which 
              Bronkhorst<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#55"><sup>55</sup></a> has drawn 
              attention to, namely to denote the&nbsp; mantras, here in their 
              collected form (as the Samhitas), thus differentiating&nbsp; them 
              from other Vedic texts. 
            <p align=LEFT>This explanation seems indeed to be the correct one, 
              for Prabhupada&nbsp; also explicitly speaks of four Vedas and the 
              Upanishads,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#56"><sup>56</sup></a> &nbsp; 
              and differentiates between &quot;<i>Upanishads</i> and Vedic <i>mantras</i>&quot;<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#57"><sup>57</sup></a>&nbsp; 
              (even though <i>mantra- </i>is elsewhere used to refer to quotations 
              from&nbsp; the Upanishads too).<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#58"><sup>58 
              </sup></a> Thus, it does seem that what is meant here is&nbsp; a 
              differentiation primarily between the Samhitas and the Upanishads, 
              the&nbsp; place of Brahmanas and Aranyakas remaining unclear. And 
              it is the Samhitas,&nbsp; in contradistinction to the Upanishads, 
              which are in the context of this&nbsp; differentiation referred 
              to as &quot;Vedas.&quot; 
            <p align=LEFT>We thus have another use of &quot;Vedic&quot; here, 
              which&nbsp; I propose to label &quot;Vedic3.&quot; The differentiation 
              between Vedas&nbsp; and Upanishads is incidentally also referred 
              to by another branch of the <i>parampara</i>- associated with Bhaktibinod 
              Thakur.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#59"><sup>59</sup></a> 
            <p align=LEFT>Finally, we find a usage of the word &quot;Veda&quot; 
              (without,&nbsp; so it seems, any corresponding adjective &quot;Vedic&quot;) 
              which seems&nbsp; confined to Prabhupada's oral discourses and does 
              not-at least as far as&nbsp; I could ascertain-appear in his writings.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#60"><sup>60</sup></a> 
              In&nbsp; this case Prabhupada recurs to the primary meaning of <i>veda-,</i> 
              namely,&nbsp; &quot;(sacred) knowledge&quot;, and applies this to 
              the sacred scriptures&nbsp; of any religion, as examples naming 
              the Bible and the Koran.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#61"><sup>61</sup></a> 
              &nbsp; But it seems that this use of the word &quot;Veda&quot; to 
              refer to scripture&nbsp; associated with other religious traditions 
              is hardly known, probably because&nbsp; it is - seemingly - not 
              found in Prabhupada's writings, but only in the&nbsp; transcripts 
              of his conversations, which were until recently not easy to&nbsp; 
              come by. 
            <p align=LEFT>Thus we see that Prabhupada uses the same word &quot;Vedic&quot;&nbsp; 
              in three different meanings: &quot;Vedic<sub>1</sub>&quot; approximates&nbsp; 
              most closely to what the Western classical indologist would understand 
              by&nbsp; this term; &quot;Vedic<sub>2</sub>&quot; refers to texts 
              containing what&nbsp; is to Prabhupada Vedic thought and which are 
              hallowed inasmuch as they are&nbsp; derived from Vyasa; and &quot;Vedic<sub>3</sub>&quot; 
              is a narrower application&nbsp; of &quot;Vedic1&quot;, referring 
              only to the Samhitas (as contrasted to&nbsp; the Upanishads) and 
              thus continuing an ancient usage of the term. Prabhupada&nbsp; also 
              is on record as using &quot;Veda&quot; to refer to other scriptural&nbsp; 
              traditions. Obviously, this usage of the same term in different 
              meanings&nbsp; is liable to lead to misunderstandings, unless one 
              is able to carefully&nbsp; differentiate these different meanings 
              in each individual case in which&nbsp; the term is used. 
            <p align=LEFT>Have those following in Prabhupada's footsteps always 
              been&nbsp; aware of these differentiations? I have already briefly 
              remarked on this&nbsp; problem of the usage of &quot;Vedic&quot; 
              and &quot;Veda&quot; elsewhere,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#62"><sup>62</sup></a> 
              as&nbsp; well as the fact that some scholars, particularly from 
              North America (and&nbsp; not affiliated with ISKCON), also often 
              do not explicate what they mean&nbsp; by &quot;Vedic&quot; in certain 
              problematic contexts.<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#63"><sup>63</sup></a> 
              This latter is in no small part due to the fact&nbsp; that a similar 
              variety of meanings also seems to obtain in other modern&nbsp; writings 
              on South Asian religions, especially writings from groups professing&nbsp; 
              these religions. 
            <p align=LEFT>Although it would be highly interesting to examine this 
              problem&nbsp; and how such terminological issues may have influenced 
              Prabhupada, our concern&nbsp; here is only with finding out what 
              Prabhupada means in his writings, and&nbsp; how what he means has 
              influenced others. To obtain an answer to this question,&nbsp; I 
              have examined a sampling of writing by scholars affiliated with 
              ISKCON&nbsp; or influenced by Prabhupada, and have analysed their 
              use of the terms &quot;Veda&quot;&nbsp; and/or &quot;Vedic&quot;. 
              Unfortunately, I could obtain only a handful of&nbsp; works,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#64"><sup>64</sup></a> 
              and&nbsp; of these only a few contained relevant information. But 
              I think that these&nbsp; few will nevertheless serve to give some 
              idea of the usage prevailing, even&nbsp; if they may not be truly 
              representative. 
            <p align=LEFT>A work by Nanda-nandana<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#65"><sup>65</sup></a> 
              is&nbsp; particularly interesting in this regard. He first refers 
              to the Vedic literatures&nbsp; (mark the plural!) as being composed, 
              in their oldest part, of the <i>Rigveda,&nbsp; Yajurveda, Samaveda 
              </i>and<i> Atharvaveda</i>, followed by the Brahmanas,&nbsp; the 
              Aranyakas and the Upanishads. But he then goes on to add the Vedantasutra,&nbsp; 
              the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> the <i>Mahabharata,</i> the Puranas and 
              the <i>Ramayana</i> (p.23). Yet he seems aware of the problems connected 
              with this terminology,&nbsp; as he refers to the Puranas and the 
              <i>Mahabharata</i> as &quot;Vedic supplementary&nbsp; literatures&quot; 
              (pp.37f.) and differentiates between <i>sruti-</i> and <i>smriti-,</i> 
              to which latter he reckons the Puranas, <i>Bhagavadgita</i> and 
              <i>Mahabharata</i> (p.38). Interestingly, his definition of <i>sruti-</i> 
              is &quot;the four Vedas and the Upanisads&quot;. This clearly characterises&nbsp; 
              the Samhitas alone as being &quot;Veda&quot; in a narrow sense. 
              He further&nbsp; quotes Shankara, of whom Prabhupada's opinion is 
              ambivalent, to show that&nbsp; the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> is &quot;the 
              epitome of the essentials of the whole&nbsp; Vedic teaching&quot; 
              (p.38), and also cites passages from the Puranas, claiming&nbsp; 
              that these are Vedic as well. He draws attention to a passage from 
              the <i> Chandogyopanishad</i> that regards the Itihasas and Puranas 
              as the fifth Veda. From all of this&nbsp; he deduces that all the 
              texts he has mentioned are &quot;authentic Vedic&nbsp; literatures&quot; 
              (p.38). Once the bona fides of these works as Vedic have&nbsp; been 
              established, the author basically uses only the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> 
              and the <i>Bhagavatapurana</i> to explain &quot;secret teachings 
              of the&nbsp; Vedas.&quot; 
            <p align=LEFT>The similarities of Nanda-nandana's many-faceted usage 
              of&nbsp; &quot;Veda&quot; and &quot;Vedic&quot; with that of Prabhupada 
              are too obvious&nbsp; to receive comment. It seems, though, that 
              Nanda-nandana is quite aware&nbsp; of the potential for confusion 
              contained in such usage, and thus systematically&nbsp; explains 
              his terminology before starting on his actual subject matter. In&nbsp; 
              this he differs from Prabhupada, whose remarks are, as we have seen, 
              scattered&nbsp; throughout his work, and not explicated systematically. 
            <p align=LEFT> Satsvarupa dasa too, in his work on Vedic literature,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#66"><sup>66</sup></a> 
              &nbsp; basically has the same arguments found in the work of Nanda-nandana 
              (pp.1f.),&nbsp; even differentiating between &quot;The Four Vedas&quot; 
              and &quot;The Upanishads&quot;&nbsp; (pp.40ff.). His gleanings from 
              &quot;Vedic&quot; literature also are, not&nbsp; surprisingly, as 
              a rule from the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> and the <i>Bhagavatapurana.</i> 
              Thus he too seems to give us a more or less faithful representation 
              of the&nbsp; ideas of Prabhupada. But he further adds a statement 
              which introduces a&nbsp; subtle twist, and the matter seems to me 
              so interesting that I shall quote&nbsp; the relevant passage (pp.1f.) 
              in full: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>In any case, to be accepted as Vedic, a literature 
                must&nbsp; maintain the same purpose as the original Vedic texts. 
                The Vedic scriptures&nbsp; (<i>shastras</i>) comprise a harmonious 
                whole with a harmonious conclusion&nbsp; (<i>siddhanta</i>). Consequently, 
                we may accept as a bona fide Vedic writing&nbsp; any work that 
                expands on the Vedic <i>siddhanta</i> without changing its&nbsp; 
                meaning, even if the work is not one of the original scriptures. 
                In fact,&nbsp; the Vedic tradition necessitates further authoritative 
                works that convey&nbsp; the Vedic message according to time and 
                place. However, to be genuine,&nbsp; these extensions of Vedic 
                literature must strictly conform to the doctrines&nbsp; of the 
                Vedas, the Puranas, and the <i>Vedanta-Sutra.<br>
                <br>
                </i>Vedic literature is neither dead nor archaic. Nevertheless, 
                any literature&nbsp; - be it ancient or modern - must be considered 
                non-Vedic if it deviates&nbsp; from the Vedic <i>siddhanta.</i> 
                Thus Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, though&nbsp; definitely outgrowths 
                of Vedic literature, are not considered Vedic. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>This, as is obvious, could allow one to bestow the epithet&nbsp; 
              &quot;Vedic&quot; on many more texts than those mentioned by Prabhupada,&nbsp; 
              while at the same time rejecting certain texts Prabhupada considers 
              to be&nbsp; Vedic. In both cases the main criterion is the contents 
              of the individual&nbsp; work, and clearly this facilitates manipulation. 
              As it is, although I have&nbsp; found no evidence at all for individual 
              works, or their parts, regarded&nbsp; as &quot;Vedic&quot; by Prabhupada 
              being rejected as non-Vedic, there are&nbsp; examples in the writings 
              of Satsvarupa dasa for an extension of the scope&nbsp; of the epithet 
              &quot;Vedic&quot;. Thus, in a &quot;book of essays on selected&nbsp; 
              verses of Vedic literatures&quot;<a
 href="4_2vedicfoot.html#67"><sup>67</sup></a> we find quoted, obviously as examples 
              of Vedic&nbsp; literature, alongside the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> the 
              <i>Bhagavatapurana,</i> the <i>Brahmasamhita</i> and the Upanishads, 
              also Chaitanya's <i>Shikshastaka</i> and Sanatana Goswamin's <i>Haribhaktivilasa.</i> 
            <p align=LEFT>One may argue that these are extremely important works 
              for&nbsp; Gaudiya Vaishnavism; but what about the case of the <i>Prabhupadapranamamantra</i> 
              (p.125)? Satsvarupa dasa too is clearly aware that this is not actually&nbsp; 
              &quot;Vedic&quot;, but justifies its inclusion on the grounds that 
              it &quot;will&nbsp; continue to be recited just like classical Vedic 
              <i>slokas</i>&quot; (p.134).<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#68"><sup>68</sup></a>&nbsp; 
              This is a most interesting development, and it clearly accords with 
              what&nbsp; Madhva says in his commentary on the <i>Brahmasutra</i><a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#69"><sup>69</sup></a>.&nbsp; 
              However, as I have already pointed out, I have not found evidence 
              that Prabhupada&nbsp; followed Madhva in this. Even though Prabhupada 
              does say that &quot;any&nbsp; books deriving knowledge from these 
              Vedas are considered Vedic literatures&quot;,<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#70"><sup>70</sup></a> 
              I&nbsp; have found no evidence that he has actually interpreted 
              this definition&nbsp; so widely. But such an interpretation is possible 
              if one takes such statements&nbsp; literally, and this seems to 
              have been the case with Satsvarupa dasa. 
            <p align=LEFT>Ravindra Svarupa dasa, however, takes a different approach&nbsp; 
              in his collection of essays<a href="4_2vedicfoot.html#71"><sup>71</sup></a>.&nbsp; 
              He mentions Vedic knowledge often, and the <i>Bhagavadgita</i> is 
              referred&nbsp; to as being the essence of this (p.51), but, as far 
              as I could ascertain,&nbsp; it is nowhere called Vedic literature. 
              In fact, the only time he defines&nbsp; the term &quot;Veda&quot; 
              is when he says: &quot;Vyasa divided the Veda&nbsp; into four and 
              wrote it down. Yet he knew that we would still be unable to&nbsp; 
              understand the Vedas, and so he composed a number of supplementary 
              works&nbsp; in which he spelled out the intentions of Vedic thought 
              explicitly&quot;&nbsp; (p.51). It is obvious that the &quot;supplementary 
              works&quot; are the very&nbsp; ones which I have called &quot;Vedic2&quot;. 
              In this way Ravindra Svarupa&nbsp; avoids the ambiguity of Prabhupada's 
              terminology. He could even have pointed&nbsp; to a similar usage 
              by Prabhupada himself <a href="http://www.icj.iskcon.net/4_2vedic2foot.htm"><sup>72</sup></a>. 
            <p align=LEFT>The last significant author I would like to mention 
              is Steven&nbsp; Rosen. He follows Prabhupada's terminology in that 
              several times he calls&nbsp; &quot;Vedic&quot; all the texts for 
              which I have chosen the labels &quot;Vedic1&quot;&nbsp; and &quot;Vedic2&quot;. 
              <a href="http://www.icj.iskcon.net/4_2vedic2foot.htm"><sup>73</sup></a>&nbsp; 
              According to him, the &quot;many sections of the Vedic texts&quot; 
              include&nbsp; the <i>smriti-</i><a href="http://www.icj.iskcon.net/4_2vedic2foot.htm"><sup>74</sup></a>. 
              He explicitly calls the Puranas &quot;later&nbsp; 'Vedic' texts.&quot;<a href="http://www.icj.iskcon.net/4_2vedic2foot.htm"><sup>75</sup></a> 
              &nbsp; But the word &quot;Vedic&quot; in the last citation is put 
              within quotation&nbsp; marks, which could be Rosen's way of differentiating 
              it from what I have&nbsp; called Prabhupada's &quot;Vedic1&quot;. 
            <p align=LEFT>Thus, even this very small sampling of writings shows 
              a diverse&nbsp; usage of the term &quot;Vedic&quot;, a usage which 
              may at times be considered&nbsp; not a faithful reproduction of 
              Prabhupada's own usage. The possible implications,&nbsp; if any, 
              of such discrepancies are not a part of this study. Neither have&nbsp; 
              I been concerned here with the problem thrown up if Prabhupada's 
              spiritual&nbsp; lineage should, as Elkman (op.cit. in note 4) holds, 
              ultimately extend back&nbsp; to Baladeva (p.186) - the same Baladeva 
              who, again according to Elkman (p.41),&nbsp; does not believe in 
              the authoritative nature of the Puranas, including the <i>Bhagavatapurana.</i>
