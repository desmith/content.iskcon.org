            <p><i>Continuing our theme of articles about Srila Prabhupada in his 
              centenary year Charles Selengut offers us this study of Prabhupada 
              as the founder and charismatic leader of Vaishnavism's first international 
              society. He gives us a comprehensive overview of Prabhupada's struggle 
              to establish ISKCON and the qualities that marked him as uniquely 
              suited for the task. He shows us Prabhupada's attitude to Western 
              values and his faithful regard for Vaishnava principles. Finally 
              Selengut questions if it is possible for scholars to acknowledge 
              the experience of charisma or "the Holy" without reducing it to 
              psychological states or sociological categories.</i> 
            <ul>
              <p>It's an astonishing story. If someone told you a story like this, 
                you would not believe it. Here is this person, he's seventy years 
                old, he's going to a country where he has no money, he has no 
                contacts. He has none of the things you would say that make for 
                success. He's going to recruit people not on any systematic basis, 
                but just picking up whomever he comes across and he's going to 
                give them responsibility for organising a world-wide movement. 
                You'd say "what kind of program is that?" (Hopkins, 1983:127) 
            </ul>
            <p>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was this person. Born 
              Abhay Caran De on September 1, 1896 in Calcutta, India, to a traditionally 
              religious Hindu family, he received a comprehensive religious and 
              secular education, studying Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy with private 
              tutors, and later attending the prestigious Scottish Churches' College 
              in Calcutta. Upon reaching adulthood, his father, Gour Mohan, a 
              pious follower of the Vaishnava tradition, arranged a marriage for 
              Abhay Caran De to Radharani Datta, the daughter of a prominent Vaishnava 
              family, who was to be the mother of De's five children. After completing 
              his studies, De entered upon a career as a manager for a large Indian 
              pharmaceutical company. He remained in the pharmaceutical business 
              for some thirty years, working both as a manager for large firms 
              and as a small entrepreneur. De was moderately successful in his 
              various ventures, but several of the companies he established in 
              large Indian cities ended in bankruptcy. 
            <p>Although his early childhood piety had waned somewhat during his 
              college years, as an adult he visited temples regularly and maintained 
              contact with the Vaishnava community. A turning point in his life 
              came when, in 1932, he received initiation from Bhaktisiddhanta 
              Sarasvati, the spiritual leader of a religious institution known 
              as the Gaudiya Math, that traced its roots to the revitalisation 
              movement founded by Sri Chaitanya in sixteenth century India. From 
              1932 to 1954, De continued his pharmaceutical work, but spent increasing 
              time and money on his religious activities. During this period he 
              greatly increased his writing and preaching activities, and began 
              publishing <i>Back to Godhead</i> magazine. In 1954, following conflict 
              with his wife over his increasing religious commitments, Abhay-now 
              called Bhaktivedanta, a title awarded him in 1939 for his scholarly 
              and devotional activities-left his family, committing himself fully 
              to religious life. 
            <p>From 1954 until 1965 Bhaktivedanta lived in various Indian cities, 
              writing, preaching and publishing books, pamphlets, and lectures 
              in his effort to spread the Krishna religion. In 1959 he was initiated 
              as a <i>sannyasi</i> (monk) by Keshava Maharaja, one of his "Godbrothers" 
              in the Gaudiya Math. During this period he made some important contacts 
              with Indian leaders. Through his writing and preaching he began 
              to attract a few disciples. But it was to America, the largest English-speaking 
              country in the world, where he felt himself drawn and where he believed 
              his religious mission to be. 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta's own "Godbrothers" and sympathetic acquaintances 
              tried to discourage him from leaving India, arguing that since he 
              was making an impact in India he should not undertake such a long 
              journey at such an advanced age (he was nearly seventy). Bhaktivedanta, 
              however, persisted, explaining that his spiritual master had asked 
              him to preach the Krishna tradition in America.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#1">1</a> 
              So, in accordance with Bhaktisiddhanta's instructions, Bhaktivedanta 
              left his native India in 1965 for the United States. 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta's trip to the United States was not sponsored by 
              any religious organisation, nor was he met upon arrival by a group 
              of loyal followers. Rather, he travelled for more than a month on 
              the Indian freighter "Jaladuta" as it made its way from India-first 
              to Boston and then to New York City. He arrived in New York on September 
              19, 1965 with a few belongings-but with a firm determination to 
              spread the Krishna philosophy in America. From New York he took 
              a bus to Butler, a small town in western Pennsylvania, where he 
              stayed with the Agarwal family, who, though strangers to him, had 
              agreed to sponsor him. 
            <p>The first few weeks of Swami Bhaktivedanta's stay in America were 
              relatively uneventful and unnoticed. He lectured at some local colleges 
              and community gatherings-there were even a few notices about his 
              arrival in the local newspapers-but he does not appear to have made 
              any lasting contacts. One month after his arrival he returned to 
              New York City where he hoped to establish himself as a teacher and 
              preacher. In New York, Bhaktivedanta contacted Dr. Ramamurti Mishra, 
              a teacher of Indian philosophy on New York's West Side. Dr. Mishra 
              helped Bhaktivedanta get settled in New York, providing him with 
              temporary living quarters. 
            <p>Within five years of these modest beginnings, A. C. Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Prabhupada was the acknowledged spiritual leader and guru 
              of hundreds of devotee followers who were organised into a religious 
              movement with branches on several continents. By 1970 the new movement, 
              incorporated as "The International Society for Krishna Consciousness 
              (ISKCON)", had been given wide publicity by the media and popularised 
              for the sixties counterculture through such celebrities as Allen 
              Ginsberg and the Beatles. This new movement from the East was avowedly 
              evangelistic and situated in the mainstream of the sixties youth 
              and countercultural movements, performing their religious dances 
              in public parks, participating in anti-Vietnam War rallies, and 
              even, on occasions, appearing at rock concerts and music festivals. 
            <p>In spite of Bhaktivedanta Swami's close connection with the places 
              and personalities of the counterculture, he remained firmly committed 
              to the cultural and religious traditions of his native Indian Vaishnava 
              community, particularly in his emphasis on devotion to the Indian 
              Deity, Krishna. Bhaktivedanta Swami insisted on the most exact performance 
              of Vaishnava rituals, and on the observance of various religious 
              duties and prohibitions, the bulk of which were probably unknown 
              to his followers until they made his acquaintance. 
            <p>These events leave us with some intriguing questions. How, for 
              example, was it possible for this elderly Indian holy man to transplant 
              an indigenous Indian devotional tradition to the entirely different 
              social and cultural terrain of America? Why did some of the young 
              Americans who visited him come to accept his authority? Moreover, 
              why is it that some of those attracted to him and his preaching 
              took up the lifestyle he advocated-a life characterised by austerity 
              and self-denial, so unlike their previous mode of life? 
            <p>There are, of course, many different answers. The faithful see 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami's success as the work of God, of divine grace. 
              Others, antagonistic to unconventional religions, view the development 
              of ISKCON as the result of "coercive socialisation", of deception, 
              and even of "brainwashing". Still others would not want to focus 
              on the person of Bhaktivedanta Swami, but rather upon the "functions"-such 
              as relief from anxiety and tension-his movement performed for the 
              distressed and confused.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#2">2</a> 
            <p>The focus in this paper, however, is upon A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami 
              Prabhupada-his person and his style of leadership. The position 
              taken here is that psychological or cultural needs alone do not 
              create charismatic leaders. The rise of a religious movement is 
              not simply a matter of historical or cultural propitiousness, but 
              the result of a unique convergence of personality, social setting 
              and cultural needs. This is not to deny that charismatic religious 
              movements are likely to emerge, as Robert Tucker (1970:81) tells 
              us, when prevailing widespread dissatisfactions deepen and evolve 
              into distress or suffering. But to acknowledge situational factors 
              in the emergence of charisma does not explain why and how a particular 
              religious leader comes to be accepted and followed as the path to 
              salvation. My contention here is that the unique personal authority 
              of the charismatic leader grows out of the followers' conviction 
              that the leader, by virtue of special powers, qualities and wisdom, 
              can provide relief from their distress, suffering and confusion. 
              Both the leader and the message make the charismatic effervescence 
              possible. Theories which emphasise one factor to the exclusion of 
              the other do an injustice to the confluence of forces necessary 
              for the rise of charismatic movements. The successful development 
              of ISKCON in American must be seen, then, as largely a result of 
              Prabhupada's leadership. 
            <p><b>Prophetic Charisma: The Source of Prabhupada's Authority<br>
              </b>Prabhupada's religious authority and innovative leadership are 
              explainable in terms of his being a charismatic prophet. As Weber 
              explained (1947:358-59), charisma is a descriptive and non-evaluative 
              category-applicable to conventionally "good" as well as "evil" leaders-and 
              describes "a certain quality of individual personality by virtue 
              of which one is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed 
              with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional 
              power or qualities". These special qualities are regarded by followers 
              as of "divine origin", and on that basis the charismatic individual 
              is treated as a leader worthy of loyalty. To his followers, Prabhupada 
              was such a person, the bearer of an ultimate and salvationist truth 
              available to them if they were loyal and obedient to his directives. 
              The uniqueness of the charismatic prophet is his ability to provide, 
              as Weber puts it, "a consciously integrated and meaningful attitude 
              to life". Prophets, therefore, tend to come forward at times of 
              social and cultural crisis; they preach that personal and societal 
              life can be made meaningful and satisfying once again if lived in 
              accordance with their proclamations. As Weber (1963:59) explains: 
            <ul>
              <p>To the prophet, both the life of man and the world, both social 
                and cosmic events, have a certain systematic and coherent meaning. 
                To this meaning the conduct of mankind must be oriented if it 
                is to bring salvation, for only in relation to this meaning does 
                life obtain a unified and significant pattern. 
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike the warrior or priest-other possible types of charismatic 
              leaders-the prophet's authority does not derive from the performance 
              of religious ritual, heroic deeds or heredity, but from his conviction 
              of "being the organ, instrument, or mouthpiece of the divine will" 
              (Wach, 1944:347). Again, in contrast to charismatic political leaders, 
              the prophet's claim to authority is not based upon his personal 
              will, or even deep insight, but upon the word of God revealed to 
              the prophet directly or through a sacred tradition. 
            <p align=LEFT>The prophet is also a radical critic of society. As 
              a consequence of his intense relationship with the divine-with what 
              he takes to be the deepest sources of truth and reality-the prophet 
              demands that the social order conform to the moral order as known 
              to him through his experience and knowledge of God's will. The prophet, 
              possibly as a consequence of his personal experience of the divine 
              will, appears throughout religious history as a confident and courageous 
              critic of the <i>status quo</i>. 
            <p align=LEFT>Srila Prabhupada's ability to create ISKCON needs to 
              be seen in light of his own self-consciousness as an authorised 
              prophet, and of the acceptance and recognition of his prophetic 
              powers by his early followers. Evidence abounds of his conviction 
              that he was a messenger through which Krishna consciousness would 
              be brought to the Western world. From the time Prabhupada left his 
              family and business associations and took up full-time religious 
              life, he saw himself as the person who would awaken the entire world-particularly 
              the educated elements in India and America-to the faith system and 
              redemptive powers of Krishna consciousness. 
            <p align=LEFT>This powerful self-consciousness, the overwhelming sense 
              of being the organ, instrument, or mouthpiece of the divine will, 
              is the distinguishing characteristic of the prophet.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#3">3</a> 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami apparently possessed this awareness, and in 
              spite of occasional doubts, even serious organisational setbacks 
              and, at times, blunders and errors, he appears never to have wavered 
              from this strongly felt inner conviction.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#4">4</a> 
              This inner conviction of having been called to the prophetic mission 
              gave Bhaktivedanta Swami enormous personal confidence and the courage 
              to persist in reaching his goals. An example of his prophetic confidence 
              is seen in the reflections of a Village Voice reporter (S. Goswami, 
              1980:90-91) who interviewed him on New York's Lower East Side in 
              1966-a time before Prabhupada really had any fully committed devotees: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>I thought his ideas stood a good chance of taking 
                hold, because he seemed so practical. His head didn't seem in 
                the clouds. He wasn't talking mysticism every third word. I guess 
                that's where his soul was, but that is not where his normal conversational 
                consciousness was at. Everything was very practical. <i>Then he 
                talked about temples all over the world, and he said, "Well, we 
                have got a long way to go. But I am very patient.</i>"(my italic) 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In the authentic tradition of prophecy, Prabhupada never 
              presented himself as a religious innovator but as the authorised 
              representative of the divine will. Over and over again, he insisted 
              it was not his personal desire that led him to America, but obedience 
              to his own guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. Typical of his pronouncements 
              is an entry in his diary (S. Goswami, 1980:1) composed aboard the 
              ship during his initial trip to the United States: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>I have left Bharatabhumi just to execute the order 
                of Shri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, in pursuance of Lord Caitanya's 
                order. I have no qualification but have taken up the risk just 
                to carry out the order of His Divine Grace. I depend fully on 
                Their mercy, so far from Vrindavana. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In spite of his highly traditional rhetoric-Prabhupada 
              always presented himself as a part of the Vaishnava disciplic line 
              (<i>parampara</i>)-his leadership was both original and innovative. 
              While he was theologically orthodox, his emphasis on the priesthood 
              of all fully committed Krishna devotees regardless of nationality 
              and family origin, and his willingness to virtually go it alone 
              in the West with little help (and even some opposition) from his 
              own "Godbrothers", differentiates him from other initiated disciples 
              of Bhaktisiddhanta. Bhaktivedanta was no conventional pious priest 
              and devotee, but the prophet of a revitalised Krishna tradition. 
            <p><b>Prabhupada and His Disciples <br>
              </b>Charismatic authority requires more than a leader's inner conviction 
              and confidence: it demands acceptance of the leader's authority 
              by his followers. What was it about Prabhupada that encouraged his 
              disciples-and even some people outside his institutional circle-to 
              view him as an "extraordinary" person worthy of veneration, loyalty 
              and obedience? The young men and women initially attracted to Prabhupada 
              and his teachings-those who recognised him as a charismatic prophet-were, 
              as J. Stillson Judah (1974) explained, people of the counterculture 
              who were searching for an explanation of life's meaning but did 
              not find it or were not satisfied with the answers they did receive 
              from conventional authorities. Many who were attracted to Prabhupada 
              were "seekers"-people who had sought a comprehensive philosophy 
              of life in Marxism, communal living groups, Eastern philosophy, 
              or in psychedelic cultures, but who were never really satisfied 
              with what they found (Selengut, 1989). It was Prabhupada and his 
              presentation of Krishna consciousness which appeared to answer their 
              deepest longings. 
            <p align=LEFT> Many disciples tell of their long spiritual quest which 
              was only satisfied upon meeting and hearing Prabhupada's expositions 
              of Vaishnava philosophy. An early devotee (now a leader in ISKCON) 
              who had been involved in the sixties' counterculture studying with 
              a spiritual teacher in California, tells of his experiences (T.K. 
              Goswami, 1984:12): 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Although I had attended numerous lectures by Ron Lamerick, 
                they consisted mostly of abstract ideas presented in a contrived, 
                complex terminology which I found difficult to remember from one 
                meeting to the next. The meditation sessions had been no less 
                confusing. Each person was encouraged to "travel" out of his body, 
                and upon re-entering, to describe where he or she had been. There 
                was no direction given as to how to channel our energy toward 
                a particular goal. Whatever the goal was, Ron Lamerick had never 
                clearly defined it. Comparing the two, I felt that there was more 
                to gain by hearing Prabhupada lecture. Chanting Hare Krishna was 
                a more tangible process than some vague meditation. 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>In defining what appealed to him about Prabhupada during 
              an interview with me, another early disciple explained, "He had 
              answers about the nature of the soul, the nature of God and the 
              relation between the two... He presented a vocabulary to understand 
              spirituality, and made it real and accessible."<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#5"> 
              5</a> 
            <p align=LEFT>What attracted prospective followers in many instances 
              was the religious message of Krishna consciousness-namely, that 
              human beings are spirit souls whose essential earthly task is to 
              serve God (Krishna) so that they "do not have to take birth again 
              in the material world" and can return to their original, blissful 
              transcendental position in the spiritual world. As one devotee put 
              it: 
            <ul>
              <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada taught us who God is, what our relationship 
                is with Him and how to develop our love for God in our daily lives. 
                My brother and I would always ask ourselves: Where did we come 
                from? Here is this universe, how did it get here? What is behind 
                this and that? But these questions never came up in our social 
                circles. Krishna consciousness answers them clearly and in a non-sentimental 
                way.<a href="4_2charismafoot.html#6">6</a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada, in essence, rejected Western culture and 
              showed his followers a "way out" from the secularisation and functional 
              rationality of modern social systems, a condition in which human 
              activity is unrelated to transcendental meaning. Prabhupada's teachings 
              were a call for the sacralisation of human activity. In practising 
              devotion to the Krishna tradition, disciples were assured that they 
              were participating in the divine plan in which all actions, relationships, 
              and experiences have cosmic meaning. Personal biography and the 
              pains of mundane experience could now be transcended through a life 
              lived in fidelity with Prabhupada's instructions. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada subtly wedded Vaishnava religious philosophy 
              to a radical social critique of Western culture. The beliefs and 
              practices of Krishna consciousness were presented not only as religious 
              obligations, but also as means for the alleviation of the personal 
              and collective malaise engendered by modernity. Prabhupada claimed 
              that the high crime rate, the dissolution of stable family forms, 
              and even the alienated work conditions of many modern societies 
              were attributable, not simply to social or economic causes, but 
              to the absence of a specifically transcendental spirituality and 
              practice centred around devotion to Krishna as God. Reincarnation, 
              vegetarianism, celibacy, Deity worship-central tenets of Krishna 
              consciousness-were shown to be the path to higher spirituality, 
              and also the only authentic "solution" for the problems faced by 
              modern social systems. "He looked at the symptoms of our times", 
              said one devotee, "and could describe very accurately what was going 
              on below the surface." Another disciple put it his way: "It's not 
              lack of food, clothing, or even shelter that's the problem. What 
              Prabhupada showed us was that it is people's refusal to surrender 
              to Krishna, to love and serve Him, that is at the root of the problem." 
            <p align=LEFT>The philosophy of Krishna consciousness, however, is 
              but one element in explaining the early success of ISKCON. Social 
              movements of either a religiously salvationist or politically revolutionary 
              type always present scenarios for personal or social transformation. 
              An attractive worldview promising relief from distress does not, 
              by itself, engender a charismatic movement. What makes such movements 
              possible-at least in the initial phases-is the critical presence 
              of a leader with "extraordinary" qualities to inspire, sustain, 
              embody and articulate the movement's message and vision for would-be 
              joiners and followers. The authentic leader, i.e., the bearer of 
              charisma, "radiates a buoyant self-confidence in the rightness and 
              goodness of the aims he proclaims for his movement" (Tucker, 1970:87). 
              Moreover, he shows a stubborn "self-confidence and faith in the 
              movement's prospects" for success. 
            <p align=LEFT>Prabhupada was experienced by others as such a personality. 
              From available sources, we get the sense of a leader who, in spite 
              of setbacks and periodic doubts, was convinced of the final success 
              of his vision. It was this self-confidence-derived both from the 
              inspiration and authority given to him by his own guru (and thus, 
              according to Indian tradition, by Krishna himself acting through 
              the guru), and from his own prophetic stature-by which he was to 
              be successful in spreading Krishna consciousness throughout much 
              of the world. 
            <p align=LEFT>The acceptance of Prabhupada as a charismatic prophet 
              and teacher endowed his person and directives with sacred authority. 
              For his disciples, Prabhupada's instructions were seen as emanating 
              from divine reality and were identified with that ultimate realm 
              of truth. There was little reason for disciples to evaluate his 
              pronouncements, viewpoints, or authority in the context of any other 
              social, ethical or religious system. The fact that what Prabhupada 
              decreed might be "wrong" by prevailing scientific or moral standards 
              would not be reason for its rejection. Ultimately, prophetic authority 
              is not predicated on human understanding or social acceptability 
              but upon faith in the charismatic person, who is known to represent 
              transcendental truth. In obedience to Prabhupada, the early ISKCON 
              followers felt themselves to be "in tune with the Universe", while 
              disobedience was seen as denying the fundamental order of God's 
              will. Living in accordance with the prophet's directives is to be 
              in harmony with the essential nature of the cosmos. To deny or to 
              disobey this authority is to be removed from that order and to invite 
              the terrors of suffering, anomie and chaos on the self.
