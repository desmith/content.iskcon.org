            <p align=left><a href="../contributors.html#Davies"><b>Sefton Davies</b></a><b><br>
              </b>&nbsp; 
            <p>I read with interest and compassion the article "Devotees and Their 
              Parents" by Dhyana-kunda-devi dasi in the June 1996 issue of this 
              journal. As parent to a Hare Krishna devotee, I was interested to 
              obtain an insight into "the other side" of a problem I had faced. 
              I empathised with both the devotee and her parents in their struggle 
              to reconcile widely differing values and beliefs, but felt that 
              the unusual circumstances and the extreme nature of the example 
              provided might well detract from its usefulness to others involved 
              in this dilemma. As I read it I wanted to say, "but it isn't always 
              like that". So this article presents a different picture, as viewed 
              by a parent, not a devotee. Let me emphasise that it is only one 
              view, that it is no more typical than Dhyana's, and that it is a 
              very personal view which is not necessarily shared by all members 
              of the family.<a
 href="#1">1</a> However, I hope it may be helpful to parents who, like myself, 
              have confronted the problem of their child's adoption of beliefs 
              alien to their own. 
            <p>In our attic there is a large box of photographs, some carefully 
              mounted in albums, others in the jumble which many photographs share 
              when the immediate thrill of viewing wears off. Most of them are 
              photographs tracing the history of our family from my own childhood 
              (or before) through to happy scenes of parenthood-on beaches, at 
              birthday parties, at family gatherings.. Reviewing them stimulates 
              a vivid reliving of the emotions experienced at the time, and provides 
              a chronicle of the joys and pains which constitute this, the most 
              loving of all relationships. But they also provoke a greater understanding 
              of my own development as a sentient being-of my developing spiritual 
              beliefs, my changing (hopefully diminishing!) psychological hang-ups, 
              my prejudices and commitments. And it is this interaction between 
              my internal thoughts and emotions, and the outside world of family 
              events which has helped shape my relationships with those closest 
              to me-in particular my daughter, Caron, or Keshava-devi dasi as 
              she now is. 
            <p>The early photographs show an apparently (how can any of us be 
              certain?) care-free young girl in the perpetually sunlit tropical 
              environment of Malaya where I worked; in the garden, on glorious 
              beaches, at birthday parties with other European, Chinese or Indian 
              children, etc., etc.; then to England, and the extended family album 
              of grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins; primary school, where 
              her quick intelligence made her favourite with teachers and less 
              favourite with some classmates, but still the photographs show the 
              protected world of a loving and reasonably well-integrated family; 
              and so to secondary school, college and university, where they show 
              a mature young person striving to find her own identity outside 
              the moulding influences of the home, trying to reconcile the conflicting 
              values of parents and peers, questioning the ambitions imposed on 
              her by loving, but sometimes too certain, parents. 
            <p>This kaleidoscope of human development is, however, only the facade 
              which conceals the 'unknown-to-others' reality of growing up; a 
              reality only barely guessed at by parents-some more accurately than 
              others. In Dhyana-kunda devi dasi's case the result was conflict- 
              "the war was long and painful";<a href="#2">2</a> in Caron's it 
              was a gentler withdrawal from the path laid down by us-of University, 
              profession, marriage-and a journey along her own path into a world 
              completely alien to us, of a drop-out culture. Gentler, but not 
              so very different from Dhyana-kunda's in its result. The flight 
              to Ireland with strongly feminist friends, a pilgrimage of rejection 
              of the middle-class certainties of possessions, ambition and neatness, 
              leading to a plunge into religion-at first into a New Age-type twentieth-century 
              invented replica of some ancient, but long-forgotten, matriarchal 
              society, from which she had, literally, to escape, and then, after 
              a further period of soul-searching in our 'Godless' home, back to 
              Ireland and Hare Krishna. 
            <p>So far, seemingly not very different from Dhyana's story. But, 
              we did not "kick" Caron "out of the house", nor did she have to 
              "sue (us) in the courts". The feelings I experienced (I emphasise 
              that I speak only for myself, and not necessarily for any other 
              members of the family) were probably those of many parents whose 
              children choose to make a major break with the cultural norms of 
              the home and the local community. They were: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>I was disappointed that she had left University, because she 
                had a very high potential in her subject field, and I believe 
                that we should all strive to achieve our potential in life. This 
                potential I measured in terms of her use of the intellectual gifts 
                with which she is endowed, which I believed to be circumscribed 
                by the limitations imposed by her new beliefs (e.g., in the literature 
                she read, the music she played). </li>
              <li>I feared for her because she had no job.</li>
              <li>I was fearful of the brainwashing I associated with all but 
                the 'respectable' religions; a concern justified in the somewhat 
                sinister circumstances of her first religious conversion and her 
                having to escape from it. </li>
              <li>I lost sleep over her alienation from her friends and ourselves, 
                because she appeared judgmental and disapproving of our lifestyle, 
                values and philosophical beliefs. </li>
              <li>I was irritated by what I regarded as the pseudo-scientific 
                sibboleths relating to food, clothing, etc., and in particular 
                the adoption of Indian dress, diet, medicine, etc., which I believed 
                to be unnecessary adjuncts to religious belief and artificial 
                in that they did not grow out of the cultural context in which 
                Caron lived. My daughter was born European, not Indian, and I 
                resented what I perceived as the brainwashing which converted 
                her into something alien. </li>
              <li>I could not understand how my daughter, whom I had encouraged 
                to be logical and intellectually sceptical of unsubstantiated 
                dogma, could swallow the myths she was taught. What I could not 
                accept was that I had brought her up to think for herself, but 
                when she did, I was angry that she did not think as I did! </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This was not a very encouraging scenario for continuing good relations 
              with my daughter and her new associates! However, my feelings moved 
              gradually from a somewhat self-centred concern for my own feelings, 
              to a greater concern for Caron's welfare and happiness. It was necessary 
              for me to realise that I do not own my children and that I must 
              not control them. In this process I was helped enormously by my 
              own process of self-discovery which enabled me to redefine relationships 
              and my own philosophy. I learned that I can be responsible only 
              for my own actions, and not anyone else's, and that I must not blame 
              anyone else for their consequences; that I need the help and support 
              of others in making wise decisions, and that others equally need 
              my help and support, but not my interference, in making theirs; 
              and that true love is an unselfish, often inconvenient, willingness 
              to help others realise their potential for full and creative living, 
              while evil is anything which diminishes others' potential for fulfilment. 
              I also, at that time, rejected formal religion, because, while I 
              live in awe of the wonder of creation and reject materialism as 
              the basis for humane relationships and social harmony, I have no 
              experience of any of the religious Gods (Christian, Hindu, Muslim, 
              etc.). I subscribe to Buddha's advice to 'know only that which is 
              in your own experience'. In answer to the inevitable question from 
              my daughter and son-in-law, 'But what do you think is the purpose 
              of life?', I can say with certainty only that I don't know. In my 
              wickeder moments I say, 'Ask a mayfly', because a mayfly is born 
              with no stomach and lives for only 24 hours, during which it reproduces 
              itself and then dies. 
            <p>So, here I am, an agnostic parent with a deeply religious daughter 
              and son-in-law, both of whom live a life-style vastly different 
              from my own! Yet my relationship with them is richer now than it 
              has ever been. What have been the ingredients of this relatively 
              peaceful conversion? How do I seek to reconcile two such widely 
              variant philosophical viewpoints? What have been, and still remain 
              my problems in adapting to a family relationship so different from 
              my expectations? Are there any indicators for other parents with 
              Hare Krishna offspring? Let me try to unravel this most complicated 
              of puzzles. I think there are basic principles which can be applied 
              to all human relationships: 
            <p><b>Acceptance of Human Individuality and Respect for Others' Autonomy<br>
              </b>I subscribe to Fritz Perl's "Gestalt Prayer", which reads: 
            <ul>
              <p>I do my thing, and you do your thing. <br>
                I am not in this world to live up to your expectations, <br>
                and you are not in this world to live up to mine. <br>
                You are you and I am I <br>
                and if by chance we meet, it's beautiful. <br>
                if not, it can't be helped. 
            </ul>
            <p>I am prepared, therefore, for Caron to 'do her thing', so long 
              as it does not prevent others (I suppose particularly me) from doing 
              theirs. It is in this that I take issue with Dhyana, who believes 
              that "preaching to parents is a challenge". I fully appreciate that 
              it is incumbent on devotees to spread Krishna consciousness, and 
              I respect Caron's dedication to preaching, but I am not in the business 
              of prescribing her behaviour, as I was when she was young and inexperienced 
              and needed mature guidance (albeit sometimes inappropriate), and 
              I do not wish her to prescribe mine. If we can agree on issues, 
              it's beautiful, but if we disagree, it can't be helped, and it need 
              not vitiate our love for each other and our respect for each others' 
              autonomy. It was only when I was able to let go of my need to control 
              my child's behaviour that I was able to relate to her in a way which 
              has led to deeper trust and understanding; I believe it is equally 
              important that children should let go of their need to preach to 
              parents. 
            <p><b>Keep in Touch<br>
              </b>One of the most painful aspects of Dhyana's story to me was 
              the breakdown of relationships between mother and daughter-"no visits, 
              no letters"-which, fortunately, has been healed. I have endeavoured 
              to avoid such a break because, without contact, understanding and 
              love are not possible. It is, therefore, important for me to show 
              that, even when I disagree with someone's views, or even behaviour, 
              I still love them as a person; indeed, I believe this to be a fundamental 
              principle of a moral life. It is, however, possible to implement 
              the principle only if one accepts the other's right to autonomy 
              and is prepared to make the effort to understand their point of 
              view-and this applies equally to parent and child. 
            <p><b>A Willingness to Listen<br>
              </b>I know now that I used not to listen to my children-partly because 
              I believed that, as an older person, I knew better, partly because 
              I was too keen to speak myself. I now try hard (though not always 
              successfully) to listen openly and to assess what is being said, 
              without the urgent need to respond. I believe this to be an essential 
              skill for parents whose children have chosen beliefs, values and 
              behaviour different from their own. Curiously, if you listen, you 
              might just learn something! I have learned a great deal about ISKCON 
              and the tenets of the Hare Krishna faith, and I have learned to 
              respect much of what Caron believes: I was already largely vegetarian 
              (although I occasionally cheat), so that was no problem; I respect 
              their non-materialistic philosophy (but find it difficult to apply 
              to my own creature comforts); I admire the striving for humility; 
              I like their quietness; I understand their rejection of stimulants; 
              and I wish more people would emulate their morality. More than that, 
              I have become interested in her life within the movement, and enjoy 
              talking to her and Shaunaka about developments within the temple 
              and ISKCON generally. I am thus enabled to share my daughter's joys 
              and concerns once more, but hopefully without the need to influence 
              her and control her life. Although I have been particularly fortunate 
              in having a son-in-law that I can relate well to and a daughter 
              who shares many of my non-spiritual beliefs, I am convinced that 
              most parents would find it easier to accept their children's 'conversion' 
              if they listened, took an interest and tried to understand. 
            <p><b> A Willingness to Modify one's Behaviour without Being Submissive<br>
              </b>I respect Caron's new beliefs and am sometimes willing to modify 
              my behaviour to meet her spiritual needs, but I am not prepared 
              to abandon my own beliefs. Therefore, when I visit Caron, or stay 
              at a temple I respect their way of life: I am willing to remove 
              my shoes on entering, to abstain from drinking coffee or alcohol, 
              to eat the food they cook, etc. However, when she visits me, I expect 
              equal respect for my way of living. I will obviously consider their 
              particular needs and show them every hospitality, but I am not prepared 
              to give up my evening glass of wine, or my meals made with onions 
              or mushrooms, or to watch my favourite television programmes. I 
              will happily make some soup with onions and some without, so that 
              we can both enjoy my <i>cordon bleu</i> offerings, and I will video 
              my TV programmes so that I can watch when it does not interfere 
              with our social interaction; but she is 'not in this world to live 
              up to my expectations', nor am 'I in this world to live up to' hers. 
              I have an equal right with her to live as I wish in my own home; 
              I do not, therefore, "hide all forbidden substances", as does Dhyana's 
              mother, nor would I respect Caron if she pressured me to do so, 
              just as she would be angry if I asked her not to use incense when 
              I visit her. When she visits me, I am happy for her to chant her 
              rounds at some unearthly hour, but I expect her to do it somewhere 
              where the sound will not wake me up. So, I urge tolerance and a 
              willingness by parents and offspring alike to turn a blind eye at 
              behaviour which is different, so long as it is not offensive 
            <p><b>Focus on Similarities, Rather than Differences<br>
              </b>When Caron first joined ISKCON, and my concerns were most powerful, 
              I made an effort to find out as much as possible, without becoming 
              a devotee, about her new beliefs, and honestly to assess them in 
              relation to my own. I found that there were surprisingly few differences 
              (if one can set aside the enormous difference between faith and 
              agnosticism) sufficiently important to cause me any angst. Most 
              of the differences referred to diet, dress, etc., and my only serious 
              persisting concern is her lack of financial security, since she 
              has chosen to devote her time almost entirely to the movement, but 
              not to live in an ashrama. However, that is her choice, and she 
              must accept the consequences-though I would, of course, help her 
              in a serious emergency (of which there have been none-perhaps she 
              is right, and Krishna provides!). I think it important for parents 
              of devotees to look at their children's behaviour, and answer in 
              total honesty the question, 'Do I really disapprove of that?' 
            <p><b>A Sense of Humour Helps<br>
              </b>A willingness to laugh at one's own foibles and weaknesses and 
              to accept loving teasing helps lower the tension which can exist 
              when different behaviours meet. When I ring Caron on December 25 
              and greet her with 'Hare Christmas', it is the sort of pathetic 
              schoolboy humour I am capable of, but it does demonstrate that I 
              am not hung-up about her religion. And since she is willing to respond 
              with some similar quip, I feel that we have taken the tensions which 
              once existed out of our changed relationship. My only really serious 
              concern is for Caron's well-being, so the rest can be viewed with 
              a smile on my face. 
            <p>And so, I celebrate the new relationship I have with my daughter, 
              and the learning which has occurred along the way, because I know 
              that I am a more complete person as a result. It has not been an 
              easy process, but effective learning rarely is; and I know that 
              there is still work to be done to maintain and further develop this 
              relationship. However, I have recorded my story in this way in the 
              hope that it may help other parents and their devotee children to 
              find their own way to the fulfilment and contentment which we all 
              seek.
