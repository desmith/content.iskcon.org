            <p><b>Catholic Attitudes to Hinduism and to ISKCON<br>
              </b>It is also legitimate to raise the question whether the Catholic 
              Church is ready for an encounter with ISKCON. The Catholic Church 
              has, since Vatican II, pursued a programme of intensive dialogue 
              with people of different faiths, a dialogue which might be extended 
              or modified to include minority religious groups that have sprouted 
              in the West over the last three decades. Because of ISKCON's links 
              with Hinduism, it might be useful to start with an examination of 
              the Catholic Church's relationship with this Eastern religion. 
            <p><b>Catholicism and Hinduism<br>
              </b>The Roman Catholic adoption of dialogue as a mode of inter-religious 
              relationship is a relatively recent development. The tendency of 
              pre-Vatican II Catholic writers had been to underline the differences 
              between Christianity and Hinduism, and to attempt to demonstrate 
              the inferiority of the latter.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#34"><sup>34</sup></a> 
              In the late 1950s, for example, Thomas McDonnell, in his explanation 
              of the "March Mission Intention of the Society for the Propagation 
              of the Faith" describes Hinduism as "the religion of negativeness", 
              that is, in some regards, "essentially different from Catholicism."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#35"><sup>35</sup></a> 
            <p> One must stress, however, that in spite of the goal of conversion 
              that was foremost in Catholic missionary and evangelisation efforts, 
              the underlying affinity between Catholicism and Hinduism was, at 
              times, accepted, even before Vatican II. Thus, for example, writing 
              in an Irish journal in the late 1920s, P. Johanns stated that "it 
              is as easy, if not easier, to build our Catholic philosophy on Indian 
              than on Greek soil."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#36"><sup>36</sup></a> 
              He then attempts to shown how Shankara's Vedanta philosophy could 
              become the foundation of Indian Catholicism. Other Catholic writers, 
              like Geoffrey Ashe, are more cautious but still maintain that an 
              interpretation of the Vedanta acceptable to both Catholics and Hindus 
              can be worked out.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#37"> <sup>37</sup></a> 
              Writing in a popular magazine Herman D'Souza avoids a blanket condemnation 
              of Hinduism and acknowledges that truth can be found in this ancient 
              Eastern religion.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#38"><sup>38</sup></a> 
              Even those who look down on Hinduism admit that "it has doctrines 
              and practices astonishingly similar to certain features of Catholicism: 
              revelation and traditions, sacraments and sacramentals, special 
              religious vestments, elaborate ceremonial in worship, images, lights, 
              bells, incense, processions, and so forth."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#39"><sup>39</sup></a> 
              Thomas Srinivasan, a Hindu convert to Catholicism, although he presents 
              a derogatory picture of his erstwhile faith, concludes that "there 
              is a fundamental affinity between the soul of the Hindu and that 
              of Catholicism."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#40"><sup>40</sup></a> 
            <p> The Catholic attitude towards Hinduism has improved immeasurably 
              since Vatican II, whose declaration on non-Christian faiths opened 
              a new era in inter-faith relationships. Though some Catholic writers 
              are still hesitant of the new approach,<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#41"><sup>41</sup></a> 
              most have accepted and furthered the work of the Council. The Catholic 
              response to Hinduism has always been milder than that of evangelical 
              and fundamentalist Christianity, and consequently more open to dialogue.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#42"><sup>42</sup></a> 
              It has acknowledged that human and spiritual values can be found 
              in other religions-including Hinduism. Official Catholic and scholarly 
              writings do not adopt a tone of condemnation or critique when discussing 
              other faiths, but rather admit that other religions express genuine 
              religious experiences and are indicative of the presence of God's 
              grace. The encounter with other faiths is considered to be a constructive 
              challenge that can have beneficial results-such as the removal of 
              prejudices and the inner purification and conversion-which are ongoing 
              processes in the lives of members of all religions. Even in popular 
              Catholic literature, it would be hard to find attacks against or 
              blanket denunciations of Hinduism. 
            <p>There is little doubt that there has been a maturation in the Catholic 
              evaluation and appreciation of other religions.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#43"><sup>43</sup></a> 
              The question is whether Catholics are willing and ready to extend 
              their openness and understanding to newer religious groups. 
            <p><b>Catholicism and ISKCON<br>
              </b>The apparent reluctance of the Catholic Church to engage in 
              dialogue with new religious movements can be traced to several factors, 
              namely: (1) the lack of knowledge about them; (2) the great diversity 
              that exists between the various groups; (3) the public antagonism 
              against them; and (4) the fear that dialogue might be misinterpreted 
              as an approval of the movements' beliefs and practices and might 
              contribute to the legitimisation of their presence in the West. 
              In a recent document, "Dialogue and Proclamation", the new religious 
              movements are explicitly omitted from consideration "due to the 
              diversity of situations which these movements present and the need 
              for discernment on the human and religious values which each contains."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#44"><sup>44</sup></a> 
            <p> This cautionary statement, however, can hardly be interpreted 
              as a refusal to carry on a dialogue with those movements that are 
              open to establish better relationships with the traditional churches. 
              If dialogue is an essential "part of the total mission of the Church,"<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#45"><sup>45</sup></a> 
              then nobody should be left out. In 1991, the Synod of African Bishops, 
              in a lengthy document that dealt with the evangelisation of Christianity 
              in Africa, directly faced the issue of dialogue with sects and new 
              religious movements. While admitting that these groups raised some 
              new questions for the Church, the bishops included them in the Church's 
              efforts to carry on a dialogue with other religions. They wrote: 
            <ul>
              <p>Pastoral care in the renewal of the Christian community ought 
                to be complemented by a sincere concern for dialogue-ecumenical 
                and inter-religious, according to circumstances-with followers 
                of new religious movements. Even if this dialogue is often difficult, 
                because of an unyielding fundamentalism or aggressive proselytising 
                by certain groups, it is necessary in the community to seek to 
                develop a Christ-like spirit in relation to all, making the effort 
                to understand them and to enter into dialogue with them.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#46"> 
                <sup>46</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p>One must confess that dialogue with some of the new religious movements 
              may not be possible, either because they are not willing to establish 
              such a relationship or because their activities cannot be harmonised 
              with the requirements of dialogue. However, most of these reasons 
              given to reject or delay dialogue with the new religions do not 
              seem to carry much weight in the case of the Hare Kåñëa movement. 
              The issue about human and religious values, raised in "Dialogue 
              and Proclamation", cannot be applied to ISKCON, since this religious 
              faith falls within traditional Hinduism, whose human and spiritual 
              values are not in doubt and with whom a relationship of dialogue 
              has already been established. Kenny's argument about the lack of 
              any official authority in ISKCON is not convincing, since it can 
              be applied to Hinduism in general as well as to some other religious 
              groups. 
            <p><b>Catholic Reactions to ISKCON<br>
              </b>Catholic reactions to ISKCON have been somewhat mixed. The general 
              tendency has been to denounce it as a spurious religious movement, 
              even though some more moderate views about ISKCON can be found in 
              Catholic literature.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#47"><sup>47</sup></a> 
              Most of the Catholic reactions to ISKCON date from the 1970s and 
              1980s; little has been written about the movement in the 1990s. 
              This might suggest that the general antagonism is waning, a trend 
              that corresponds to the changes taking place within ISKCON itself 
              and to the public's perception of it as an annoying proselytising 
              movement in search of converts. 
            <p>Two recent Catholic commentators on ISKCON deserve mention. Patrick 
              Smith wrote a lengthy essay dedicated largely to expounding ISKCON's 
              theology.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#48"><sup>48</sup></a> He 
              acknowledges the Hindu roots of the movement, but makes no attempt 
              to deal with its relationship with other religions or with the Catholic 
              Church in particular. Noticing the strife within the movement and 
              the attempts at reform, he thinks it unlikely that its membership 
              will increase. His approach, however, is respectful of the beliefs 
              of ISKCON and is in harmony with the principles of dialogue. Michael 
              Barnes, in a short editorial, reflects favourably on an inter-faith 
              conference held at the Bhaktivedanta Manor (U.K.). While drawing 
              attention to the obvious theological differences between the two 
              faiths, Barnes comments that "the one we spoke of as Lord was approached 
              in the same way-with a form of prayer which was, in the best sense, 
              sacramental." <a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#49"><sup>49</sup></a> 
              Barnes found dialogue with members of ISKCON both possible and fruitful. 
            <p><b>Difficulties in the Encounter between the Catholic Church and 
              ISKCON<br>
              </b>Many of the obstacles that stand in the way of dialogue between 
              the traditional churches and the new religious movements have been 
              discussed at some length elsewhere.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#50"><sup>50</sup></a> 
              Here it suffices to dwell on one major problem shared by both ISKCON 
              and the Catholic Church. Since both faiths are evangelical and both 
              give paramount importance to mission, the question arises whether 
              these motives and goals are compatible with genuine religious dialogue. 
            <p> These issues have been dealt with at length in official Catholic 
              circles. Since Vatican II's decree on mission,<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#51"><sup>51</sup></a> 
              several Catholic documents have addressed the theology of mission, 
              evangelisation, and dialogue, and have attempted to draw up the 
              relationships between these religiously-oriented activities.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#52"><sup>52</sup></a> 
              In "Dialogue and Proclamation", a distinction is made between the 
              Church's evangelising mission (or evangelisation), dialogue ("inter-religious 
              relations with individuals and communities of other faiths which 
              are directed at mutual understanding and enrichment"), proclamation 
              (communication of the Gospel message), and conversion (the movement 
              towards God; embracing the faith). The document sees dialogue and 
              the preaching of the good news as part of the evangelising mission 
              of the Church. <a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#53"><sup>53</sup></a> 
            <p> What these documents try to do is to find some balance between 
              the Church's mission of proclaiming the good news which is partly 
              aimed at conversion and the demands of genuine dialogue which is 
              not geared to urge other people to switch their religious allegiances, 
              recognises the genuineness of other faiths, and respects the freedom 
              of the individuals to make choices in accordance with their consciences. 
              Such balance is achieved by a different kind of theology of religions 
              that acknowledges truth and value in other religions and that is 
              willing to be enriched by an encounter with people of other faiths.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#54"><sup>54</sup></a> 
            <p>This refined theology of mission is apparent in the manner in which 
              the very concepts of evangelisation and conversion are being rethought. 
              Thus Pope Paul VI, in his encyclical on evangelisation, stressed 
              that the main purpose of evangelisation is interior change. The 
              Church, he adds, 
            <ul>
              <p>seeks to convert solely through the divine power of the message 
                she proclaims, both the personal and collective consciences of 
                the people, the activities in which they engage, their way of 
                life, and the actual milieu in which they live.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#55"><sup>55</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p>This modern interpretation of evangelisation is often reflected 
              in the writings of Catholic theologians in Asia.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#56"><sup>56</sup></a> 
            <p>Efforts are also being made for an understanding of conversion 
              that is more compatible with the requirements of dialogue.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#57"><sup>57</sup></a> 
              Heavy proselytisation efforts are shunned and rejected. In a recent 
              Hindu-Christian encounter that explores the ways both religions 
              could work for harmony, the issue of conversion was directly faced. 
              In a joint statement by the participants it was stated that: 
            <ul>
              <p>Dialogue aimed at "converting" the other to one's own religious 
                faith and tradition is dishonest and unethical; it is not the 
                way of harmony. 
            </ul>
            <p>Further, 
            <ul>
              <p>While acknowledging the fundamental right of every person to 
                religious freedom, we should unambiguously oppose all forms of 
                coercion or enticement to win over believers of other religions 
                to one's own religious community.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#58"><sup>58</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p align=LEFT><b>Suggestions for a Dialogue with ISKCON<br>
              </b>It is certainly time for the Catholic Church to consider establishing 
              some formal relationship with ISKCON. Bearing in mind that different 
              forms of dialogue are possible<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#59"><sup>59</sup></a>

              circumstances,"<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#60"><sup>60</sup></a> 
              several possible options (which are not mutually exclusive) for 
              an inter-religious dialogue with ISKCON are possible: 
            <ol type="1">
              <li>one that incorporates ISKCON in the broader exchanges between 
                the Roman Catholic Church and other religions. Such a dialogue 
                has already started in some parts of the Western world where ISKCON 
                participates in inter-faith councils.<a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#61"><sup>61</sup></a></li>
              <li>one which includes representatives of the Catholic Church in 
                meetings between leaders of both newer and older religious groups, 
                meetings that began in San Francisco several years ago.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#62"><sup>62</sup> 
                </a> </li>
              <li>one that accepts ISKCON within the framework of the current 
                Catholic-Hindu dialogue.</li>
              <li>one which brings together several new religious groups of Hindu 
                origin.</li>
              <li>one that is restricted to sessions between representatives of 
                ISKCON and the Catholic Church.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As was pointed out at the beginning of this paper, the current 
              religious scene calls for an examination of the relationship between 
              the mainline churches and the new religions. While admitting that 
              not all new religious movements are willing and/or ready for dialogue, 
              it is imperative that a better rapport with them be pursued and 
              that a more wholesome relationship be established between those 
              who have shown their willingness to engage in mutual theological 
              reflections and common religious and/or humanitarian projects. The 
              initiation of formal dialogue with ISKCON, besides having the advantages 
              of dialogue with the major religions, may contribute to the solution 
              of some of the problems brought about by the presence of newer religious 
              alternatives. It may also serve as a model for relating with other 
              new religions that have sprouted in the West over the last twenty-five 
              years.
