            <p>Prof. Acharuparambil attempts "to uncover some of the rather difficult 
              problems that a Christian encounters in his effort to undertake 
              serious dialogue with a Hindu", and he sets out to do this in an 
              admirably dialogic fashion. Sympathetically entering into the Hindu 
              world-view, he has envisioned how his own Christian position appears 
              from the perspective of the other. 
            <p>I am afraid that in doing this, however, Prof. Acharuparambil has 
              inadvertently transgressed his own dictum regarding interreligious 
              dialogue: "Religious systems do not meet, but religious people...do." 
              He notes that in dialogue the participants try to "witness to what 
              is specific and personal in their religious convictions and experiences...", 
              yet he has taken what ought to be seen as the specific and personal 
              witness of a certain group of Hindus-Swami Vivekananda, S. Radhakrishnan, 
              Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi-as in fact the normative 
              Hindu religious system itself. 
            <p>He is certainly not the first to fall-or be lured-into this particular 
              trap. It happened to me, too. When I began graduate work in religion 
              studies during the late sixties, my first teachers of Hinduism-three-fourths 
              of them Hindus by birth and one of those a scholarly sannyasin in 
              the Ramakrishna Mission-led me to believe that "Hinduism" denoted 
              precisely the monistic Advaita Vedanta of Shankaracarya. While the 
              existence of other communities-like that of the devotional, monotheistic 
              Vaishnava community to which I now belong-was of course recognised, 
              the practices of such communities were explicated entirely within 
              the framework of Advaitic theology. Their own self-understanding 
              or interpretation was either not presented, or dismissed out-of-hand. 
              Thus, my first Hinduism teacher, Swami Nikhilananda (a direct disciple 
              of Swami Vivekananda), presented what was in fact the teachings 
              of a particular community-the Rämakrishna Mission-as the normative 
              and universal belief of all Hindus, without telling us he was doing 
              so. Prof. Acharuparambil is only one of a great many people to have 
              been misled by this practice. 
            <p>Let me continue with my own story, for it will speak to other points 
              raised by Prof. Acharuparambil. While I was still in graduate school, 
              I encountered devotees from ISKCON-a contemporary continuation of 
              the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. It was only through them and the 
              writings of their teacher, Shrila Prabhupada, that I heard the theistic 
              Vedanta expounded with skill and conviction. By that time, I had 
              become pretty much of a Shankarite myself, at least on the level 
              of thought. As a typical product of modernity, I had come of age 
              steeped in a relativistic notion of truth. As a result, for me any 
              absolute could be characterised only as "nothing" (the profane void) 
              or-alternately-as "Nothing" (the sacred void). You can see here 
              the appeal of Shankaracarya: his "unqualified Brahman" was cognitively 
              the same as my "Nothing", and his "religious relativism" (to use 
              Prof. Acharuparambil's term) comfortably congruent with my modern 
              relativism. 
            <p>However, through Prabhupada's writings I became convinced that 
              the theistic Vedanta of Ramanujacarya and others was true and correct<a href="#1">1</a> 
              and that Shankaracarya's exposition was systematically misleading. 
              I became convinced about the Personality of the Absolute-that is, 
              of a transcendent Personality of Godhead, a personage- <i>pace</i> 
              Shankaracarya-not a product of the relative, illusory world. When 
              I found myself forced to confess the truth of a universal individual, 
              I realised that in certain respects I was now disconcertingly close 
              to the Christianity I thought I had long ago "outgrown". The return 
              of long dormant Christian recollections brought in its train a kind 
              of panic or paranoia: In becoming a devotee of Krishna, was I perhaps 
              being mislead by Satan (the founder-according to the evangelists 
              of my childhood-of all "other religions")? 
            <p>To resolve this doubt, I reread the four gospels, half-expecting-even 
              half- hoping-to be dissuaded from my course. Unexpectedly, this 
              reading of the Gospels evoked the faith to surrender to Krishna. 
              With astonishment and increasing elation, I found the gospels had 
              become alive and relevant to me in a way that they had never been 
              before. I recognised that Jesus Christ was a perfect Vaishnava and 
              His message exactingly faithful to that of <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> 
              and <i>Shrimad Bhagavatam</i>. For the first time, the meaning became 
              clear to me of Jesus' example and command to His followers to fully 
              surrender to God: "Take up the cross and follow Me." It is unfortunate 
              that in my younger days this summons had become subverted by a certain 
              understanding of the doctrine of "vicarious atonement", in which 
              Jesus' paying the penalty for our sins was somehow taken as <i>exempting</i> 
              us from having to follow Him, rather than as <i>enabling</i> us 
              to do so. 
            <p>I recount my story not only to respond to Prof. Acharuparambil's 
              call to "witness what is specific and personal", but also because 
              the story sheds light on my own orientation-as an individual Gaudiya 
              Vaishnava-toward some of the major concerns in Prof. Acharuparambil's 
              reflections. Let me elaborate on some of them. 
            <p>We should recognise that Advaita Vedanta is not "Hinduism." In 
              fact, I would argue that nothing is "Hinduism"; that there is no 
              such -ism. "Hinduism" refers to a many-branched family of related 
              religious traditions. They posses a "family resemblance", but that 
              resemblance-in the form of persisting or reoccurring patterns of 
              common material-does not constitute an "-ism". Indeed, if you group 
              all the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian traditions under a single 
              "-ism"-call it "Semitism" or "Abrahamism" <a href="#2">2</a> -you 
              would have something approaching "Hinduism". In fact, "Hindu" is 
              not a Sanskrit word; it does not occur in the Vedas. It comes, apparently, 
              from Muslim conquers, who used it to name the people living beyond 
              the Sindhu River. Only over against the Islamic culture of the Arabic 
              and Turkish occupiers of India did the word "Hindu" call into being 
              the group it names. 
            <p>In the form of theistic commentaries on the Vedanta-Sutra, the 
              major scholars of the Vaishnava, or theistic, communities-such as 
              Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Nimbarka, Baladeva Vidyabhushana-articulated 
              their theology of the transcendent personality of Godhead in opposition 
              to the monism of Shankaracarya. For these Vaishnava thinkers, divine 
              revelation is quite definite and specific. On the other hand, the 
              quest for the formless, featureless absolute; the legitimisation 
              of worshipping many gods as equally valid practices; the reduction 
              of the world to mere illusion with neither substance nor connection 
              to the absolute; the ultimate devalorization of devotional acts 
              and practices-all these features, which for Prof. Acharuparambil 
              are defining characteristics of Hinduism, are rejected by thinkers 
              whose "orthodox Hindu" credentials are as impeccable as Shankaracarya's. 
            <p>The actual situation is this: Within the Hindu family of traditions, 
              the dialectic between what Christians call "positive theology" and 
              "negative theology" has run a long and profound course. The Vaishnavas 
              are those who have concluded that there is a positive theology (and 
              associated spirituality) that transcends the negative, even while 
              including the truths of the later within itself. 
            <p>Christianity is based on a positive revelation-or a series of them-while 
              its vital inheritance from Greek metaphysics and spirituality has 
              brought in a potent and enduring strain of negative theology. The 
              history of Christian spirituality and reflection also discloses 
              a dialectic between the positive and negative modes of theology 
              and spirituality. Christians and Vaishnavas who can affirm a transcendent 
              personality as the outcome of such a dialectic might have much they 
              can productively share with each other. 
            <p>To put it another way, Christian and Hindu theists may have more 
              in common with each other than they do with the more impersonalistically 
              inclined members of their own religions. After all, the faithful 
              Christian really does not encounter the relativising, unique-authority-denying, 
              institution-minimising, "it's-all-one-anyway"-amorphousizing, syncretizing, 
              impersonalist only in the person of the Hindu. He meets him-much 
              more frequently and more disturbingly-in his own church, kneeling 
              next to him in the same pew. 
            <p>For example, Prof. Acharuparambil singles out a statement by Gandhi 
              because it illustrates "with extreme clarity the typical Hindu mentality: 
              'I must say that I was never interested in an historical Jesus. 
              I should not care if it was proved by someone that the man called 
              Jesus never lived, and that what was narrated in the Gospel was 
              a figment of the writer's imagination. For the Sermon on the Mount 
              would still be true to me.'" I cannot count the number of times 
              I have heard similar statements from practising Christians-Protestant 
              and Roman Catholics alike, many of them, indeed, ministers and priests. 
              I am sure Prof. Acharuparambil is keenly aware of their presence, 
              and I suspect he is implicitly as much engaged with them as he is 
              with the Hindu impersonalists when he reflects upon the obstacles 
              to dialogue. 
            <p>The apparent steady increase in the number of such people should 
              not be attributed to some inherent potency of monistic Hinduism. 
              The cause will rather be found in certain aspects of Western modernity, 
              aspects which then converge upon features of impersonalistic Hinduism. 
            <p>Prof. Acharuparambil asserts that "religious relativism" is as 
              "old as Hinduism itself", but he notes that "in modern times Hindu 
              leaders have seriously deepened it". What Prof. Acharuparambil calls 
              "deepening" (a misnomer, I believe) is really a revisioning of the 
              traditional Advaita Vedanta on the part of certain Westernised Hindu 
              intellectuals-like Tagore, Vivekananda, Gandhi and Radhakrishnan-to 
              accommodate their received faith to modernity. These modernising 
              Hindus all tend to accept central tenents and features of modernism. 
              They believe in the ability of modern science to attain "objective" 
              knowledge, and consequently they are inclined to accept scientific 
              accounts of the origin and history of the world and its creatures. 
              They also tend to accede to the conclusions of modern critical-historical 
              investigations into religious foundations and sacred texts, and 
              the consequent view of religion itself as a subjective human cultural 
              product. This goes along with a general acceptance of the relativity 
              of cultures, life-styles and world-views, of values and systems 
              of values, and sometimes even of truth itself. 
            <p>The result of all this, of course, in the West has often been a 
              loss of the sense of meaning, value and purpose to life-nihilism, 
              in one form or another. As my own story shows, this modern nihilism 
              is an adjoining apartment to the unqualified monism of Shankaracarya.<a href="#3">3</a> 
              Both the modern nihilist and the traditional Advaitin reduce the 
              creation to an illusion but the latter at least ;aims to transcend 
              it by renouncing it, while the modern nihilist wants to go on exploiting 
              and enjoying it. 
            <p>It is no wonder then that "modern man" in search of transcendence 
              has turned to the impersonalistic systems of the East, especially 
              when retooled by thinkers like Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan. There 
              are, however, indigenous systems that would serve nearly as well, 
              for the spiritual platform that gives expression to these systems 
              forms a part of generic human experience, one that appears at a 
              certain critical stage of spiritual development, when colossal world-weariness, 
              disgust and material exhaustion may precipitate a crisis.<a href="#4">4</a> 
            <p>Those who have adopted traditional Advaita Vedänta to modern sorts 
              of relativism have introduced a change that we should note carefully. 
              In the traditional Vedanta the world was illusory and all discursive 
              thought conditioned by limiting adjuncts, yet there was, so to speak, 
              an established system of illusion. Shankaracarya based everything, 
              after all, upon the authority of the Vedic texts. Even if, as the 
              fruit of his own dialectic, those texts themselves should end up 
              being seen as illusory, in the meantime and for all practical purposes 
              their authority establishes, as it were, an objective illusion, 
              a regular world-order. 
            <p>The thinkers who have "deepened" Shankaracarya's relativism have 
              done away with an established illusion. No specific revelation carries 
              universal authority, even provisionally. As I once heard a college 
              girl say, expressing the popular rendition of this "deepening": 
              "If you believe it's true, its true for you." Thus the modern, deracinated 
              individual becomes the author of reality, of creation. He is now 
              set free to believe in everything whatsoever precisely because he 
              believes in nothing at all. 
            <p>As a Gaudiya Vaishnava, I believe in the definite and distinctive 
              revelation of the Personality of Godhead, who most fully and openly 
              disclosed Himself when He made known His eternal form in Vrindavan 
              as Krishna, in which He conducts His most intimate and sweet pastimes 
              of spiritual love with His devotees. The self-same Krishna also 
              manifests other aspects of His unlimited divine features in descents 
              such as Rama, Narasimha, Vamana. I do not believe that various other 
              sort of powerful beings such as the <i>devas</i> (demigods like 
              Brahma, Shiva, Indra, Candra and so on) are equal to or independent 
              of Krishna; they are creatures, His servants as much as we are. 
            <p>Neither do I believe that no matter whom or what you worship, the 
              destination will be the same-for Krishna says in Bhagavad-gita 9.25, 
              "Those who worship the <i>devas</i> go to the <i>devas</i>; those 
              who worship the ancestors (<i>pitris </i>) go to the ancestors. 
              The worshipers of ghosts and spirits (<i>bhutas</i>) attain those 
              beings. But those who worship Me come to Me."<a href="#5">5</a> 
            <p>At the same time, I am able to recognise that God does His own 
              work among many nations. Commenting on the same Bhagavad-gita verse 
              that Prof. Acharuparambil quotes (4.7), Shrila Prabhupada writes: 
            <ul>
              <p> It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. 
                He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever 
                He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks 
                as much about religion as can be understood by the particular 
                people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is 
                the same-to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to 
                the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, 
                and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form 
                of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form. 
            </ul>
            <p>In my personal case, I was able to acknowledge the divinity and 
              authority of Jesus Christ, not because I accepted indiscriminately 
              the divinity and authority of anyone with claims or pretensions 
              to them. On the contrary, from Vaishnava teachings, I learned the 
              general principles which enabled me to discriminate among all purported 
              manifestations of divinity, recognising some as genuine, some as 
              not-and among the genuine, recognising differences in degrees and 
              kinds. Applying such principles, I could recognise in Jesus the 
              unmistakable signs of a pure Vaishnava. And I believe I can tell 
              the difference between Simon Peter and Simon Magus. 
            <p>It should be clear, by the way, that I do not regard the term "Vaishnava" 
              as a material designation, a sectarian name, but rather the intrinsic 
              characteristic, the inherent or constitutional quality, of every 
              soul as such: namely, a servant of God. I recognise that the true-the 
              spiritual-community of Vaishnavas may exclude many who profess membership 
              to that community visible on earth and include many ostensibly outside 
              it. 
            <p>As a Gaudiya Vaishnava, my own attitude toward "other religions" 
              perhaps resembles that of a Christian personalist like Prof. Acharuparambil 
              more than it does that of the Hindu impersonalist. I believe in 
              a revelation of God in Krishna that is definite, unique and most 
              complete; but I believe that in principle the same revelation in 
              varying degrees of completeness and clarity has been communicated 
              by God in other times and places. 
            <p>As a Roman Catholic, Prof. Acharuparambil acknowledges the working 
              of "the Spirit who blows wherever He wills", and acknowledges in 
              the other the possibility of "the seed of the Word, a ray of the 
              Truth". Now, he may think that I am enlightened by a mere ray while 
              he is enlighten by the sun entire, and I may presuppose it is more 
              or less the other way around, but at least we have a starting point 
              for discussion, providing both of us are generously disposed and 
              open to whatever we may discover-or rather what the Spirit illuminates-through 
              our association together. 
            <p>Like Prof. Acharuparambil, I belong to a community charged with 
              a mission and, like him, I feel an obligation to bring the benefits 
              of what I have received to others. At the same time, I-like Prof. 
              Acharuparambil-can recognise and respect "the prodigiousness and 
              variety of God's work in human history". Working within our respective 
              traditions, each of us feels the need to discover and perfect a 
              style of witness in which the seemingly conflicting imperatives 
              of dialogue and mission are reconciled in a creative and fruitful 
              dynamic that enriches and enlivens both. Given that we are working 
              on practically the same problem, working together would promise 
              to be a productive-and perhaps even a necessary step-toward success. 
            <p>It may not be too bold to suggest that we might also find our way 
              together to a platform on which we can join in a common mission. 
              I believe Prof. Acharuparambil and I might find ourselves occupying 
              a middle-ground between two exceedingly dangerous extremes-a middle 
              ground much in need of enlargement and strengthening. Both of the 
              dangerous extremes have been generated by the reaction of traditional 
              religions and cultures to the assault of modernity. The Irish poet 
              W.B. Yeats described the two extremes succinctly in his poem "The 
              Second Coming": "The best lack all conviction, while the worst are 
              full of passionate intensity." 
            <p>On the one side, many who are educated, liberal, and broadminded 
              profess sympathy and appreciation for a wide variety of religions 
              and cultures, but they can do so because they lack convictions of 
              their own. Therefore, when fragmentation, misunderstanding and conflict 
              increase, they tend to have no tangible vision to articulate and 
              are impotent to act effectively. On the other side, those who correctly 
              perceive the immense threat of modernity and yet lack the spiritual 
              and intellectual resources to confront it, retreat in fear and denial 
              to take shelter in one of the various sorts of fundamentalisms now 
              prospering all over the world. The fundamentalist can only secure 
              his all-too-insecure faith by bringing about the destruction-often 
              physical-of the other. 
            <p>Finding a way between these extremes, between the centripetal forces 
              of nihilism and fanaticism, has become an increasingly urgent need. 
              Such a middle way would unite genuine commitment and openness, harmonising 
              the imperatives of mission and dialogue. By its very nature, the 
              effort of forging that middle way must be conducted across conventional 
              divisions of faith-communities. My hope is that by providing another 
              look into some of the things denoted by "Hinduism", I will be of 
              some service to Prof. Acharuparambil in this effort.
