            <p align=left>NB. The footnotes for this article are linked to a separate 
              <a href="4_2tkgfoot.html">footnote</a> page. 
            <p>The Vaishnava understanding of the soul's destiny may be conveyed 
              by focusing the discussion on three topics: consciousness, salvation 
              and the kingdom of God, of which salvation is perhaps the more inclusive 
              term. To locate and frame this discussion in categories appropriate 
              to Gaudiya Vaishnavism,<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#1"> 1</a> we may 
              label these three topics with the Sanskritic terms <i>sambandha, 
              abhidheya</i>, and <i>prayojana</i>.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#2">2</a> 
              <i>Sambandha</i> refers to the conditioned soul's relationship with 
              God. (Here, our analysis of consciousness post-mortem is meant to 
              identify the soul as the one who survives death); <i>abhidheya</i> 
              refers to the regulated activities of the conditioned soul for reviving 
              its relationship with God; and <i>prayojana</i> indicates the ultimate 
              goal of life for conditioned souls. These definitions suggest, at 
              least for the present discussion, the following loose epistemological 
              equation: <i>sambandha,abhidheya </i> and <i>prayojana</i> = consciousness, 
              salvation and the kingdom of God. 
            <p><b><i>Sambandha</i>-Consciousness <i>post mortem<br>
              </i></b><i>Aham brahmasmi</i>, the <i>Upanisads</i> declare, "I 
              am not this body; I am spirit." We are each infinitesimal parts 
              of the Godhead, one in quality with Him, while quantitatively different. 
              The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (2.24) informs us that the individual soul 
              is "unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. 
              He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally 
              the same".<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#3">3</a> Consciousness is an 
              inseparable aspect of the soul which pervades the entire body, much 
              as sunlight illuminates the universe.<a
 href="4_2tkgfoot.html#4">4</a> As light is a symptom of the sun, so is consciousness 
              a symptom of the soul. Consciousness is not a result of matter interacting 
              nor can it be equated with the mind, intelligence or ego which together 
              form our psychic body. 
            <p>The body / soul distinction is immediately understood by the statement: 
              "my body". By this assertion we distinguish our true person from 
              our physical being. We do not say, "I body". Similarly, "I mind" 
              and "I intelligence" are equally incorrect. Therefore, personal 
              identity is not jeopardised when memories, thoughts and other products 
              of the mind are altered, or even lost. Personhood remains even in 
              the state of susupti, deep sleep, in which there is no psychic activity. 
              Our mental conditions may be useful in ascribing personal identity, 
              but do not in and of themselves constitute personal identity. The 
              soul is the true self, the subject of self-awareness, and the ultimate 
              agent of thinking and feeling. This agent is free and responsible, 
              unlike matter which can make no moral choices but only follow deterministic 
              patterns. Consequently, death is merely a termination of the physical 
              state-an end to the neural firings, but not the end of our spiritual 
              being. 
            <p>The Vaishnavas maintain that this spiritual being is distinctly 
              individual-not only in the state of bondage, but after liberation 
              as well. This view differs markedly from the monistic Vedantists 
              who contend that at liberation the individual self is consumed by 
              the One Supreme Self. <i>Atman</i> becomes one with Brahman, like 
              a drop of water merging with the ocean, and there the story ends. 
              The monists assert that the self as an individual should not survive 
              death, for that very desire is the root of all problems. The Vaishnavas 
              find this conclusion abhorrent, since denying permanent individuality 
              to the soul strips it of personality and deprives it of ever achieving 
              the ultimate bliss of service to God. But first one has to understand 
              transmigration. 
            <p>How has this effulgent, spiritual being called the soul become 
              fettered to this world of illusion, and forced to undergo the repetition 
              of birth and death? Gaudiya Vaishnavas believe that we were once 
              with Krishna, enjoying an eternal life full of knowledge and bliss, 
              but we abused that freedom, misjudged our strength and gave up that 
              relationship which was the very basis of our existence. Each of 
              us made a wilful decision to abandon Krishna and instantly plummeted 
              downwards. Imprisoned in material existence from a time immemorial, 
              we can neither recall our original sin nor easily find the means 
              to expurgate it. This is hell, though certainly there are regions 
              darker than this. Yet the term of our imprisonment need not be eternal. 
              Our bondage will cease when the sins that continue to stain our 
              consciousness are entirely removed. Until then, the soul must continue 
              to transmigrate. 
            <p>At death, the soul sheds the gross body, to be transported by the 
              subtle vehicle of mind, intelligence and false ego. This psychic 
              vehicle is not dependent upon the brain, and survives the body's 
              demise. The <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> (8.6) provides us this axiom: "Whatever 
              state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state 
              he will attain without fail."<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#5"><i>5</i></a> 
              The departing soul's consciousness-an accounting of all the thoughts 
              and actions of one's life-is expressed in the form of unfulfilled 
              desires which propel the soul on a psychic vehicle to its next destination. 
            <p>Under normal circumstances death plunges the soul into forgetfulness 
              of its past life, yet various Puranic examples relate previous life 
              remembrances. In the narrative of Maharaja Bharata (the famous king 
              after whom the earth is named), the monarch could still remember 
              his previous royal position despite his next birth as a deer. Such 
              instances indicate that it is the same individual who survives death. 
              And the same is true for an individual who may attain a transcendental 
              body, as illustrated by the following statement of the sage Närada, 
              quoted from Bhägavata Purana: 
            <ul>
              <p>And so, O Brahmana Vyasadeva, in due course of time I, who was 
                fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna and who therefore had no 
                attachments, being freed from all material taints, met with death, 
                as lightning and illumination occur simultaneously. Having been 
                awarded a transcendental body befitting an associate of the Personality 
                of Godhead, I quit the body made of five material elements, and 
                thus all acquired fruitive results of work [karma] stopped.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#6">6</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>The next birth-whether material or spiritual-is awarded by the 
              Supreme Lord, who as <i>Paramatma,</i> the Supersoul, is privy to 
              our most hidden desires and directs our wanderings that we may fulfil 
              them. Reincarnation is neither arbitrary, nor need it be unending 
              ;our birth is a consequence of free will. Misuse of that freedom 
              is played out in any of the universe's eight million four hundred 
              thousand species of life; while with its proper use we can return 
              back to our original home in the kingdom of God. 
            <p><b><i>Abhidheya</i>-Salvation<br>
              </b>The <i>Gita </i><a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#7">7</a> instructs 
              us to learn the truth by approaching a guru. And the Gautamiya Tantra 
              confirms, "My spiritual master opened my eyes, which were blinded 
              by the darkness of ignorance, with the torchlight of knowledge."<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#8">8</a> 
              The guru's words and example are truth, and the guru is therefore 
              considered to be the supreme personality of servitor Godhead. He 
              intercedes on the conditioned soul's behalf, seeking the soul's 
              reprieve from endless rotation on the wheel of saàsära (the repetition 
              of birth and death). 
            <p>What precisely is that intercessionary act which reverses the soul's 
              downward spiral from the Godhead? Shri Chaitanya, teaching His disciple 
              Rupa Goswami, likened it to planting the seed of the creeper plant 
              of devotion (<i>bhakti-lata-bija</i>) in the disciple's heart.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#9">9</a> 
              By doing so, the guru does not introduce something new, or even 
              something unknown. Devotion to God is part of the soul's constitution, 
              but was covered in the forgetfulness of uncountable rebirths. The 
              association of a guru promotes faith (<i>shraddha</i>), which revives 
              the disciple's dormant devotion. Faith, therefore, is the seed of 
              the devotional creeper which in maturity blossoms as <i>prema</i> 
              (love for God). Faith and guru (the bestower of faith) are essential 
              for the healthy growth of the bhakti-lata. 
            <p>After a period of mutual testing the relationship between guru 
              and disciple is formalised by initiation (<i>diksha</i>). This is 
              an essential rite of passage, for by accepting a disciple, a guru 
              is said to absorb his karma. It is not merely the stored merit of 
              the particular guru that neutralises the initiate's sins; rather, 
              it is the guru's connection with God through an unbroken chain of 
              spiritual masters (<i>parampara</i>) that allows the sinful reactions 
              to be vanquished by the Godhead Himself. The salvific relief a disciple 
              experiences by this act of mercy cannot be underestimated; nevertheless, 
              it is only the beginning of the benefits initiation is meant to 
              bequeath. If salvation is understood in the restricted sense of 
              release from karma, it is subservient to devotion. A guru's primary 
              duty beyond neutralising karma, is to offer a disciple training 
              in the devotional arts as a preparation for eternal spiritual life. 
              Devotional service then becomes the inclusive term to describe all 
              one's spiritual activities-before liberation and after. A devotee 
              hesitates to ask God even for salvation (if salvation means simply 
              release from birth and death), for that too is a selfish desire. 
              A devotee is prepared to do anything in any number of births to 
              please Krishna, so salvation as an unconditional appeal to be engaged 
              in God's service is alone acceptable. 
            <p>Following rules and regulations (<i>vaidhi sadhana bhakti</i>) 
              under the three-fold authority of guru, sadhu (saintly practitioners) 
              and <i>shastra</i> (scripture), a devotee performs mandatory devotional 
              service until the practice becomes spontaneous (<i>raganuga bhakti</i>). 
              Revelation can take place at either stage of practice, for both 
              bring one into direct contact with the Godhead in His various manifestations: 
              His names, His message, His worshipful form in the temple and foods 
              which have been offered to Him and are to be consumed as a sacrament 
              (<i>prasadam</i>). Of all practices, chanting God's holy names is 
              considered the <i>yuga-dharma</i>,<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#10">10</a> 
              the most important religious act in this present age of Kali (<i>kali-yuga</i>), 
              capable of cleansing the heart of all inebriety accumulated through 
              countless births.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#11">11</a> This is not 
              to deny the efficacy of other services,<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#12">12</a> 
              but to emphasise its centrality in Lord Caitanya's mission. 
            <p> When the heart is cleansed of all unwanted desires (<i>anartha-nivritti</i>), 
              then faith in God and His devotional service are firmly established 
              (<i>nishtha</i>). The devotional acts are so conceived as to exactly 
              resemble the very same performed by liberated souls in the kingdom 
              of God. When one has learned to serve spontaneously with taste (<i>ruci</i>) 
              and attachment (<i>aasakti</i>), one's relationship with Krishna 
              is automatically revealed, and one is able to emulate the mood described 
              in scripture of the eternally liberated associates of the Lord. 
              This relationship will accord with one of the primary rasas, the 
              loving moods relished in the exchange of love with the Supreme Personality 
              of Godhead. These are, in the order of increasing intimacy, passive 
              adoration (<i>shanta rasa</i>), servitorship (<i>dasya rasa</i>), 
              fraternal love (<i>sakhya rasa</i>), paternal love (<i>vatsalya 
              rasa</i>) and conjugal love (<i>madhurya rasa</i>). Keeping in mind 
              the ideal of an appropriate exemplar from the Lord's eternal entourage, 
              emotions will gradually intensify until there is an actual awakening 
              of love (<i>bhaava</i><a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#13">13</a>), and 
              its full manifestation (prema<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#14">14</a> 
              ). The fully Krishna conscious devotee, though still physically 
              residing in this world, actually lives in the kingdom of God. 
            <p><b>Prayojana-The Kingdom of God<br>
              </b>What is the kingdom of God and where is it located? The term 
              "kingdom of God" suggests a supreme Deity who presides over a spiritual 
              realm. But what exactly is the nature of that kingdom? Has it physical 
              dimensions, or is it only a metaphor for the internal landscape 
              of a devotee's consciousness? The <i>Gita</i> (8.21), provides the 
              following information: 
            <ul>
              <p>That which the Vedantists describe as unmanifest and infallible, 
                that which is known as the supreme destination, that place from 
                which, having attained it, one never returns-that is My supreme 
                abode.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#15">15</a> 
            </ul>
            <p>It is "unmanifest" (<i>avyakta</i> ) to those lacking spiritual 
              vision; "infallible" (<i>akshara</i>) or eternal in contrast to 
              the created universes; and the "supreme destination" (<i>paramam 
              gatim</i>) because one who attains it never returns. 
            <p>We may hesitate to exactly locate God's kingdom, fearing to do 
              so would suggest limitation. But the <i>Bhagavata Purana</i> reminds 
              us of our own universe's enormous size, which, along with innumerable 
              others of similar and even greater proportions, constitute but one-fourth 
              of existence. God's kingdom makes up the balance.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#16">16</a> 
              <i>Vaikuntha</i> (which literally means "without anxiety") is the 
              descriptive nomenclature used to identify the entire spiritual realm. 
              Manifested from the Lord's internal, spiritual potency (<i>antaranga-shakti</i>),<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#17">17</a> 
              the infinite Vaikuntha space is the Upanishadic Brahman, which the 
              Vaiñëavas explain as God's bodily effulgence. This undifferentiated 
              <i>brahmajyoti</i> is the destination of monists who desire to merge 
              their individuality into the existence of God. Vaishnavas, who eschew 
              such impersonal liberation, target one of the many spiritual abodes 
              on which the Lord personally resides. 
            <p>&nbsp;One of these, Goloka (which literally translates as "the 
              planet of cows"), is said to be the abode of Krishna, who is also 
              known as Gopala, the protector of cows. For those finding difficulty 
              in the very concept of locating the Godhead, consigning the most 
              opulent Supreme Being to a cowherd village seems inconceivable. 
              To be certain, it is not a village like any in our experience. Literature 
              like the Brahma-samhita inform us that Goloka's soil, trees, calves-everything-is 
              spiritually surcharged with the power to fulfil all of one's desires.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#18"> 
              18</a> There is nothing of the dirtiness, the toil and hardship 
              we normally associate with farms and animal maintenance. It is the 
              perfect setting for God's lila (a most apt Sanskrit term which describes 
              God's "play"). Here He cavorts with His intimate associates and 
              devotees, whose "play" is simply delight, free of all dross and 
              drudgery. 
            <p>The more conventional vision of God's kingdom-one of splendours, 
              palaces, thrones and other opulent paraphernalia-is, according to 
              Gaudiya Vaishnavas, found in the other planets of the Vaikuntha 
              space where Krishna's majestic expansion-the four-armed form of 
              Narayana-is worshipped. Whereas in Goloka the charming arrangement 
              makes all the participants forgetful of their subservience to the 
              Godhead, the majesty which characterises the other Vaikuntha planets 
              inspires the sort of awe and reverence normally associated with 
              the Godhead. There, all are mindful of the Godhead's greatness and 
              their own need to maintain a respectful distance. 
            <p>These spiritual worlds are beyond empirical observation, unapproachable 
              by any material means. As those travelling to other planets in our 
              solar system must adapt to different atmospheres, entrance to the 
              transcendental abodes requires a particular spiritual preparation. 
              To facilitate the practitioner, the Godhead's abode is recreated 
              within the bounds of our own planet. Appearing to be a simulated 
              world of virtual spiritual reality, these training grounds seem, 
              at first sight, to be no different from their surrounding geography. 
              Yet we are told that they are in fact replicated portions of the 
              spiritual sky. 
            <p>One of these locations is situated approximately one hundred miles 
              south of New Delhi, India. The area of Vraja in the district of 
              Mathura, which includes the pilgrimage town of Vrindavana, has many 
              cowherd villages. Life goes on there much as it has for thousands 
              of years, except for the occasional intrusion of modernity-a blaring 
              radio or a madly honking bus horn. Otherwise, the rambling ox carts 
              along the dirt roads, the sounds of butter being churned by hand 
              and songs of the cowherd people all seem to resist the influence 
              of time. Of the pilgrims who come here, some are able to submit 
              to the discipline that spiritual cultivation demands; others will 
              leave, taking with them memories they will relive again and again 
              until the day they can return. For the Vaishnava, such holy places 
              are non-different from their transcendental counterparts in the 
              spiritual sky, placed within this world like windows through which 
              to view eternal reality. Vaishnavas remember God's eternal play, 
              moulding themselves until they are also suitably qualified to participate. 
            <p>So far this is a definition of the kingdom of God in physical terms-the 
              spiritual planets of Vaikuntha and the pilgrimage-site counterparts 
              in this world. To be complete it needs to include how a devotee's 
              consciousness directly interacts with, and even impacts on, spiritual 
              reality. Specifically, this paper attempts to demonstrate the important 
              correlation between motivation and goals, and what bearing these 
              have on the Gaudiya Vaishnava cosmology. 
            <p>As indicated previously, there is a class of impersonal transcendentalists 
              whose aspiration is not meeting with God, but merging in Him. Monists 
              forsake a personal loving relationship with God in favour of absorption 
              in His brilliant aura. The effulgent spiritual sky which surrounds 
              God's kingdom is in fact made of shining spiritual particles intermixed 
              with the souls of monists whose desire for undifferentiated oneness 
              is thus fulfilled. In contrast to the devotees who desire to experience 
              the blissful cognition of the Lord's unparalleled company, monists 
              can realise only the eternal nature of the Godhead. Unable to savour 
              the full satisfaction which comes with God's personal association, 
              monists inevitably retrace their spiritual journey, returning dissatisfied 
              to resume material existence. 
            <p>What could possibly induce the monists to undertake even lifetimes 
              of austerities if the net result of their efforts is to boomerang 
              through the cosmic covering, only to return to their original point 
              of departure? They hold the mistaken impression that perfection 
              lies in annihilating individuality, while suffering is an illusion 
              caused by differentiating oneself from the rest of existence. But 
              their attempt at spiritual suicide fails due to the soul's indestructible 
              and indivisible character-to be eternal, full of knowledge and bliss-qualities 
              which only a loving relationship with God can fulfil. The monist 
              fails to recognise that in relationship with the personality of 
              Godhead there is none of the mundane inebriety characterising material 
              interactions. Monists therefore commit a fundamental error by using 
              their material experience as a basis for judging spiritual life. 
              God is unlike any person they have known, but the clash of egos 
              they have encountered previously in all of their interpersonal dealings 
              makes them think that with the annihilation of individuality their 
              problems will be solved. Arriving at this imperfect conclusion, 
              they try to deny their desire to love and be loved. 
            <p>The monistic example illustrates the powerful role fear plays in 
              spiritual envi- sioning. In most religious practices, fear of consequences 
              is a primary motivation for the adherent. Religious laws are codified 
              in lists of "do's" and "don'ts", with an elaborate description of 
              corresponding positive and negative consequences. Considering human 
              frailties, it is hard to imagine any tradition's success without 
              such strictures. Yet the very nature of "rules" implies a ruler, 
              who may employ force, which in turn invokes fear. God's omniscience, 
              omnipresence and unlimited strength indicate, among other things, 
              His unparalleled capability as a law enforcer, making the wrathful 
              God an image common to many traditions. Directly or indirectly, 
              nearly every religion invokes fear as a method of keeping believers 
              in line. It is difficult to ignore God's retributive capability, 
              especially (as is usually the case) when it is woven into the very 
              fabric of worship. If awe and reverence are the warp and woof of 
              the religious fabric, fear is the thread itself. It induces humility, 
              defines the tone of prayer and demands surrender. 
            <p>Built into the concept of awe and reverence is the feeling of subordination; 
              hence, distance. God's unparalleled attributes make Him nearly inaccessible 
              and potentially alienate the worshipper. Stressing God's mightiness 
              initially conditions our relationship with Him, establishing even 
              overtly that He is great, we are small. 
            <p>This does not exclude the possibility of love, for we see that 
              parents and children are bound by strong ties of affection specifically 
              due to their respective greatness and smallness. The dependency 
              of one upon the other defines their relationship. And it is this 
              same sense of dependency which characterises the love many devotees 
              feel for God, irrespective of their denominational affiliations. 
              The opulence of God the Father's majesty provides a protective umbrella 
              beneath which they can take shelter. 
            <p>Yet the Lord's mercy can be so overwhelming, His affectionate dealings 
              so appealing, that awe and respect are eclipsed by unbounded love. 
              Intimacy and famili- arity replace awe and reverence, as a devotee 
              becomes overwhelmed by the sweet dealings of the Lord. Devotees 
              with such capacity for love relate to God in friendship, parental 
              affection, even conjugal love. What distinguishes these devotional 
              moods from those who take shelter of God's majesty is the degree 
              of intimacy each entails. The roles are reversed: God becomes the 
              equal friend, the subordinate child, the paramour. The intimacy 
              of such relationships succeeds in bridging the distance awe and 
              reverence created. 
            <p>Anyone who attains the kingdom of God lives in a state of perfection. 
              To suggest that one devotee's perfection is better than another 
              seems to imply that the achievement of some is incomplete. Yet if 
              love of Godhead increases in proportion to the degree of intimacy, 
              it may not be incorrect to assign different grades of perfection. 
              All may be complete, just as various vessels may be filled to capacity 
              though the amount of water differs depending upon the size of each. 
            <p>This may cause some to feel an egalitarian disappointment where 
              an ideal in which all are "equal" seems compromised. As if to suggest 
              a solution to this dilemma, Rupa Goswami, the foremost of Gaudiya 
              estheticians, refers to Krishna's manifestations in Dvaraka, Mathura 
              and Vrindavana (the three divisions of His abode, Goloka) and says 
              that Krishna is respectively perfect, more perfect and most perfect 
              in each.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#19">19</a> How astonishing! God 
              is better in some situations than in others. Yet even in the least 
              of such circumstances He is "perfect". Similarly, all devotees in 
              God's kingdom are perfect; but some are more perfect than others. 
            <p>There is a fascinating parallel between God, His kingdom and the 
              devotee's perfection. The intimacy of devotion, as well as determining 
              relationships, also dictates which of His many features the Lord 
              reveals. God assumes a commanding demeanour as Narayana of Vaikuntha 
              for those whose devotion is filled with respect; for those whose 
              feelings of reverence are mixed with equal feelings of familiarity, 
              He reveals Himself as Vasudeva-Krishna to accommodate both moods; 
              and finally, for those who want extremely intimate love, He is Gopala 
              Krishna, a transcendental cowherd boy, who lives in the relaxed 
              atmosphere of a village surrounded by His closest family and friends. 
              These last circumstances are ideally chosen to evoke natural, spontaneous 
              love, by which the supreme personality of Godhead comes fully under 
              control. 
            <p>&nbsp;Krishna acknowledges that He is incapable to properly reciprocate 
              with those who love Him as intimately as these affectionate relatives 
              and friends. And even though He is the cause of these devotees' 
              super-excellent devotion, Krishna admits defeat. At the same time 
              He is fascinated by the paradox that though He is unconquerable, 
              He has been conquered with love; though He cannot be surpassed, 
              He has been surpassed by love. 
            <p>Of the few who have vanquished Him in this way, none have done 
              so as thoroughly as Shri Radha, His pleasure potency and spiritual 
              counterpart. Reflecting upon His astonishing defeat at Her hands, 
              He desired to understand the glory of Her love, the wonderful qualities 
              in Him that She alone relishes through Her love, and the happiness 
              She feels when She realises the sweetness of His love.<a href="4_2tkgfoot.html#20"> 
              20</a> Meditating upon His own spiritual counterpart, Shri Radha, 
              Krishna's bluish body became imbued with Her golden complexion and 
              transcendental emotions, transforming into the form of Chaitanya 
              Mahaprabhu. 
            <p>In His unique identity as "God the Devotee", Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
              expresses the most sublime feelings of love in separation. Though 
              He is the Godhead Himself, He "forgets" His supreme identity and 
              madly searches everywhere for His beloved Lord. "Where is Krishna? 
              Where is the Lord of my life?" He fervently appeals. Seeing their 
              Krishna so transformed, the residents of Vrindavana desire to share 
              His ecstasy. So they manifested alternative forms, suitable to participate 
              in Lord Chaitanya's pastimes. Thus Chaitanya and His devotees incarnated 
              on earth and inaugurated the religious practice most suitable for 
              this age: congregational chanting of the Lord's holy names. The 
              followers of Lord Chaitanya are known as Gaudiya Vaishnavas. They 
              worship both Chaitanya and Krishna, seeing Them as the same non-different 
              Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dedicating their lives to this two-in-one 
              Deity, they aspire to attain to Goloka Vrindavana, the topmost realm 
              of Krishna and Chaitanya.
