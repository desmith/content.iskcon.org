            <p align=left><b>Part One<br>
              </b>NB. The footnotes for this article are linked to a separate 
              <a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html">footnote</a> page. 
            <p><i>This paper by John Saliba presents a challenge to both the Catholic 
              Church and to ISKCON. Saliba explores the desire and the ability 
              of both traditions to engage in fruitful dialogue and examines the 
              various ways the Catholic Church and ISKCON could meet in dialogue. 
              While also looking at obstacles to dialogue he concludes that it 
              is appropriate and timely now for a formal dialogue to begin. He 
              holds that the current religious scene calls for an examination 
              of the relationship between the dominant churches and the minority 
              or new religions. His perspective is informed, well researched, 
              and comprehensive, and deserves to be met with a favourable response 
              from ISKCON.</i> 
            <p>For centuries the Christian West has enjoyed relative isolation 
              from the great Eastern religious traditions. Over the last few decades 
              it has become impossible to ignore them. Immigration, travel and 
              mass communication have made people aware of the irreconcilable 
              worldviews that different religions propose and of the need to develop 
              working relationships with people of different faith commitments. 
              There is a need to construct theologies which explain the presence 
              and persistence of diverse religions as well as pastoral programs 
              to deal with the misconceptions and difficulties that arise between 
              people who adhere to different religious tenets and follow conflicting 
              ethical norms and lifestyles. 
            <p>The presence of new religious movements in the West has brought 
              sharply into focus the problems of religious pluralism and inter-religious 
              relationships. Buddhists and Hindus have embarked on their own programmes 
              to disseminate their respective faiths and can no longer be seen 
              as people who must be converted to Christianity. These traditional 
              Eastern faiths and many other smaller alternative religious groups 
              have employed conventional evangelisation techniques to attract 
              Christians who are not quite committed to their traditional religious 
              upbringing. Although the new religious movements comprise only a 
              small percentage of the world population, they should not be dismissed 
              as unimportant or negligible. David Barrett estimates that about 
              140 million people belong to all these religious groups combined, 
              and that most of their adherents live in Asia - with only about 
              3.5 million in the Western world.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
              Since the proliferation of small religious groups has increased 
              over the last few decades, the establishment of good relations with 
              the new religions merits the attention of all those concerned with 
              religious conflicts. 
            <p>This essay explores the issue of how the Christian West should 
              relate to the new religious movements with reference to one specific 
              instance, namely the relationship between the Catholic Church and 
              the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).<a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> It will, first of all, focus on 
              ISKCON's Hindu background, and examine its openness and willingness 
              to engage in the kind of dialogue that is being carried out between 
              the world religions. Second, the Roman Catholic reactions to Hinduism 
              will be summarised, stressing particularly the developments that 
              have taken place since Vatican Council II. To what extent and degree 
              these reactions apply to ISKCON will be discussed. Third, one of 
              the major obstacles in the dialogue between the Catholic Church 
              and ISKCON-namely the evangelical and missionary goals of both religious 
              groups-will be examined. Finally, several possible ways in which 
              contact between the Catholic Church and ISKCON can be established 
              and maintained will be briefly outlined. It is the position of this 
              paper that, in spite of several difficulties, some form of dialogue 
              between these two religious traditions is both possible and desirable. 
            <p><b>Hindu and ISKCON Attitudes to Other Religions and to Dialogue<br>
              </b>The story of the advent of the Hare Krishna movement in the 
              West has been retold many times. Its evangelising techniques have 
              also been the subject of heated debates and accusations.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
              What is often forgotten, particularly in the public forum, is its 
              thoroughly Hindu background as a continuation of the Hindu devotion 
              towards Krishna. ISKCON must be understood in the context of the 
              Hindu religious tradition. Its mission to the West has to be seen 
              not as a great novelty, but as an extension of the nineteenth-century 
              Hindu renaissance that brought Hindu missionaries to Western shores.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
            <p> Stillson Judah has observed that the Vaishnava movement begun 
              by Caitanya (1486-1534?) is "presently represented most faithfully 
              by the Gaudiya Vaishnavas and by the International Society for Krishna 
              Consciousness."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
              The main religious text, the Bhagavad-gita, on which the Hare Krishna 
              movement bases its theology, forms part of the traditional Hindu 
              scriptures.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#6">6</a> 
            <p>Although "many Indian Brahmans do not recognise its authenticity 
              because ISKCON devotees tend to be 'foreign'"<a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a> one cannot understand ISKCON's 
              worldview without some knowledge of Hindu philosophy and theology. 
              Its attitudes to other religions and its readiness for participation 
              in the current encounter between world religions must be seen in 
              the framework of the Hindu theology of religions. 
            <p><b> Hindu Theology of Religions<br>
              </b>It has often been remarked that Hindu tolerance of other religions 
              is compatible with religious dialogue. This might well be the case, 
              but the Hindu theology of religions is rather complex and, like 
              any other theology of religions, is not immune to difficulties.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
            <p> In an interesting and provocative article, K. R. Sundararajan<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a> 
              examined the Hindu approach to religious dialogue particularly from 
              the Brahmanical tradition. He maintains that Hinduism has tended 
              to deal with internal diversity by adopting an attitude of tolerance, 
              while it coped with non-Hindu religious groups by fostering isolation 
              and indifference. He distinguishes two models of dialogue. The first, 
              "the closed-border model", implies that each individual should be 
              interested solely in the religion of one's birth and make no effort 
              to convert others. At best, this model would restrict any attempts 
              to evangelise others and maintain a relationship of intellectual 
              curiosity with other religious groups. At its worst, the model would 
              downgrade, if not deny, the validity of other religions and relegate 
              them to imperfect and/or temporary expressions of genuine religiousness. 
              The second model, "the border-crossing" one, involves a process 
              of indigenisation, and represents the spirit of both compromise 
              and accommodation. It aims at appropriating elements from other 
              religious traditions. Such a model has the disadvantage of minimising 
              or removing the distinctiveness of other religions and of reinterpreting 
              them to fit into Hindu theology. Sundararajan argues that neither 
              of the two models can by themselves provide a basis for a meaningful 
              dialogue, but can, if integrated, lay the groundwork for a such 
              a relationship. The first model stresses rootedness in one's tradition; 
              the second, openness to others and willingness to expand the dimension 
              of one's faith. That many Hindus have succeeded in combining these 
              two models is evident from their participation in dialogue with 
              the Christian Church. <a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#10"><sup>10</sup></a> 
              These two models are hardly unique to Hinduism. They may be found 
              in other religions as well as in ISKCON.<br>
              <b>ISKCON Theology of Religions</b> 
            <p>The issue of whether ISKCON is ready for dialogue was discussed 
              explicitly in the early 1980s by J. Frank Kenny who concluded that 
              this new religious movement is not tolerant of other religions.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#11"><sup>11</sup></a> 
              Kenny argued that ISKCON's theology is exclusive, and fails to recognise 
              the validity and effectiveness of other beliefs and practices unless 
              they could be fitted into ISKCON's own theology. In other words, 
              ISKCON's intentions of relating to other faiths are motivated solely 
              by the desire to convert others to Krishna Consciousness, and its 
              members do not relate to members of other faith with the openness 
              that dialogue demands. Consequently, ISKCON cannot engage in meaningful 
              dialogue. 
            <p> Almost a decade later Kenny took up the same point and asked whether 
              ISKCON is ready to abandon its exclusive views and recognise that 
              other religions can provide an encounter with the sacred.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#12"><sup>12</sup></a> 
              He reaffirms his previous conclusion that ISKCON is intolerant of 
              other religions, but notices the recent efforts by some ISKCON members 
              to adopt a much more positive approach to other religions. He mentions 
              four developments indicative of a change in ISKCON: (1) the fact 
              that ISKCON, which had previously rejected the "Hindu" label, is 
              now recognising itself as a Hindu religion; (2) the acknowledgment 
              that Christianity is a religion in its own right and not just an 
              imperfect form of Krishna consciousness; (3) the adoption of academic 
              studies to understand and interpret Krishna consciousness; and (4) 
              the recognition that the comparative method can be employed to delineate 
              similarities between Hinduism and Christianity. <a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#13"><sup>13</sup></a> 
            <p>In spite of these hopeful signs, however, Kenny rules out the possibility 
              of any official dialogue with ISKCON as an institution. He adds 
              that the prospects for dialogue are further hindered by the facts 
              that (1) it is not easy to determine who speaks for ISKCON, and 
              (2) it is doubtful whether ISKCON has any official beliefs.The same 
              issue has been discussed at some length by Steven Gelberg, a former 
              member of ISKCON, who agrees with Kenny that ISKCON has been too 
              exclusive. He writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>ISKCON's theological exclusivism has also impeded a true planting 
                of Krishna Consciousness in the West. Viewing itself as an island 
                in a sea of illusion, ISKCON has rarely sought intellectual or 
                theological common ground with its host society. Religions and 
                philosophies not rooted in the "Vedic" tradition have tended to 
                be dismissed out of hand.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#14"><sup>14</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p>But Gelberg disagrees with Kenny and thinks that the "insistent 
              and unthinking scriptural literalism with which many devotees preach 
              Krishna consciousness does little justice to the richness and subtlety 
              of Vaishnava texts and commentaries".<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#15"><sup>15</sup></a> 
              Elsewhere he points out that its founder, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, 
              consistently affirmed the legitimacy of Christianity as an authentic 
              religious path that leads devotees to God consciousness.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#16"><sup>16</sup></a> 
            <p>Gelberg also states that Prabhupada held that Christianity was 
              ontologically inferior to Krishna Consciousness and criticised Christians 
              for compromising their religious ideals with mundane things and 
              for abandoning the path laid out in the Bible, especially by their 
              eating of animal flesh. Prabhupäda's insistence on the ethical principle 
              of abstaining from killing animals for food has been the major obstacle 
              to dialogue.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#17"><sup>17</sup></a> 
              Gelberg, however, expresses hope that the Western devotees of ISKCON 
              will eventually examine their scriptures "for those theological 
              principles that would allow those [Christian] forms of spirituality 
              to exist beyond the conceptual and linguistic boundaries of their 
              own chosen tradition."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#18"><sup>18</sup></a> 
            <p> The most explicit effort to initiate a dialogue between the Hare 
              Krishna movement and the Catholic Church was initiated in the mid-1980s 
              by Gelberg [then known under his Hare Krishna name of Subhananda 
              das].<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#19"><sup>19</sup></a> Though 
              not an official statement by any means, his essay is an indication 
              that some ISKCON members have been reconsidering their relationship 
              with other religions for over a decade. 
            <p>Gelberg begins by contradicting Kenny and stating that the Hare 
              Kåñëa movement is quite open to dialogue. He is convinced of this 
              because the movement is "a significant representative of mainline 
              Hindu tradition"<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#20"><sup>20</sup></a> 
              and, therefore, could participate in the Catholic Church's dialogue 
              with the world's religions. He then examines the Catholic theology 
              of non-Christian religions, of Hinduism in general, and of the Hindu 
              devotional traditions. Next he turns to the anti-cult criticisms 
              of ISKCON and maintains that they could easily be levelled against 
              Christian monasticism. He writes: 
            <ul>
              <p>In our dominantly secular and materialistic society, it is easy 
                to forget that Christianity has had a long and rich tradition 
                of monasticism which has demanded from its practitioners high 
                levels of commitment, necessitating radical rejection of the world; 
                the weakening of ties with one's biological family; entrance into 
                a highly insular, cloistered community; renunciation of personal 
                possessions; obedience to a religious superior and to a Rule; 
                strict asceticism and self-mortification; the adoption of unusual 
                monastic dress; shaving of the head; celibacy; a change of diet; 
                a rigorous regimen of prayer and meditation; and physical labour.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#21"><sup>21</sup></a> 
            </ul>
            <p>In Gelberg's thought, then, monasticism is a form of religious 
              commitment common to the traditions of both the Catholic Church 
              and ISKCON, and could provide the foundation for mutual understanding 
              and cooperation.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#22"><sup>22</sup></a> 
              He develops both a Roman Catholic and an ISKCON rationale for dialogue. 
              For Catholics, dialogue with ISKCON, has several advantages: (1) 
              it would make significant contribution to the ongoing Catholic-Hindu 
              dialogue; (2) it would be a good starting point for the Catholic-Hindu 
              dialogue because ISKCON is theologically closer to the Church than 
              any other form of Hinduism; and (3) it would contribute to the spiritual 
              and ecclesial renewal of the Catholic Church itself.<a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#23"><sup>23</sup></a> For members of ISKCON, dialogue 
              with the Catholic Church would be beneficial for (1) it would challenge 
              Hare Krishna devotees to re-examine their attitude towards religious 
              pluralism; (2) it would be a learning process for ISKCON members 
              who must deal with similar problems which the church faced throughout 
              its history; (3) it would contribute to a constructive criticism 
              of ISKCON; and (4) it would help ISKCON to give importance to the 
              interior and contemplative aspects of the spiritual life. <a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#24"><sup>24</sup></a> 
            <p>One of the practical benefits ISKCON might attain through dialogue, 
              but somewhat downplayed by Gelberg, is that through official dialogue 
              ISKCON might gain respectability. One might also add that dialogue 
              could also enable both ex-Catholic members of ISKCON and their distraught 
              parents to deal more successfully with interfamilial frictions brought 
              about by membership in this religious movement. 
            <p>It would seem that Gelberg's position has ceased to be the viewpoint 
              of a handful of devotees and has become a movement within ISKCON 
              itself. Recent statements by some ISKCON members suggest that Prabhupada's 
              theology of religions was more ecumenical. In a recent essay examining 
              ISKCON's theology of religion, Ravindra Svarupa das argues that 
              Prabhupada's evaluation of religions was neither condemnatory nor 
              sectarian. Rather, ISKCON's founder maintained that bhakti, or devotion, 
              is the highest form of religious expression, and that it may be 
              practised within other religious traditions.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#25"><sup>25</sup></a> 
            <p> A similar position has been advanced by Ranchor das who adds that 
              Prabhupada said that "he had not come to convert Christians into 
              Hindus, but to encourage them to follow their own religion properly."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#26"><sup>26</sup></a> 
              Ranchor däsa concedes that "ISKCON has in many circles gained a 
              reputation for being a type of fundamentalist Hinduism, always on 
              the lookout for converts and self-advancement, whose members are 
              too busy putting their own point of view to hear what others have 
              to say."<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#27"><sup>27</sup></a> This, 
              he insists, is not the theology of religions espoused by ISKCON's 
              founder. Such a position, endorsed by other ISKCON members,<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#28"><sup>28</sup></a> 
              eschews the forceful evangelisation tactics and proselytisation 
              efforts that are so frequently linked with new religious movements 
              and rightly held to be incompatible with the nature of religious 
              dialogue. 
            <p>More recently, some members of ISKCON have shown interest in initiating 
              a formal dialogue with the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Inter-religious 
              Dialogue. While not all ISKCON members might be happy with this 
              turn of events, unanimity of members is hardly a requisite for a 
              productive dialogue. Many conservative Catholics object strongly 
              to, or are highly suspicious of, ecumenical exchanges between the 
              Catholic Church and other religious groups, be they Christian or 
              not. Nor are the schisms within ISKCON itself an insuperable barrier 
              to inter-religious dialogue. 
            <p>Other signs of ISKCON's readiness for dialogue are noticeable if 
              one looks at internal developments within the movement itself. While 
              in the late 1970s and 1980s the movement was beset with controversy 
              brought about by attacks from outside, and schisms and scandals 
              from within, the 1990s have seen it acquire some stability. There 
              has been a maturation within ISKCON, a maturation seen especially 
              in its members' ability to enact substantial reforms in their organisation,<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#29"><sup>29</sup></a> 
              to reflect critically and constructively on their own theology, 
              commitment, and behaviour,<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#30"><sup>30</sup></a> 
              and to listen to assessments of their practices by outsiders.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#31"><sup>31</sup></a> 
              Besides, there are indications that an ecumenical movement is emerging 
              within its ranks and that efforts to heal the differences between 
              the various internal factions are well under way. Moreover, the 
              Governing Body Commission, which appears to have assumed the role 
              of ISKCON's official organ of religious authority, is considering 
              a draft on ISKCON's relations with people of other faiths, a draft 
              which contains all the ingredients for a fruitful dialogue.<a
 href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#32"><sup>32</sup></a> One might also add that ISKCON 
              has never engaged in targeting the Catholic Church as the archenemy 
              of religion, as some Christian writers and organisations have done.<a href="4_2dialoguefoot.html#33"><sup>33</sup></a>
