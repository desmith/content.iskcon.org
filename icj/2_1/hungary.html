<p>ISKCON in Hungary has secured its legal status in a landmark development that represents the first time in Hungarian history that civil pressure has swayed a government decision.</p>The Hungarian government recently tried to declare ISKCON a destructive cult and revoke its registration as a religion in Hungary.   The following is a brief history of this case:
<p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>March 1993</i>: Although every registered religion in Hungary 
                is entitled to government funding, the Hungarian Parliament refuses 
                funding for ISKCON, the Moonies, Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church 
                of Scientology, declaring these groups to be 'destructive cults'.</li>
              <li><i>April 1993</i>: A bill is introduced into Parliament to retrospectively 
                restrict the registration of religions. The bill declares that 
                unless a religion has ten thousand members or has existed in Hungary 
                for one hundred years, it will not be recognised as bona fide. 
                The Government of Antall Jozsef supports the bill.</li>
              <li><em>April 1993: </em>ISKCON Hungary and ISKCON Communications 
                Europe (ICE) mount a public information campaign, the two major 
                messages of which are recognition of ISKCON as an ancient tradition 
                that makes a positive social contribution to the Hungarian people, 
                and establishing the ISKCON community in Hungary as being congregationally-based. </li>
              <li><i>November 1993</i>: Antall Jozef dies of heart failure.</li>
              <li><i>March 1994</i>: In their annual review, the Hungarian Parliament 
                sanctions funding for ISKCON but not any of the other groups previously 
                excluded. This decision takes ISKCON out of the 'destructive cult' 
                category. The Parliament explains that ISKCON 'Food for Life' 
                is a charitable activity and makes a positive social contribution, 
                and that ISKCON's good political and media relations influenced 
                their decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The proposed new law never made it past the proposal stage.</p>
            <strong>The successful campaign strategy </strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>Gita Govinda Dasi spread ISKCON's campaign message among contacts 
                in the political and media fields.</li>
              <li>Yudhistira Dasa and his wife Krishna Lila Dasi, contacted and 
                developed relationships with the academic and religious communities, 
                approaching church leaders and leading scholars.</li>
              <li>Meetings were arranged between influential Hungarians and His 
                Holiness Sivarama Swami, Governing Body Commission (GBC) member 
                for Hungary, including one with an official from the Prime Minister's 
                office.</li>
              <li>ICE initiated an international letter-writing campaign. Over 
                fifty eminent scholars, religious leaders and politicians wrote 
                to Antall Jozef. Friends of ISKCON in forty-two countries visited 
                their Hungarian embassies and consulates to complain about the 
                proposed new law and the destructive label given to ISKCON.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following is an excerpt from a letter sent to the Hungarian Prime Minister from Eric Fitzgibbon, MP, Member of the Australian Parliament:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>My Government does not consider the Hare Krsna movement a threat 
                but recognises the good work that they do in the community. In 
                fact, the Hare Krsnas have been the recipients of Government funding 
                grants ... they are a valuable asset in our community and I urge 
                you to reconsider Law 90-IV. The Hare Krsnas (or ISKCON) exist 
                side by side in harmony with other religions in Australia and 
                its contribution to the community is valuable and worthwhile.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Devotees collected sixty thousand signatures from the Hungarian people declaring 
              their opposition to the proposed law. They also organised a special 
              petition, for the attention of the Prime Minister, signed by Hungarian 
              academics, religious leaders, writers, musicians, opinion leaders, 
              etc.</p>
            <p><strong>What this means for ISKCON </strong></p>
            <p>This case sets a very important precedent for other Eastern European 
              and CIS governments, who have been monitoring its progress. (For 
              example, we know that the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia 
              Bulgaria, Ukraine, Belorussia, Russia, Latvia and Lithuania have 
              been watching this case in consideration of their own approach to 
              non-traditional religions in their countries). </p>
            <p>This victory, a text-book example of applying communications principles, has sent a clear message to Eastern Bloc countries that ISKCON is not a new religion but an ancient spiritual culture, that it is congregationally based (ninety-six per cent of Hungarian devotees live outside the temple), and that it makes a very positive social contribution. The Hungarian devotees are now being treated as a respectable religious group and their opinions are being sought on important contemporary topics by journalists and others.
<p>The Hungarian devotees, who just a year ago faced severe political opposition, are now trained and practised preachers. They are confident in approaching the leaders of society and have developed and sustained personal relationships with influential people on all social levels. They have also become practised in developing an appropriate preaching strategy based on time, place and circumstance.
            <p>This case also sends a message to Western countries who, on the 
              whole, have never seriously investigated ISKCON's credentials, to 
              reassess their approach to the Movement. Academics are using it 
              as an example of how ISKCON is valued and accepted in countries 
              such as Hungary. Of course, this would also imply a corresponding 
              message to ISKCON in the West who, to a large extent, has not seriously 
              tried to establish its credentials among the leaders in Society. 
              It also helps devotees everywhere to see how a potential crisis 
              can be used to ISKCON's advantage and clearly demonstrates how, 
              by international co-operation, it can affect a nation's decision-makers. 
              This aspect of the case is very important and requires further discussion 
              within ISKCON.
