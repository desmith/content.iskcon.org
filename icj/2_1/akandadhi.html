            <strong>The need for training </strong> 
            <p>Training is a key element in the activities of the Krsna consciousness 
              movement.  There is, however, little doubt that we have a long way 
              to go in perfecting our training process.  Srila Prabhupada has 
              given us a clear understanding that Krsna consciousness develops 
              in definite, gradual stages.  What we lack is a precise framework 
              for training devotees in the development of Krsna consciousness 
              on a personal level, and the acquisition of the necessary skills 
              to preach our philosophy under all  circumstances.</p>
            Recently, a high-level member of the Mormon church commented that 
            we are the envy of other religious organisations because of the enthusiasm, 
            determination and dedication of our members.  However, he couldn't 
            understand why we didn't invest in the training of our devotees? 
            <p>Training is taking place, but it doesn't cover all aspects of a 
              devotee's life. I speak, of course, from the perspective of my experience 
              in the UK. This yatra is one of the oldest in ISKCON, and has experienced 
              many problems in development and growth over the years.  We inaugurated 
              the Bhakta Programme in 1976, together with various methodical recruiting 
              techniques.  Even today, the UK yatra attracts more new devotees 
              than any other in the Western world. Congregationally,  there is 
              far greater interest than we can currently cope with, and we are 
              faced with training issues which make us desperately aware of our 
              deficiencies. 
            <p><strong>Radhadesh Communications Seminar 1992</strong>
            <p> It was with these considerations in mind that I presented some 
              ideas that I hoped to implement at Bhaktivedanta Manor, at the Radhadesh 
              Communications Seminar in June 1992. At that time, that's all I 
              had - just a few ideas; I wasn't even sure we were able to implement 
              them. But I was glad to have the opportunity to speak about an issue 
              which I considered of the utmost importance for the future of  ISKCON 
              worldwide. I could clearly see that in other organisations, good 
              training processes can make up for deficiencies in manpower, organisation 
              and resources - three things which we often cite as obstacles to 
              our performance. 
            <p>In the Radhadesh presentation, I principally focused on the training 
              we offer to temple devotees; although I made it clear that I fully 
              accept that training is also important for devotees outside the 
              temples, it was, at that time, beyond the scope of my presentaton.  
              I suggested the following objectives were both acccepted and desirable:
            <ul>
              <li>We want as many full-time devotees as possible</li>
              <li>We want our present devotees to be confident about recruiting</li>
              <li>We want intelligent, dynamic men and women to join our movement</li>
              <li>We want them to be as equipped as possible in understanding 
                all aspects of devotional service</li>
              <li>We want to capitalise on the experience and learning devotees 
                receive while serving in the temples</li>
              <li>We want ISKCON to have the benefit of the maturity, experience 
                and excellence of its older devotees in all services and in leadership</li>
              <li>We want devotees to practise Krsna consciousness throughout 
                their whole life and go back to Godhead</li>
            </ul>
            I was certain that in the UK we were not adequately achieving these 
            objectives. Lack of a comprehensive training training programme was 
            the major issue, and a very lively discussion followed this presentation. 
            <p><strong>Questions, questions, questions </strong>
            <p>The first thing that became obvious to everyone present was that 
              there are a lot of unanswered questions. The issues surrounding 
              the concept of training within ISKCON are somewhat deep and complicated, 
              and questions must be tackled and answered before developments in 
              training programmes can be achieved.  The following were identified 
              as the most crucial at this time: 
            <ol>
              <li> How far is it possible to train a person in devotional practice 
                or attitude?  Can you train someone  to be a devotee or can you 
                merely train someone to do the activities of a devotee?</li>
              <li>Can our standard devotional programme provide all the training 
                input that our devotees require in devotional practice and attitude, 
                or would they benefit from being augmented from specific classes, 
                seminars, istagoshtis etc.?</li>
              <li>We say that simply by following Krsna consciousness, the qualities 
                of a devotee will develop automatically.  Does this militate against 
                training programmes to develop devotional qualities, or is training 
                part of following Krsna consciousness?</li>
              <li>Considering that relationships with devotees are crucial for 
                satisfaction within the ashram, what guidance, training or other 
                help can we offer devotees in this regard, particularly for those 
                who may have been emotionally scarred from experiences in material 
                life?</li>
              <li>Is it correct  to assume that because we are under such pressure 
                from lack of staff and money that we can't afford the time and 
                expense required to train devotees, even in their specific services?</li>
              <li>Do we train according to the needs of ISKCON or to the needs 
                and nature of the devotee?  Does the tension between doing the 
                needful versus engagement according to propensity blind us from 
                seeing something very obvious about the way forward in training?</li>
              <li>We are a preaching movement, yet surveys in America have identified 
                the 'unfriendly' attitude of the devotees.  At times, preaching 
                efforts are less effective because of poor communication and presentation 
                skills.   Further, we have a mood of rejection of material culture 
                and association yet in many circumstances we need to be fluent 
                and aware enough to reach people, particularly in specialist areas 
                such as science, education, interfaith and so on.  How do we combine 
                the disdain of association of non-devotees with a need for compassion 
                and commitment to saving them and the association that brings 
                in a preaching context?</li>
              <li>How do we train devotees in the temple in the possibility of 
                lifelong brahmacarya while also providing a balanced attitude 
                towards other ashrams? How do we equip individuals for successful 
                transition to the grhastha ashram? <br>
                Our Society needs to develop a clear understanding of the identity 
                and responsibilities of the grhastha ashram.  Training brahmacaris 
                to understand the social role and personal responsibilities of 
                grhastha life would then be much easier. Our present training 
                and engagement of brahmacaris and householders is tainted by the 
                unique attitude that brahmacaris are our financial assets and 
                householders our liabilities.  Every other religious community 
                regards householders as their financial base and the training 
                of brahmacaris as an investment.</li>
              <li>Is it ISKCON's responsibility to offer occupational training 
                for those entering household life? Would it help such devotees 
                to gain such training?  How does ISKCON balance encouragement 
                of continued preaching engagement with the occupational and financial 
                needs of those whom the temple once maintained but now does not?</li>
            </ol>
            Looking for the answers Although I went to Radhadesh with some ideas 
            which I hoped might be employed at Bhaktivedanta Manor, I was anxious 
            that it may well be beyond us. I was also unsure as to what the attitudes 
            of the devotees present would be to what I had to present to them, 
            and was subsequently very grateful to them for their sympathetic hearing 
            of the ideas I presented. The enthusiasm and commitment to the principle 
            of training expressed by these devotees led to the establishment of 
            a European Working Party on Vaishnava Education and Training. Devotees 
            with experience and expertise in the fields of recruitment, training 
            and management were drawn into the party from different parts of  
            the Continent. The purpose was to formulate practical programmes for 
            training devotees.  It was my great privilege to be invited to chair 
            this Working Party. Needless to say, I returned from Radhadesh full 
            of great hope and optimism for the work ahead. 
            <p>The work begins &nbsp; The following devotees have contributed 
              to the Working Party so far: <br>
              H. H. Bhaktivaibhava Swami - Germany<br>
              H. H. Sacinandana Swami - Germany            <br>
              H. G. Jnana Dasa -  UK<br>
              H. G. Purnacandra Dasa -  UK<br>
              H. G. Rasamandala Dasa -  UK                   <br>
              H. G. Bhagavat Asraya Dasa -  UK               <br>
              H. G. Ajita Dasa - Sweden                                  <br>
              H. G. Navadvipa Dasa - Croatia<br>
              H. G. Guruttama Dasa - Latvia<br>
              H. G. Saunaka Rsi Dasa - Head of ISKCON Communications in Europe 
            <p>The Working Party have met in plenary sessions for three full weeks 
              over the last year.  Great excitement has been generated within 
              the group, there having been an ongoing consensus on all aspects 
              of training discussed. 
            <p>The Working Party has no mandate from ISKCON authorities or any 
              kind of official role.  It is simply a team of individuals anxious 
              to prepare proposals that ISKCON temples might like to take advantage 
              of. Nothing is cast in stone and indeed, the structure of the training 
              programmes and the details of courses are arranged in such a way 
              as to allow complete flexibility for local circunstances. 
            <p><strong>Overview of the Working Party discussions </strong>
            <p><i>1. Introductory Courses</i> 
            <p>It is proposed that there should be a solid induction programme 
              starting before devotees join the temples: 
            <p>a) Preliminary Course. A ten topic course in the basic principles 
              needed for a preliminary understanding of  the process of Krsna 
              consciousness and the structure and purpose of ISKCON.  It is envisaged 
              that this course could be undertaken on a part-time basis over a 
              period of one month by individuals living outside who are interested 
              in joining a temple for formal training. 
            <p>b) Foundation Course.  A one year course, divided into semesters, 
              and consisting of five modules. The first three months will be an 
              enhanced version of the current Introductory or Bhakta Programme. 
              The modules proposed are: 
            <p>ISKCON <br>
              Philosophy<br>
              Religion and Culture   <br>
              Devotional Practice<br>
              Initiation 
            <p>It is envisaged that this course will be full-time, where students 
              will be carefully prepared for life within the ashram.  During this 
              period, on a part-time basis, they will experience a range of activities 
              such as book distribution, temple service and so on.  At the end 
              of the year they will have a good understanding of all the aspects 
              of the Movement. 
            <p><i>2. Personalised Monitoring</i> 
            <p>In addition to course tutors, it is proposed that in the first 
              year of training,each student should be under the care of a monitor. 
              The monitor's primary function will be to make sure that the students 
              are enrolled in the courses appropriate for them. Each new devotee 
              should be assigned a senior male or female devotee to watch over 
              them during this first year.
            <i>3. Ongoing Training and Education</i> 
            <p>From the beginning of the second year the training will become 
              more specialised in terms of service, but asrama training and development 
              of devotional practices will continue.  
            <p>a) In-service training:  Many companies operate a 'sit by Nellie' 
              process, where trainees are assigned to an experienced employee 
              in the hope that by simply by watching this person in action the 
              trainee will acquire the necessary skills to do the same job. In 
              ISKCON, we have a more primitive system called 'sit where Nellie 
              used to be' or 'sit where Nellie would sit', and do the job. 
            <p>Enhanced training procedures in various services will put a lot 
              of pressure on our existing department heads but the full weight 
              won't lie with them because they would engage others, from inside 
              or outside of their departments, to take part in the training programmes 
              as far as possible.  Further, we conceive that a number of our smaller 
              centres that wouldn't be able to offer training across the board 
              might become 'centres of excellence' for specific aspects such as 
              book distribution, Food for Life, cooking, etc.  
            <p>b) Sastra.  Study for the Bhakti Sastri Diploma will begin here. 
              Rasamandala Dasa of ISKCON Educational Services in the UK is in 
              collaboration with Bhurijana Dasa from the VIHE to formulate a Bhakti 
              Sastri Course. 
            <p>c) Vocational training.  Many service engagements involve skills 
              which are transferable outside of the movement, e.g. cooking, computing, 
              sales, gardening, accounts, etc. A number of UK devotees trained 
              for their current outside career within the brahmacari ashram and 
              doing service within ISKCON. Indeed, they continue to serve ISKCON 
              on a voluntary basis because of that training. 
            <p>We envisage offering training for two types of careers, one within 
              ISKCON, the other for occupational services outside the Movement. 
              There are basically three career paths devotees can follow within 
              ISKCON itself, for which the following courses are proposed: 
            <p>(i) Minister.  I personally feel very excited about this course, 
              as it systematically trains devotees who have strong inclinations 
              towards preaching and pastoral activities (including book distribution, 
              nama hatta preaching, managing temples, etc). This course should 
              enable devotees to preach to any audience under any circumstance, 
              to minister to congregation and devotees and be fully equipped in 
              the philosophy of Krsna consciousness and its application in all 
              issues and to all complementary and conflicting ideologies. 
            <p>We envisage that the course will involve no more than two study 
              days a month, perhaps as a series of seminars. There will also be 
              a high expectancy of involvement in a range of preaching activities. 
              Sastra study for the Bhaktivaibhava, Bhaktivedanta and Bhaktisarvabhauma 
              diplomas will begin during this stage of training. 
            <p>(ii)  Pujari or priest. This course will be in two parts.  The 
              first part would bring someone to the standard of a good pujari, 
              capable of handling all aspects of deity worship within the temple. 
              The second part will train individuals to become ISKCON priests, 
              able to conduct ceremonies such as samskaras, festivals and yajnas. 
            <p>(iii) ISKCON management.  This course will also be in two parts, 
              the first training individuals to be proficient department heads 
              within a temple, the second covering the necessary skills to become 
              a temple president. 
            <p>There are no firm plans as yet for training in careers external 
              to ISKCON, but it is envisaged we will offer skills training which 
              is both useful to ISKCON and transferable to outside employment, 
              perhaps augmented by courses at outside institutes. 
            <p><i>4.  Workbooks </i> 
            <p>As far as possible, all courses will be in the form of workbooks 
              divided into a series of modules. The students will complete these 
              through participation in various classes and seminars under the 
              guidance of a course tutor. It will be extremely difficult to set 
              up a chronologically consistent course and structure, but the workbook 
              system will allow provision of classes on a more flexible basis.  
              The course tutor would be responsible for providing all the modules 
              within a given time limit rather than being tied down to a specific 
              schedule of classes. There will be no need for examinations or competition 
              between students because each person will complete the workbook 
              in his or her own time. It may be that devotees in one temple may 
              wish to visit another temple to acquire a particular module. Flexibility, 
              self-responsibility, and lack of competition, are the keys to this.  
              Apart from the shorter degrees, we are not looking for devotees 
              to pass an examination and achieve a certain pass grade; rather, 
              we want them to be properly aquainted with a whole range of topics. 
            <p>Training the trainers It is clear that such a complex series of 
              training programmes will require a large number of well-trained 
              tutors.  Where are we to find such devotees and how will we train 
              them?  To a large degree, I believe that the very capable devotees 
              we already have within our temples can be enabled to perform the 
              role of trainers by providing them with detailed course materials 
              and workbooks.  If we then offer them courses in training others, 
              we should be able to implement the initial stages of these programmes 
              quite adequately.  By so doing, they become more established in 
              our minds and will take root within our institution.  Over time, 
              we can apply our intelligence and resources to improving the quality 
              of teacher training. 
            <p>Separate institutes Some devotees feel that independent institutions 
              should be used to meet ISKCON's training needs. Whilst I accept 
              that there are perhaps some specific types of courses which might 
              benefit from being facilitated by an independent institute, I feel 
              strongly that temples that carry out Deity worship and a range of 
              other activities, must also be centres of learning.  If we are attracting 
              devotees, accommodating them and engaging them in service, we must 
              have training going on simultaneously.  General training for the 
              devotees should not be something they go elsewhere for.  It should 
              be the main function of the temple. 
            <p>However, the VIHE and the VTE Communication seminars have proved 
              very popular in allowing devotees to receive high level training 
              in specific topics. I would not wish to undermine such endeavours, 
              but if they are combined with good general training in the temples 
              our devotees will have the best of all worlds. 
            <p>The concept of an independent institute perhaps finds its best 
              case in training the trainers, since that is something that will 
              obviously be difficult to provide within the smaller temples. Vrindavan 
              offers this resource for teachers and preachers, but perhaps each 
              continent might have its own facility.  I would suggest it be annexed 
              to a large temple.  Such a facility would benefit from the resources 
              and programmes existing in the temple and certainly would be a reciprocal 
              asset to it. 
            <p><strong>Benefits of a training programme </strong>
            <p>1.  Devotees will become more expert in their service, confident 
              in their ashram and attentive to their  devotional practices. 
            <p>2.  Devotees will be enlivened by a sense of achievement and progress. 
            <p>3.  There is a strong possibility of attracting more highly qualified 
              devotees who are impressed with what the movement has to offer them. 
            <p>4.  Devotees will be able to make a smoother transition to the 
              grhastha ashram, having been assisted in career training, which 
              they may use either in service to the Society or as an eternal livelihood 
              to support their families.  The more productive a householder can 
              be for the Society the more likely we are to maintain or employ 
              them.  The more grateful devotees are for the training ISKCON gives 
              them, the more likely they are to support the Society even after 
              leaving the brahmacari ashram.
