            <p><strong><a name="he"></a>Hindu Ethics edited by Harold G. Coward 
              <br>
              Publisher: State University of New York Press, 1989<br>
              ISBN: 0-88706-763-8 hardback -6 paperback </strong></p>
            <p>The early Indologists were not noted for a sympathetic approach 
              to their subject.  Frequently coming from the angle of devout Christianity 
              they viewed Hinduism, whose scriptures completely contradict many 
              accounts found in the Bible, as a threat that needed to be thoroughly 
              discredited.  Sadaputa Dasa (Richard Thompson) illustrates this 
              point nicely: 'Bentley and other pioneer Indologists such as Sir 
              William Jones and Max Muller worked hard, and quite successfully, 
              to convince people that the Vedic scriptures are nothing but fables 
              and fiction.  They started a school of thought that is solidly established 
              in modern universities, both in Western countries and in India itself. 
              One of the teachings of this school is that all Vedic literature, 
              from the <i>Rg Veda</i> to the <i>Puranas</i>, is essentially a 
              fraudulent concoction written in recent times.' ('World Views: Vedic 
              vs Western',  <i>Back</i><i> to Godhead</i>, January/February 1993).<i>Hindu 
              Ethics</i> is a book that should be read against this background.  
              The authors of these three essays are not holding <i>a priori</i> 
              assumptions that Hinduism and its scriptures are simply a creation 
              of some 'impostors, cheaters and superstitious fools' which has 
              become the prevalent academic view today. They strive to maintain 
              a total academic objectivity, offering little overt value judgments 
              on the matters discussed.  However, everyone holds their own beliefs 
              and assumptions and thus objectivity may be an impossible ideal.  
              It is clear that the assumptions of these authors are somewhat at 
              variance with those held by a practising devotee of Krsna, who would, 
              of course, hold that the Vedas<i> </i>are revealed, axiomatic truths. 
              Nevertheless, the authors have thoroughly researched their subjects 
              in the Vedic literatures and the resultant essays are certainly 
              thought-provoking.  
            <p>The first essay, 'Purity in Hinduism', by Prof. Harold Coward of 
              the University of Calgary, examines Hindu attitudes towards external 
              and internal cleanliness.  Coward examines his subject thoroughly 
              from four angles: <i>suddha</i> (purity), <i>subha</i> (auspiciousness), 
              <i>sattva</i> (goodness) and <i>sauca</i> (cleanliness). Although 
              employing the standard academic dating of Vedic texts, Coward has 
              nonetheless extracted an accurate analysis of the positions they 
              espouse.  He has carefully and painstakingly put together a picture 
              of a classical Vedic lifestyle in relation to the above four concepts. 
              This is useful in showing how there is a real depth and coherent 
              philosophy underpinning classical Vedic ethics. Not that, as many 
              academics might suggest, it is all just ignorance and superstition.  
              Of course, without understanding the basic Vedic assumption that 
              life is meant for ultimate liberation rather than material gain, 
              the Vedic lifestyle will always be enigmatic as it does not easily 
              admit to academic understanding.  However, by reading Coward's essay 
              one will at least appreciate that it is a sophisticated and intelligent 
              culture with a consistent, if complex, value structure and inspire 
              further enquiry by the reader.  
            <p>The second essay on abortion, by Julius Lipner of Cambridge University 
              was, I felt, perhaps the most lucid. Again, it contains a very thorough 
              study of the classical Vedic position.  Lipner examines the attitude 
              towards abortion from all angles: social, moral and religious.  
              However, it is perhaps a little disappointing that scholars of such 
              stature as Lipner should make free use of the term 'Hindu' in referring 
              to the attitudes of a society that substantially pre-dates the introduction 
              of this term. Lipner's approach unnecessarily polemicises the issue 
              and takes from the universal stance of the Vedic statements that 
              form the basis of his research.  However, this criticism could be 
              applied to all the essays, which all share the general academic 
              viewpoint that attitudes within the Vedic tradition are formed by 
              a synthesis of scriptural and social influences.  This approach 
              does not accept authority as such, and apparent contradictions in 
              the Vedic position are not reconciled. Rather, the scriptural position 
              is seen as having always been open to interpretation and expedient 
              application, rather than being divinely originated, authentic and 
              indeed, once practised. In fact, Lipner appears to almost mock when 
              scriptural statements defy logic and current experience. (For example, 
              a reference where Vyasadeva is said to have immediately flown a 
              large distance is given the jocular aside of 'superman'). However, 
              he does labour at length to establish the exact position of the 
              Vedas on the sensitive and controversial issue of the rights of 
              the unborn.  As he himself comments: 'I venture to say that the 
              topic of this essay has rarely, if ever, had the benefit of the 
              study brought to bear here.'  From that point of view, it is certainly 
              worth reading.</p>
            The final essay by Katherine Young of McGill University, deals with 
            the issue of euthanasia, or self willed death - <i>istamrtyu</i>.  
            Yet again, her careful analysis of the Vedic scriptural position struggles 
            to piece together the complete picture of Vedic morality and its underlying 
            philosophical basis, and makes it difficult to reconcile the Vedic 
            juncture that human life has a higher purpose with modern attitudes 
            towards euthanasia.  Indeed some forms of voluntary death are quite 
            consistent with Vedic morality; for example, a ksatriya's death in 
            battle or the forest-bound ascetic's <i>praya </i>vow (starvation).  
            Of course, even these forms of dying must be considered in relation 
            to time and place and may not be appropriate in the modern context.  
            But at any time, suicide that is not sanctioned by scripture is sinful.  
            Voluntary death in order to relieve suffering has no place in Vedic 
            morality, where the knowledge of karma and the next life exists.  
            Ms Young does make this distinction clear, although her attempts to 
            define the Vedic position are strictly relativised.  For example, 
            with reference to the <i>Mahabharata</i> she says the following: 'It 
            is as if a brahmin author were attempting to ... woo ksatriyas back 
            from Buddhism.' She makes an interesting examination of the problem 
            of how any form of religiously acceptable suicide is open to abuse; 
            for example, the sati rite (<i>saha marana</i>), the suicide of a 
            widow on her husband's pyre, which has been seriously abused in modern 
            India and is now outlawed. The analysis of this phenomenon is useful 
            and needs to be carefully considered by those who would advocate a 
            return to the old standards of Vedic morality. 
            <p>Overall I found the book interesting, especially the many quotes 
              notusually encountered in ISKCON publications, and also the analysisof 
              how the interpretation of the Vedas has been possibly influencedby 
              different social phenomena over the years. I would recommend itto 
              anyone concerned with modern attitudes towards the Vedic tradition.

            <p><strong><a name="ct"></a>Christian Theology and Inter-Religious 
              Dialogue Author: Maurice Wiles<br>
              Publisher: SCM Press, 1992<br>
              ISBN: 0-334-02523-0 </strong> 
            <p>Some thirty years ago, the theologian Wilfred Cantwell Smith asserted 
              that any serious intellectual statement of the Christian faith must 
              include, if it is to serve its purpose, some sort of doctrine of 
              other religions. 'We explain the fact that the Milky Way is there 
              by the doctrine of creation,' he wrote, 'but how do we explain that 
              the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> is there?' 
            <p>Thirty years later, Cantwell's question is also the concern of 
              Maurice Wiles, Regius Professor of Divinity Emeritus at Oxford University.  
              For Prof. Wiles, the close co-existence of different faith communities 
              in the modern world is as important as a background to Christian 
              theology as the rise of the mechanistic, scientific worldview. 
            <p>At a time of increasing conservatism and opposition to interfaith 
              activity, Prof. Wiles' book is something of a radical departure 
              from the traditionally narrow Christocentric approach of the established 
              churches.  It is a soul-searching book, which begins by asking whether 
              acceptance of the possibility of open dialogue with other religions 
              is not a desertion of the way in which the church has understood 
              its faith through the ages.  Both Catholic and Protestant churches 
              have traditionally been somewhat averse to venturing outside their 
              own territory.  In the fifteenth century, the Council of Florence 
              affirmed that:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>No-one outside the Catholic church, not only pagans, but also 
                Jews and heretics and schismatics, can share eternal life, but 
                will perish in the eternal fire pared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            </blockquote>
            One hundred years later, Martin Luther wrote in strikingly similar 
            terms: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Those who are outside Christianity, be they heathens, Turks, 
                Jews or even false Christians and hypocrites . cannot expect either 
                love or any blessing from God, and accordingly remain in eternal 
                wrath and perdition.</p>
            </blockquote>
            Of course, these declarations are not conducive to interfaith dialogue, 
            and Prof. Wiles painstakingly disassociates himself from this stance 
            by constructing a personal theology for dialogue without compromising 
            traditional Christian theology.  He emphasises that a vital feature 
            of a Christian theology for dialogue is a revisionary approach to 
            the faith and its practices, but without surrendering the absoluteness 
            of commitment to Jesus. These, he argues, are not incompatible; loyalty 
            to one's own faith and self-criticism can co-exist.  Indeed, the former 
            implies the latter. Wiles is hopeful that a theology arising out of 
            the experience of dialogue with other religions will raise new possibilities 
            and new necessities of further revision. 
            <p>However, <i>Christian Theology and Inter-Religious Dialogue</i> 
              is not an easy book to read.  As it reveals the mind of a Christian 
              who is genuinely concerned to construct a coherent theological position 
              of faith, and is replete with Christian terminology, it is essentially 
              a specialist publication.  Although at times difficult to follow, 
              it is nonetheless interesting, and is a helpful book for all those 
              who have an interest in interfaith dialogue.

            <p><strong><a name="ge"></a>A Global Ethic: The Declaration of the 
              Parliament of the World's Religions <br>
              edited by Hans Küng and Karl-Josef Kuschel<br>
              Publisher: SCM Press Ltd., London<br>
              ISBN: 334-02561-3 </strong> 
            <p>During the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, a declaration 
              was passed that was subscribed to by representatives from all the 
              major faiths in the world - the 'Declaration Toward a Global Ethic.' 
            <p>At just over one hundred pages, this book describes the historical 
              background of how the declaration toward a global ethic was conceived 
              and the principles it adheres to.  The understanding behind this 
              initiative is that there can be no improved world order without 
              a global ethic and that this basis for such an ethic can be found 
              in an already existing fundamental consensus concerning values, 
              standards and moral attitudes among the world's religions. 
            <p>Prof. Hans Küng, who was  largely responsible for the wording of 
              the declaration, states in the preface of this book that 
            <p>. a global ethic seeks to work out what is already common to the 
              religions of the world now despite all their differences over human 
              conduct, moral values and basic moral convictions.  In other words, 
              a global ethic does not reduce the religions to an ethical minimalism 
              but represents the minimum of what the religions of the world already 
              have in common now in the ethical sphere. 
            <p>The Global Ethic is based on four basic directives or principles, 
              namely: 
            <ol start=1 type=1>
              <li style='text-align:justify; '>Commitment to a culture of non-violence 
                and respect for life.</li>
              <li style='text-align:justify; '>Commitment to a culture of solidarity 
                and just economic order.</li>
              <li style='text-align:justify; '>Commitment to a culture of tolerance 
                and a life of truthfulness.</li>
              <li style='text-align:justify; '>Commitment to a culture of equal 
                rights and partnership between men and women.</li>
            </ol>
            According to Vedic literature, progressive human life is based in 
            the development of four basic human qualities, namely mercy, truthfulness, 
            austerity and cleanliness. The Vedic tradition is formed in such a 
            way as to promote the development of these basic human qualities and 
            in that way advance the human race.  It is interesting to see the 
            same approach being taken in the 'Declaration of a Global Ethic', 
            where the importance of people 'changing their hearts' and 'transforming 
            their consciousness' as a means of solving the world's problems is 
            stressed. 
            <p>Prof. Küng makes the point that the declaration is not an end in 
              itself, but should serve as a basis for continued discussion and 
              further progression towards gradually making individuals, organisations 
              and political establishments aware of the importance of taking personal 
              responsibility for the state of the world by developing their own 
              inner character towards nobility. 
            <p>Discussion on this theme is already underway in many countries 
              and will also be on the agenda of the next meeting of the World 
              Conference of Religion and Peace (WCRP) in Italy at the end of 1993. 
            <p>As followers of the Vaishnava tradition, ISKCON welcomes the initiative 
              of working towards a change in individual consciousness as a means 
              of solving global problems, and now have the opportunity to do so 
              in co-operation with many other spiritually-minded people. 
            <p>I strongly recommend that anyone involved with interfaith dialogue 
              read this book, whose concept could open up many opportunities for 
              such contact.
