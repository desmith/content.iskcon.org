<p><i>This paper, delivered at the Vaisnava Academy Conference, Wiesbaden, Germany, in January 1994 yea,r marks a watershed in the development of ISKCON in Germany -  a 'coming out' of ISKCON into German society. This paper was the keynote speech at the conference and represents an honest attempt to address the issues and concerns of the German people and to explain how ISKCON has started to reassess its attitudes and practices in light of these concerns. It also acts as an example of how an ISKCON community has acted to change a twenty-five year history of mutual misunderstanding and hostility to serve as a basis for dialogue and respect. </i></p>Introduction Twenty-five years ago, the first Hare Krsna temple was opened in Germany. At that time Hare Krsna in Germany meant a small group of idealists, dropouts and India fans. Now that we have grown into a multifaceted society, we have been forced to reconsider our self-perception and public image. Bridging the cultural gap, social integration and inter-religious dialogue are just some of the challenges we face.     
<p>This conference is a milestone in the development of ISKCON Germany. For the first time we are opening a public forum and we hope it can serve as a symbol for a new and better relationship between ISKCON and the German public based on mutual respect and understanding, and real co-operation.     
            <p>We have learned a lot since the early days of ISKCON, but still 
              have a long way to go. In retrospect, we need to recognise that 
              we have made grave mistakes in our treatment of the public in general 
              and families and public institutions in particular. These mistakes 
              arose primarily from youthful immaturity, deficient philosophical 
              understanding and difficulties in communication on the part of our 
              members as they sought to attain integration into a society that 
              not only considered them to be outsiders, but also treated them 
              as such.     
            <p>We regret these mistakes wholeheartedly and are sincerely endeavouring not to repeat them.  In my speech, I would like to elaborate on the role that ISKCON sees for itself today and the response it gives to certain important questions. We hope that our ideas can serve as a basis for discussion and open the door for further constructive communication.</p><b> ISKCON </b><b>Germany</b>
<p>ISKCON is a cultural movement for the re-spiritualisation of society, its goal being to contribute positively to the areas of religion, culture, social development and education.   It is part of the ancient Vaisnava tradition, and is based on the Bhakti-scriptures (especially the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, <i>Bhagavata Purana</i>,<i> </i>etc.). Vaishnavism is considered to be the most popular of all of India's religious traditions, categorised under the generic term 'Hinduism'.     
<p>ISKCON's activities in Germany are governed by a national council of fifteen members. Each ISKCON centre is headed by a temple president, a vice-president and a secretary. ISKCON's international Governing Body Commission (GBC) is represented in Germany by a secretary, who is responsible for implementing and maintaining the internationally agreed ISKCON standards of management, worship and practice.
            <p><strong>Facts and figures </strong>
            <p>There are presently eleven ISKCON centres in Germany: Berlin, Flensburg, 
              Hamburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Jandelsbrunn, Koln, Leipzig, Nuremberg, 
              Weimar and Wiesbaden.  There are a total of one hundred and fifty 
              students and priests living in these centres - eighty male, seventy 
              female.                  <p>The age distribution of these temple communities is as follows:

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Additionally there are many ISKCON members who live outside the 
              temple with their families, including temple presidents, priests 
              and other officials. There is a growing congregation of approximately 
              five thousand who partly or completely follow the principles of 
              Krsna consciousness. </p>
            <p><strong>Social Integration</strong></p>
            <p><i>ISKCON's public image</i> 
            <p>As a relatively new phenomenon, ISKCON Germany has experienced 
              many problems in its social integration. An analysis of the past 
              would show that the difficulties and, in some cases, even the hostilities 
              arose out of the social conditions of the sixties and seventies. 
              When Krsna consciousness was transplanted into the West it attracted 
              mainly young people who came from the social background of the late 
              sixties, with all its ideals and enemy stereotypes.      
            <p>A quarter of a century has passed since the establishment of ISKCON 
              in Germany, and the senior Vaisnavas can no longer be seen as members 
              of a youth sect.  It is now time for a reassessment of the present 
              social perspective towards ISKCON in Germany.      
            <p>Objective academic study is required to form the basis of this 
              reassessment, to include the historical development of the relationships 
              between ISKCON and the churches, parent groups, anti-sect organisations, 
              government agencies and the media. Without a basis in such impartial 
              research, it will be extremely difficult for any of us to change 
              the paradigms binding us today.      
            <p>An example of such an independent research unit can be found in 
              the UK, in an organisation called INFORM, which is financially supported 
              by the government, the Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church 
              and other major religious denominations. INFORM undertakes careful 
              and objective research, acts as a mediator in disputes and provides 
              counselling. It is interesting to note that since the establishment 
              of INFORM in 1988, it has received no complaints about the Hare 
              Krsna movement in the UK. 
            <p><i>The congregation  </i> 
            <p>One aspect that has undergone a fundamental change in ISKCON is 
              the relationship between temple and congregation. In the beginning, 
              'Hare Krsnas' were associated with shaved heads, saffron robes and 
              temple communities. ISKCON today can no longer be limited to this 
              image, our structural picture being very different. Congregational 
              members form a much larger percentage of the ISKCON population than 
              temple communities, comprising ninety-five percent of the total 
              membership. This clearly shows that ISKCON is now a congregationally-based 
              movement.      
            <p>The role of the temple or ashram has also changed. ISKCON centres 
              are now places for education, communication and preaching, and they 
              serve the congregation as places of worship and association. Devotees 
              who live in the temple receive a spiritual education, after which 
              most of them marry and establish a family. Over eighty percent choose 
              to live outside the temple and take up careers outside of ISKCON 
              in areas such as medicine, the arts, business, farming, education, 
              etc.  Those devotees who remain in the temple live as priests, preachers 
              and counsellors - roles for which we provide comprehensive training.     
            <p>Minors are only allowed to live in the temple community with explicit 
              written permission of their parents. Persons undergoing full-time 
              vocational or professional training are advised to complete this 
              before beginning their studies with ISKCON.  We also discourage 
              members from giving up their occupational or family obligations, 
              evidenced by the ten-fold growth in our congregation over that of 
              our temple communities in recent years. 
            <p><i>Family</i> 
            <p>The high proportion of congregational members within ISKCON today 
              has also forced us to consider more deeply our approach to family 
              life. We respect and support the institution of a spiritually oriented 
              family and recognise that it is essential for social stability and 
              harmony.      
            <p>We know that family members sometimes have difficulty with close 
              relatives joining ISKCON. There are different reasons for this: 
              lack of understanding of our culture and practices; previously existing 
              tensions within the family; immature and insensitive actions by 
              devotees, and the spreading of false information about the motives 
              and aims of ISKCON. We very much regret this situation and are happy 
              to work with government authorities, welfare institutions and other 
              religious traditions to avoid these tensions and misunderstandings.  
              We have also gone some way towards addressing this problem by arranging 
              meetings with family members of devotees. In addition, we will not 
              allow minors to become members of temple communities unless we have 
              first discussed it with their parents. Such actions may not bring 
              about a final solution for all problems, but at least they offer 
              a good preliminary contact.
            <i>ISKCON's social ideals</i> 
            <p>In Germany, we have sometimes been accused of wanting to introduce 
              the caste system to the West and that we are motivated by political 
              interest. These are misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions that 
              we must address.      
            <p>In the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, Krsna points out that there are four 
              natural social divisions (<i>varnas</i>) to be found in all societies: 
              intellectuals, administrators, businessmen and labourers. Krsna 
              stresses that individual qualities and behaviour determine which 
              social order one belongs to. In the corrupt caste system seen in 
              India today, social qualification is determined by birth. Such a 
              system is only in the interest of the higher, elitist castes, that 
              use it to maintain their own social position and thus avoid criticism 
              or competition. In other words, the present caste system is a contradiction 
              and distortion of the original <i>varnashrama</i> social system, 
              as described by Krsna.      
            <p>In the caste system, social circumstances reminiscent of the feudal 
              systems in medieval Europe are dominant. For example, only Hindu 
              priests are allowed to study Sanskrit, to read the religious scriptures 
              and to perform temple ceremonies. For the proponents of the caste 
              system it is out of the question for a non-Hindu, what to speak 
              of a non-Indian, to perform these activities.      
            <p>It was this exploitative and unjust caste system that Caitanya 
              Mahaprahbu was opposed to. Five hundred years ago this great Bengali 
              saint and reformer initiated a renaissance of the Vaisnava tradition 
              in India, and founded the Hare Krsna movement. This movement stood 
              open for people of all religions, castes and skin colours, and is 
              today continued by ISKCON all over the world.      
            <p>As ISKCON does not support the caste system, the movement is criticised 
              by the proponents of this system who do not acknowledge us as being 
              Hindu - an accusation that is sometimes quoted in the West as well.  
              However, this opinion is not shared by the majority of the Indian 
              population.      
            <p>Sri Caitanya has taught that love of Godhead is the highest goal 
              of life. This goal can only be achieved by individual development 
              of Krsna consciousness, not by political revolution. A religiously 
              oriented social system, such as <i>varnashrama</i>, may support 
              the development of such consciousness, but should never become a 
              goal in itself.       
            <p>The aim of ISKCON is not a political revolution but a spiritual 
              change of consciousness within society. Such a change of consciousness 
              could make it possible for man to live and act more in harmony with 
              his individual material and spiritual nature, which would go a long 
              way in solving many of today's social problems.     
            
            ISKCON has published several books and treatises as a basis for discussion 
            on the <i>varnashrama </i>topic. Within the Society there is a wide 
            spectrum of opinion in this regard. The international Governing Body 
            Commission (GBC), however, has not yet reached a final decision and 
            pursues no official policy in this connection. 
            <p><i>Gender roles</i> 
            <p>The founder of ISKCON, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (more 
              commonly known to devotees as Srila Prabhupada) was able to transplant 
              the old Vaisnava tradition from India to the West in an innovative 
              way without losing any of its essential religious teachings. This 
              also applies to the role of women. Srila Prabhupada gave women initiation 
              as brahminical priests, which was a revolutionary change. He emphasised 
              in his teachings and by practical example, the spiritual equality 
              of all persons irrespective of their social status, beliefs or gender.  
              He also allowed women to devote themselves on a full-time basis 
              to the pursuit of spiritual life within the same ashram community, 
              separated from the male members. This was another reformation in 
              Hinduism, as traditionally ashram communities were for men only.      
            <p>However, this innovation also created a problem: men and women 
              now had to practise a celibate life side by side. Srila Prabhupada 
              intended that both men and women share equal rights and duties, 
              although men eventually set the tone due to their greater numbers. 
              However, many more women have now joined the movement - constituting 
              almost half the devotee community  - and there is presently an active 
              internal dialogue about their role.     
            <p>As a result of this development, ISKCON Germany is taking concrete 
              steps to avoid any kind of discrimination against women, in order 
              to enhance mutual respect and support among devotees in our communities. 
              These endeavours have already borne their first fruits; for example, 
              a third of all seats in the National Council have, for some years, 
              been held by women, and three of our eleven centres have a female 
              temple president.
            
            <p><strong>Inter-religious dialogue </strong></p>
            <p>God is unlimited, both with regard to time and place. ISKCON does 
              not limit God to a single religion or holy scripture, but accepts 
              them all as revelations of the same God.  The various religions 
              are but different ways to elevate people to higher and highest levels. 
              The highest level, as the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> teaches, has nothing 
              to do with any denomination, but with consciousness itself: an internal 
              attitude of pure, loving devotion to God. We want to draw people's 
              attention to this proposal as being the common goal of all religions. 
            </p>
            <p>'Our world is going through a fundamental crisis: a crisis of world 
              economy, world ecology, world politics.' This statement is included 
              in the World Ethos Declaration of the Parliament of World Religions, 
              Chicago, September 1993. We believe that all religions, when acting 
              in a common effort and as equal partners, will play a vital and 
              decisive role when confronting today's global problems.  In a world 
              in which different ethnic, religious and social groups are violently 
              fighting one another, the religions should come together to jointly 
              work against fanaticism, conflict and moral decay. 
            <p>An understanding of the realisation and experience of others will 
              help one to avoid mistakes in one's own development. A genuine dialogue 
              (i.e. two-way communication) requires the ability to accept and 
              assimilate criticism, which is indispensable for a sound development 
              of any society or religion. 
            <p>The preliminary requirement for inter-religious dialogue is that, 
              in our opinion, each person allows the other the right to define 
              himself in his own terms and that one does not present one's own 
              religious tradition as the universal standard or try to force this 
              tradition on others.  ISKCON Germany now recognises the advantages 
              that such a dialogue offers and has established a Committee for 
              Inter-religious Affairs to help develop these opportunities. 
            <p>Another important step towards a more intensive dialogue with other 
              religions and academic circles is the Academy for Vaisnava Culture, 
              founded in Bonn, Germany in 1992, by members and friends of ISKCON. 
              The Academy's goal is to promote research into the meaning and contribution 
              of Vaisnava culture in modern society, and to support academic investigation 
              into ISKCON's role in this exchange of cultures and religions. This 
              aim will be met by publications, seminars, conferences and other 
              forms of research and communication. 
            <p>Human welfare activities Our charitable activities vary according 
              to the needs of the different countries in which we are active. 
              For instance, we undertake the distribution of the bhakti scriptures, 
              with the purpose of giving mankind spiritual knowledge that together 
              with ethical guidelines, form the foundation of a stable, harmonious 
              society whose members use the resources of this world in a responsible 
              way. 
            <p>Probably the best-known and most popular activity is our world-wide 
              free food distribution programme, 'Hare Krsna Food For Life'. Srila 
              Prabhupada once said that no one within ten miles of any of our 
              temples should go hungry. Based on this principle, he founded 'Food 
              for Life' in 1970, through which many millions of free meals have 
              been distributed over the last two decades. In many places devotees 
              liaise with local charity organisations and state authorities, thus 
              distributing thousands of meals daily all over the world. 
            <p>Recently, countries comprising the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia 
              have become the centre of extensive food programmes by ISKCON, including 
              war zones such as, Sarajevo and Sukhumi (Georgia). In the townships 
              of South Africa, over one million meals were distributed to the 
              needy last year. During natural catastrophes emergency programmes 
              are carried out; for example during the recent flood disasters in 
              Bengal and the latest earthquake in Maharashtra, India. 
            <p>In Germany, too, we have gathered experience with free food distribution 
              in recent years as a prelude to the launch of a large scale 'Food 
              for Life' project in this country. 
            <p>Conclusion ISKCON in Germany is a young institution, and as such 
              we have still a lot to learn.  We therefore need your help in this 
              developmental stage.  We want a relationship that is based on genuine 
              dialogue, not out-dated or false information, leading to open exchange 
              of opinions and information. We hope that this conference will mark 
              the beginning of a respectful , lasting and harmonious relationship.
