            <p><b>Brief details of centre</b> 
            <p>Bhaktivedanta Manor is the UK headquarters for the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness. Donated to the service of His 
              Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada by the late George 
              Harrison, Bhaktivedanta Manor has served as one of the main centres 
              for the Krishna consciousness movement since 1973.</p>
            <p> Located near Aldenham, Watford, about 20 miles North-West of London, 
              Bhaktivedanta Manor is surrounded by beautiful greenery, farmland 
              and quaint English villages.</p>
            <p> The manor has a theological college and a magnificent shrine for 
              the worship of Sri Sri Radha-Gokulananda and Sri Sri Sita-Rama. 
              Laxman and Hanuman.</p>
            <p> At Janmastami, Bhaktivedanta Manor stages the largest Hindu festival 
              outside of India, each year receiving about 50,000 pilgrims over 
              a period of two days. The event is celebrated in great pomp and 
              splendour. There are many exhibitions, books and paraphernalia stalls, 
              prasad (sanctified food), plays, and dancing. The festival is manned 
              and organised by volunteers. </p>
            <p><b>History</b></p>
            <p> In 1973, when George Harrison donated the Manor building and estate, 
              Hertsmere Borough Council allowed Bhaktivedanta Manor to operate 
              as a theological college. At that time, Srila Prabhupada established 
              a Vaisnava college, with a shrine accessible to the public.</p>
            <p>After initial complaints by some local village residents about 
              the increase in traffic, Hertsmere Council decided to take strong 
              action against the public worship. In 1981 it tried to stop worshippers 
              and pilgrims by banning all festivals. Later, however, a compromise 
              was reached to limit large festivals to six days a year. the battle 
              to keep the temple open continued for many years. Finally in 1996, 
              permission was granted and the temple was allowed to stay open.
            <p> Since then Bhaktivedanta Manor has become renowned as an important 
              place of pilgrimage. People are attracted to the worship, the farm 
              and the gardens.
