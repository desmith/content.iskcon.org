                    International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) of 
                    Houston sometimes referred to as Hare Krishna Dham was incorporated 
                    in 1972 as a non-profit organisation. In 1972 temple services 
                    were conducted with pictures in a Montrose area home. </p>
                  <p>In 1974 the temple was moved to a bigger facility on Rosalie 
                    Street and Sri Sri Nitai Chandra and Sri Sri Chaitanya Chandra's 
                    deities (big Gaura Nitai Deities) were installed. </p></td>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Mostly western devotees were participating in the temple services. 
              This temple was supported mainly by money from book distribution. 
              In 1979 Sri Sri Nitai Chandra and Sri Sri Gaura Chandra's (small 
              Gaura Nitai deities) deities were also installed. By 1980 congregation 
              members had increased and more space was required. </p>
            <p>In 1984 the current building, an old church, was purchased and 
              the temple was moved from Rosalie Street to 34th Street. Immediately 
              after that devotees started working on the temple renovation. After 
              the renovation was complete in 1986, Sri Sri Radha Nila-Madhava 
              were installed. In 1989 Sri Sri Giriraj Govardhan was installed. 
              Finally in 1992&#8211;93 Sri Sri Radha Giridhari also arrived into 
              Houston temple. </p>
            <p>Slowly members of Indian origin started taking active part in the 
              activities. To cater to the needs of Indian community and their 
              families, Gauranga Hall was built in 1996. It can host 1000 members 
              during festivals and other functions. To even better facilitate 
              the spiritual needs of the community temple management is embarking 
              on a new temple project which will give permanent abode for Sri 
              Sri Radha Nila-Madhava and other deities. </p>

              all your devotional needs, including scriptures, Deity pictures,

              Sri Sri Radha Nila-madhava's Sunday School is designed primarily 
              to insure that the children of today have an opportunity to grow 
              up knowing the rich and glorious spiritual heritage of India. The 
              school was started by Indian-American immigrants who, while materially 
              prospering, felt they had not sufficiently grounded their children 
              in this spiritual discipline. </p>
            <p>Classes for children ages 3&#8211;14 are held each Sunday from 
              5:45 pm to 6:45 pm. These will be carried out in six sessions per 
              year, each lasting two months. Each session includes an activity 
              class (like Vaisnava art, dance, or mridanga-drum lessons) and a 
              philosophy class (learning from the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>and other 
              Vedic scriptures). For more information, contact Manjumati Devi
