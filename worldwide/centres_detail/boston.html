            <p><b>Interfaith<br>
              </b>Since the United States eased immigration laws in the 1960s, 
              a new wave of immigrants from Asia and Latin America has helped 
              to transform the religious landscape of our country. Established 
              religious institutions have adapted to a growing diversity of believers, 
              and traditions once little known in the United States have established 
              centres in cities from coast to coast. </p>
            <p>The Boston metropolitan area is home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, 
              Jains, Buddhists. Muslims, Baha'is, Pagans, Taoists, Zoroastrians 
              and Native Americans. Members of the area's clergy are trying to 
              understand their new neighbors and keep a finger on the pulse of 
              this new racial, ethnic and cultural reality. The Interfaith movement 
              builds community across traditional boundaries through group meetings, 
              multi-faith services, doctrinal or issue-oriented dialogue, and 
              co-ordinated social action. </p>
            <p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura, a 19th century Vaisnava saint observed that 
              interfaith involvement strengthens one's faith in one's own tradition 
              while helping develop a greater sense of respect for the sanctity 
              of other faiths. He said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2">When we have occasion to be present at the place 
                of worship of other religionists at the time of their worship, 
                we should stay there in a respectful mood, contemplating thus: 
                'Here is being worshiped my adorable highest entity God, in a 
                different form than that of mine. Due to a different practice 
                of a different kind, I cannot thoroughly comprehend this system 
                of theirs. But seeing it, I am feeling a greater attachment for 
                my own system. God is one. I bow down before His emblem as I see 
                here and offer my prayer to my Lord was adopted this different 
                emblem so that He may increase my love toward Him in the form 
                that is acceptable for me.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In this spirit, ISKCON of New England currently participates in 
              two groups: The Boston Clergy and Religious Leaders Group for Interfaith 
              Dialogue and The Massachusetts Bay Chapter of the Religion Communications 
              Council.</p>
            <p> ISKCON has also started a Catholic-Vaishnava Interfaith Dialogue 
              in conjunction with local parishes. In the future, we hope to host 
              web pages for local interfaith groups from this site. </p>
