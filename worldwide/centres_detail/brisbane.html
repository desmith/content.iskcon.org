            <p><b>Food for Life<br>
              </b>At Brunswick St in Fortitude Valley, Hare Krishna Food for Life 
              or "Krishna's Cafe" provides very low cost meals of Krishna <em>prasada</em>. 
              For many who eat there, it is a welcome relief in their state of 
              financial shortage. Others, who have no apparent poverty, eat there 
              just because the food is so good. One "down and out" looking youth 
              was overheard commenting that the yuppies seem to think it is cool 
              to be seen eating at Food for Life. Food for Life has enhanced public 
              respect for Hare Krishna devotees in Brisbane. City managers and 
              others have often praised the devotees for this selfless work. On 
              the 23th of November 1996, devotees celebrated Feed the World Day, 
              making a giant Krishna cake and distributing it in the Fortitude 
              Valley Mall. City Council Alderman David Hinchcliffe helped cut 
              the cake and presented a speech extolling the valuable service Hare 
              Krishna Food for Life offers. </p>
            <p><b>Rathayatra Festival</b> <br>
              The Brisbane City Council so much wanted Lord Jagannatha's Chariot 
              to be in their annual parade that they paid for the transport of 
              the huge wooden chariot from Murwillumbah, NSW, and for the flowers 
              to decorate it. Although Brisbane is sunny almost every day in winter, 
              on the night of the parade in early spring there was a downpour. 
              Not to worry, the City Council had weather insurance, and a week 
              later the parade was on. As devotees towed the large, yellow and 
              red chariot by ropes through the city streets, the crowds cheered 
              and clapped, shouting greetings. The devotees chanted Hare Krishna 
              exuberantly, waving to the crowds; and the transcendental "float" 
              rolled by, with its glowing red and yellow cloth dome, illumined 
              from within, appearing as a beacon in the night sky. </p>

            <p> Right across the street from the Myers complex in downtown Brisbane, 
              Govinda's offers relief from the junk food of the material world. 
              With delicious vegie preps, hot rice, pakoras, papadams, samosas, 
              salad, hot halava and thirst quenching drinks, Govinda's has to 
              be the value for money eating spot in town. Hundreds daily patronise 
              Govinda's, where dedicated devotee cooks carefully prepare vegetarian 
              Krishna <em>prasada</em> (Krishna's mercy) daily. </p>
            <p><b>Glory of India Project</b> <br>
              Local devotees are developing an exciting new project which will 
              form the base for Krishna consciousness in the area for many years 
              to come. On 12.5 acres at Jindalee, which is not far from central 
              Brisbane, they plan to build a temple community over the next five 
              years or so. The plan, to be executed in stages, includes a Temple 
              and Worship Hall/Auditorium, a community hall and restaurant, a 
              school, accommodation, recreation grounds and parking. The Temple 
              will be approximately 425 square metres ground floor area. </p>
            <p>The worship hall/auditorium will be on the ground level and the 
              temple itself on the second floor level. The worship hall will be 
              625 square meters. The community hall will include a communal eating 
              area and will be 800 square meters. On the ground floor of this 
              building will be the school for approximately 80 to 100 children 
              of primary school age (6&#8211;12 years). This will include a standard 
              educational curriculum enhanced by religious studies. </p>
            <p>Adjacent to the community building will be a recreation area for 
              the school and visitors to the centre. Accomodation for single devotees 
              will include four community dwellings for up to eight devotees each 
              in dormitory style housing, and for married couples six duplex style 
              buildings providing twelve dwelling units in town house style.</p>
