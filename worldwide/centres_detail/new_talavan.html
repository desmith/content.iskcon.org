            <p><b>History and details of the centre</b><br>
              New Talavana farm community began in June 1974 at the suggestion 
              of His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.</p>
            <p>New Talavana was chosen as a name by Srila Prabhupada while he 
              was visiting the Honolulu temple on May 4th, 1976. (Talavana is 
              one of the twelve forests around Vrndavana. Krishna and His cowherd 
              friends would go there and play, rest, eat and watch their cows 
              as they grazed.)</p>
            <p> At first it was just a few devotees from the New Orleans temple 
              who came and slowly began planting gardens. They worked as time 
              permitted and then returned to the New Orleans temple at night; 
              a round trip of about 130 miles.</p>
            <p> Soon some devotees began staying on the farm full time. The first 
              cow was purchased from a stockyard and the devotees named her Kunti. 
              She gave the farm its first fresh milk as well as its first calf, 
              named Subhadra. Later more cows were purchased.</p>
            <p> The devotees continued to purchase more land over the next ten 
              years. Eventually we reached a total of 1300 acres. This makes New 
              Talavana the second largest Hare Krishna farm community in the world.</p>
            <p> Currently New Talavana produces wheat, fruit, and vegetables. 
              We also have about sixty acres set aside for hay and collect hay 
              from another 100 acres not owned by New Talavana. Krishna's cows 
              also produce fresh milk from which the devotees supply our presiding 
              deities with delightful milk sweets. </p>
            <p><b>Deities</b> 
            <p><b>Panca-Tattva</b><br>
              The first worship at the temple was of a painting of Panca-Tattva. 
              This painting was originally used by the traveling <em>sankirtana 
              </em>parties in New York. From New York, Panca-Tattva traveled to 
              Buffalo, New York where a preaching centre was being groomed to 
              become a temple.</p>
            <p> Panca-Tattva spent a brief time in Buffalo, and then travelled 
              some 1200 miles south to become the first deity in the New Orleans 
              Temple. While at the New Orleans Temple, marble Gaura Nitai deities 
              were installed and Panca-Tattva was moved to New Talavana. <br>
              Panca-Tattva was also being worshiped when Srila Prabhupada visited 
              the farm in 1975.</p>
            <p> The painting was moved off the alter as marble deities were installed. 
              It was eventually moved into the new temple at the end of November 
              1983. It is still hanging on the wall in the main temple room.</p>
            <p><b>Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai<br>
              </b>Installed in 1976The deities of Gaura-Nitai came here from Jaipur, 
              India. They are 36 inch white marble deities of Lord Caitanya (Gaura) 
              and Lord Nityananda (Nitai).</p>
            <p> Gaura-Nitai were installed at New Talavana in the summer of 1976 
              and stood for seven and a half years in the original temple. They 
              were later moved from the original temple to the newly constructed 
              temple in November 1983. They are still being worshiped and are 
              giving great pleasure to all the devotees.</p>
            <p><b>Sri Sri Radha-Radhakanta</b></p>
            <p align="center"><b><img src="../../images/worldwide/centres/carriereRRK.jpg" alt="Sri Sri Radha-Radhakanta" width="350" height="205"></b></p>
            <p><b> </b>While worshiping Garua-Nitai at New Talavana, the devotees 
              wanted to worship Krishna directly, just as the cow heard boys had 
              done in the forest of Talavana in India.</p>
            <p> With this in mind the decision was made to install Krishna-Balarama 
              deities. A letter was sent to Srila Prabhupada at the end of April 
              1976 asking for his advice and blessing in this endeavour.</p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada wrote back that he expected the standard of worship 
              to be very high. &quot;It is feasible only if you have sufficient 
              <em>brahmanas </em>to take nice care. Otherwise no.&quot; Srila 
              Prabhupada continued, &quot;You have seen our Vrndavana temple, 
              also the temple in Melbourne and Los Angeles. So things must be 
              at this standard in order to have a temple. The standard must be 
              very high.&quot;</p>
            <p> With this in mind, and by the will of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, 
              the idea of Krishna-Balarama deities eventually changed. </p>
            <p>The temple president went to Jaipur, India in search of Radha-Krishna 
              deities for New Orleans and also for the Buffalo temple. While in 
              Jaipur, he found a Radha-Krishna set for New Orleans right away.</p>
            <p> The set for Buffalo was taken from two places. Krishna separated 
              from Radha and joined with a Sita to form the Radha-Krishna set 
              for Buffalo. This set was then sent to Buffalo upon their coming 
              from India.</p>
            <p> After the Buffalo temple did not install the deities, they were 
              brought back to New Talavana for several more months. They were 
              finally installed in the original temple in the winter of 1978. 
              They were given the name Radha-Radha Kanta, the same name given 
              to the &quot;sister&quot; set installed in New Orleans. On 28 April 
              1980 they were moved to the new temple. A week later the original 
              temple and place Srila Prabhupada stayed burned to the ground.</p>
            <p><b>Other Information:</b></p>
            <p><b>Cow Protection</b><br>
              We started with one cow in 1974. Kunti was an old Jersey/Holstein 
              mix milk cow purchased from a stockyard. She had a young calf, Subhadra. 
              As time went by more cows were obtained from other ISKCON farms 
              or from other sources. This took the numbers up to over 150 cattle 
              at one time. This included several breeds including Zebu, Guernsey, 
              Brown Swiss, Jersey as well as a mix of cross breeds.</p>
            <p> All cattle are free-range and live a long stress-free life on 
              the farm. They live to an average age of 16 years but several have 
              lived as long as 21 or 22 years.</p>
            <p> Currently we have 132 cows (bulls, cows, ox, etc.) at New Talavana 
              and are milking three.<br>
