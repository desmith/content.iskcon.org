              details of centre</b></p>
            <p> One of Srila Prabhupada's most cherished desires was to establish 
              the New Vrindaban Community in America. He spoke at great length 
              about building a replica of Vrindaban India, where there are seven 
              main temples. In 1968, The New Vrindaban Community was founded in 
              West Virginia to fulfill Prabhupada's dream of an ideal society 
              based on Krishna Consciousness, or love of God. When Prabhupada 
              set down the first guidelines for such a community, the idea seemed 
              out of reach to the small band of devotees struggling through a 
              hard winter on a small, rundown farm. There was no electricity, 
              no running water in their only building, a battered pioneer shack. 
              But when Srila Prabhupada had a vision of &quot;seven temples on 
              the seven hills,&quot; suddenly all obstacles seemed insignificant 
              to his followers. By 1972, the community had expanded from 100 acres 
              to 500 acres.<br>
              The New Vrindaban Holy Dham is set in the beautiful and peaceful 
              Appalachian Mountains in the rural West Virginia Panhandle. This 
              spiritual community has been a place of pilgrimage for many thousands 
              of visitors each year.</p>
            <p>Sri Sri Radha Vrindaban Chandra Mandir, the main temple hall, is 
              the main attraction of many wonderful attractions in the New Vrindaban 
              Community and is usually the first stop for all visitors and pilgrims. 
              &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Apart from the wonderful gardens, other attractions include a gift 
              shop, an organic vegetable garden, snack bar, health shop, and Prabhupada's 
              Palace of Gold.</p>

              Palace of Gold</b>
            <p>In 1973, the devotees decided to build a home for Srila Prabhupada, 
              where he could write all his books and enjoy the clean country air. 
            </p>
            <p>Devotees built Prabhupada's Palace as the first of the seven temples 
              here; a project that took seven hard years. It immediately became 
              the most famous Hare Krishna temple in North America. </p>
            <p>The Palace attracts millions of visitors and is an incredible place 
              of pilgrimage in North America. Tours include ten elaborate marble 
              rooms, gardens, man-made lakes with swans, sculpture, museum, gift 
              shop and restaurant. 
            <p><b>New Vrindavan's Organic Garden<br>
              </b>There are no artificial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, 
              or herbicides used in the gardens. Srila Prabhupada wanted to have 
              a community based on self-sufficiency, and being able to grow one's 
              own food is paramount in becoming self-sufficient. One of our goals 
              has been to grow crops that will store well over the winter so food 
              will be available to our community year-round. We give tours of 
              our gardens and actively speak to groups about the importance of 
              organic and natural living. We explain the health benefits of a 
              diet free of chemicals and preservatives. One goal is to educate 
              people on the medicinal use of foods and of plants and the benefits 
              of a natural diet and lifestyle. We have worked with youth in the 
              area to teach them about organic farming and hard work. 
            <p>Plans are ever expanding to incorporate oxen, a green house and 
              new ways to reach out to and educate people.
