            <h2><strong>ORGANIZATION: </strong>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was established on July 11, 1966 by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (Srila Prabhupada). </h2>
            <p>ISKCON has since grown into a worldwide confederation of full-time practitioners and congregational members. </p>
            <p>Better known as the Hare Krishna movement, ISKCON is comprised of more than 300 temples, 40 rural communities, and 80 restaurants in 71 countries. This nonsectarian, monotheistic movement's mission is to advance the well being of society by promoting the science of Krishna consciousness as taught in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em> and other ancient Vedic scriptures of India </p>
            <p><strong>HISTORY: </strong> ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava <em>sampradaya</em>, or denomination, a monotheistic tradition within Vedic, or Hindu, culture. It is scripturally based on the 5,000-year-old Sanskrit text <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> or “Song of God”. ISKCON traces its spiritual lineage directly to the speaker of that sacred book, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the 16th century, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a direct incarnation of Lord Krishna Himself, revitalized a massive bhakti (devotional) movement of Krishna followers throughout India It was under His direction that hundreds of volumes on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness were compiled. </p>
            <p>In the 19th century, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, a highly regarded scholar and magistrate coming in the line of spiritual teachers from Chaitanya, envisioned the day when Krishna consciousness would spread to the western world. His son, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami, became the guru of Srila Prabhupada and instructed him to make his life's mission the spreading of Krishna consciousness to the West. In 1965, after spending much of his life preparing for his journey, Srila Prabhupada came to America to spread the Krishna philosophy. On July 11, 1966 ISKCON was officially registered in the state of New York and thus began the Hare Krishna movement in America </p>
            <p><strong>PHILOSOPHY: </strong>Krishna is the eternal, all-knowing, omnipresent, all-powerful and all-attractive Supreme God, the same God spoken of in all major scriptures of the world. He is the seed giving father of all living beings, and the sustaining energy of the universe. He is the source of all incarnations of God, including Lord Buddha and Jesus Christ. </p>
            <p>To revive their dormant spiritual awareness, members practice four &quot;principles of religion&quot;: compassion, truthfulness, cleanliness and austerity. To uphold these principles, and to control the mind and senses, practitioners follow four basic regulations: ( 1) No eating meat, fish or eggs; (2) No gambling; (3) No illicit sex; (4) No intoxication of any kind, including tobacco, coffee and tea. According to Vedic scriptures, indulgence in the aforementioned activities disrupts physical, mental and spiritual well-being, and increases anxiety and conflict in society. <strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
            <p>Hare Krishnas believe the goal of life is to develop love of God. Love of God is realized through the practice of bhakti-yoga, the science of devotional service. This ancient yoga system teaches the art of spiritualizing all human activities. To achieve Krishna consciousness effectively, members also chant and meditate upon the maha-mantra, or the holy names of Lord Krishna: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Members also accept that people are not their material bodies, but are spirit souls. All beings are interrelated through Krishna the common father. </p>
            <p><strong>COMMUNITIES: </strong> Congregational members live and work in the general community, practicing Krishna consciousness in their homes and attending the temple on a regular basis. Full-time members devote their entire lives to Krishna consciousness and live in ISKCON run city temples and rural communities throughout the world. </p>
            <p><strong>GOVERNING BODY: </strong>Prior to the passing of Srila Prabhupada in 1977, a Governing Body Commission (GBC) was established consisting of his senior disciples. The GBC oversees the international society. Each ISKCON temple is individually incorporated and manages its affairs through local leadership. </p>
            <p><strong>FOOD FOR LIFE: </strong>In keeping with the ancient Vedic tradition of helping others, ISKCON operates free food programs for the needy through Hare Krishna Food For Life. This program has provided more than 100 million hot, nutritious vegetarian meals to the needy throughout the world. Food For Life is also active in relief work. For instance, in February 2000, after torrential rains poured continuously over Mozambique South Africa Hare Krishna members brought vegetarian stew to the needy villagers by boat. Krishna devotees also drew international praise for their food distribution efforts during the war in Chechnya in 1995. </p>
