      considered the namacarya, the spiritual master in chanting the holy name 

      of Krsna. Though he was born in a Muslim family, Lord Caitanya's devotees 

      respected him as being better than the best of brahmanas. He would not eat 

      or sleep until he finished his daily quota of chanting the name of Krsna 

      300,000 times. Along with Lord Nityananda, Haridasa Thakura spread the chanting 

      of Krsna's name throughout Bengal. In Jagannatha Puri, where Haridasa Thakura 

      spent his later days, Lord Caitanya would regularly send him prasadam and 

      discuss with him topics of Krsna. Haridasa Thakura died chanting Krsna's 

      name in the presence of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. After Haridasa Thakura's 

      death, Lord Caitanya carried his body to the sea and with His own hands 

      buried him in the sand.<br>
