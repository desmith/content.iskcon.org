Gita Jayanti: Celebrating Bhagavad-gita </h1>
  <p>Gita-jayanti celebrates the speaking of  <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> on the plains of  Kurukshetra, 80km (50 miles) north of Delhi.  Devotees  of Krishna  honour the occasion by reciting and discussing  <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>, holding public lectures, and giving copies of the  <em>Gita </em>as gifts.  At Kurukshetra itself, thousands of pilgrims  converge, at the spot where the <em>Gita </em>was spoken.</p>

  <h2>What is Bhagavad-gita?</h2>
  <p>The <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> is a classic scripture which  no educated person should leave unread! It is India's best-known and most respected scripture. </p>

    </div>
    <p><em>Bhagavad-gita</em> is the famous conversation between  Krishna and Arjuna at the start of the battle of  Kurukshetra. The  discussion covers topics that thoughtful people have always pondered:   the soul; the nature of God and our relationship with Him; matter and spirit, and how they interact; knowledge of the  mind and senses; methods of self-realisation, and much besides. </p>
    <p>The science of God as presented in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> is a deep  and fascinating subject,  capable of engaging  people of all  interests and persuasions.  Arjuna poses intelligent questions &ndash;  the questions we would ask, if we met God! &ndash; and Krishna answers in  kind.  The result  is a challenging and far-ranging  philosophical discussion &ndash; not a series of injunctions and exhortations to be  good and pious &ndash; that leaves us well-equipped  to make informed decisions in life.</p>
    <p>And the <em>Gita</em> satisfies the heart as  well as the intellect &ndash; after all, its underlying theme is  loving devotion to the Supreme Person.  As Krishna speaks He charms  us, not only by His words, but by His &ldquo;all-attractive&rdquo;  personality.  As He said Himself, several thousand years ago, this  very week: &ldquo;This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets &hellip;It is everlasting and it is joyfully  performed&rdquo;.  </p>
    <p>So, pick up your own copy for Gita-jayanti or read online and enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Appreciating Bhagavad-gita </h2>
    <p>&quot;The Gita can be seen as the main literary support for the great  religious civilisation of India, the oldest surviving culture in the  world.&quot;<br />
      Thomas Merton, Catholic theologian, monk and author</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;a performance of great originality, of a sublimity of conception, reasoning and diction almost unequalled&quot; <br />      
      Lord Warren Hastings, the first Governor General of India</p>
    <div class="imgBoxLeft"><img src="../../images/festivals/gj1.jpg" alt="Gita Jayanti" width="324" height="231" /></div>
    <p align="left">&quot;I  read the [Bhagavad-gita] for the first time when I was in my country estate  in Silesia and, while doing so, I felt a sense of overwhelming  gratitude to God for having let me live to be acquainted with this  work. It must be the most profound and sublime thing to be found in the  world.&quot;<br />
&quot;The most beautiful, perhaps  the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue ...  perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world has to show.&quot; <br />
 Wilhelm von Humboldt, distinguished German scholar and linguist</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;This is a most inspiring book; it has brought comfort and consolation in my life &ndash; I hope it will do the same to you. Read it.&quot;<br />
    Thomas Carlyle in a letter to Emerson </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;I  owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavat Geeta. It was the first of  books; it was as if an empire spake to us, nothing small or unworthy,  but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which  in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same  questions which exercise us.&quot;<br />
        Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;In the morning  I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the  Bhagavat Geeta ... in comparison with which our modern world and its  literature seem puny and trivial&quot;<br />
      &quot;the reader is nowhere raised into and sustained in a higher or rarer region of thought than in Bhagavad Geeta &quot; <br />
      Henry David Thoreau </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The Gita is one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the
          Perennial Philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not
          only for Indians, but for all mankind&quot;.<br />
        Aldous Huxley</p>
