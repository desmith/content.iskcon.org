<p>Govardhana Hill is in Vrindavana  south of Delhi, and five-thousand years ago, Krishna, the Supreme  Personality of Godhead, lifted it on the little finger of His  left hand.  The occasion is recorded in the sacred book, <em>Srimad  Bhagavatam, </em>and millennia later, is celebrated world-wide, by  thousands of people.</p>

  <p>Festivals such as this help us explore and understand the deep mystery of Krishna&rsquo;s extraordinary  pastimes: how God,  grave and awesome, appears as an enchantingly  beautiful cowherd boy, just to have fun with His friends.  </p>
<p>Although  there are many layers of meaning in Krishna&rsquo;s pastimes, an  essential feature of this story, is the exchanged of deep love  between Krishna and His devotees.  To please Him, the residents of  Vrindavana willingly gave up their secure customs and their very  livelihood; in return Krishna protected them from the resulting  catastrophe.  Under the shelter of Govardhana Hill, Krishna related  with each of His friends according to their individual desires: as a  joking, playful friend with the cowherd boys; as a lover to the  beautiful milk-maids; as a son to his parents.  These intimate and  exquisite loving exchanges, increased their attachment to Krishna and  the devastating storms went by unnoticed.</p>
<p>All this while Krishna jauntily holds  Mount Govardhana aloft, on the littlest finger of the weakest arm, as  if to say, &ldquo;I may look like a little boy, but I <em>am</em> God and  though you may try, you can&rsquo;t mess with Me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Devotees of Krishna celebrate  this festival by reading and discussing the story amongst themselves  and by congregating at their local temple to chant, dance, and offer  mountains of sumptuous foodstuffs (especially sweets!) to Sri Giridhari &ndash; the lifter of  Govardhana Hill.</p>

<p><br />
  May that Sri Govardhana, on whom the deer are standing, gazing down the path in eagerness to see Sri Krsna, mistaking the rustling of the bamboo to be Sri Krsna's flute and thus becoming stunned in ecstasy, fulfill all my desires.<br />
  Srila Visvanatha Chakravati Thakura (17th century)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O Govardhana, you are decorated with beautiful pavilions of pearls and jewelled thrones shaded by trees,  along with caves and valleys, where Krsna always plays with Balarama and the cowherd boys.  I also long to witness those transcendental games.  Kindly allow me to reside close to you. <br />
  Srila Raghunatha das Goswami (1495&ndash;1571)</p>
