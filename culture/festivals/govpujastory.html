  <h2>CHAPTER TWENTY&ndash;FOUR</h2>
  <h2>
    Worshiping Govardhana Hill </h2>
  <p>
    While engaged with the brahmanas  who were too much involved in the performance of Vedic sacrifices, Krsna and  Balarama also saw that the cowherd men were preparing a similar sacrifice in  order to pacify Indra, the King of heaven, who is responsible for supplying  water. As stated in the Caitanya-caritamrta, a devotee of Krsna has strong and  firm faith in the understanding that if he is simply engaged in Krsna  consciousness and Krsna&rsquo;s transcendental loving service, then he is freed from  all other obligations. A pure devotee of Lord Krsna doesn&rsquo;t have to perform any  of the ritualistic functions enjoined in the Vedas; nor is he required to  worship any demigods. Being a devotee of Lord Krsna, one is understood to have  performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and all kinds of worship to the demigods.  One does not develop devotional service for Krsna by performing the Vedic  ritualistic ceremonies or worshiping the demigods, but it should be understood  that one who is engaged fully in the service of the Lord has already fulfilled  all Vedic injunctions.</p><p>
    In order to stop all such  activities by His devotees, Krsna wanted to firmly establish exclusive  devotional service during His presence in Vrndavana. Because He is the omniscient  Personality of Godhead, Krsna knew that the cowherd men were preparing for the  Indra sacrifice, but as a matter of etiquette He began to inquire with great  honor and submission from elder personalities like Maharaja Nanda.</p><p>
    Krsna asked His father,  &ldquo;My dear father, what is this arrangement going on for a great sacrifice? What  is the result of such a sacrifice, and for whom is it meant? How is it  performed? Will you kindly let Me know? I am very eager to know this procedure,  so please explain to Me the purpose of this sacrifice.&rdquo; Upon this inquiry, His  father, Nanda Maharaja, remained silent, thinking that his young boy would not  be able to understand the intricacies of performing the yajna. Krsna, however,  persisted: &ldquo;My dear father, for those who are liberal and saintly, there is no  secrecy. They do not think anyone to be a friend, an enemy or a neutral party,  because they are always open to everyone. And even for those who are not so  liberal, nothing should be kept secret from the family members and friends,  although secrecy may be maintained for persons who are inimical. Therefore you  cannot keep any secrets from Me. All persons are engaged in fruitive  activities. Some know what these activities are, and they know the result, and  some execute activities without knowing the purpose or the result. A person who  acts with full knowledge gets the full result; one who acts without knowledge  does not get such a perfect result. Therefore, please let Me know the purpose  of the sacrifice you are going to perform. Is it according to Vedic injunction?  Or is it simply a popular ceremony? Kindly let Me know in detail about the  sacrifice.&rdquo;</p><p>
    On hearing this inquiry  from Krsna, Maharaja Nanda replied, &ldquo;My dear boy, this ceremonial performance  is more or less traditional. Because rainfall is due to the mercy of King Indra  and the clouds are his representatives, and because water is so important for  our living, we must show some gratitude to the controller of this rainfall, Maharaja  Indra. We are arranging, therefore, to pacify King Indra, because he has very  kindly sent us clouds to pour down a sufficient quantity of rain for successful  agricultural activities. Water is very important: without rainfall we cannot  farm or produce grain, and without grain we cannot live. Therefore rain is  necessary for successful religious ceremonies, economic development and,  ultimately, liberation. So we should not give up this traditional ceremonial  function; if one gives it up, being influenced by lust, greed or fear, then it  does not look very good for him.&rdquo;</p><p>
    After hearing this, Krsna,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the presence of His father and all the  elder cowherd men of Vrndavana, spoke in such a way as to make the heavenly  king, Indra, very angry. He suggested that they forgo the sacrifice. His  reasons for discouraging the sacrifice performed to please Indra were twofold.  First, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita, there is no need to worship the demigods  for any material advancement; all results derived from worshiping the demigods  are simply temporary, and only those who are less intelligent are interested in  temporary results. Second, whatever temporary result one derives from  worshiping the demigods is actually granted by the permission of the Supreme  Personality of Godhead. It is clearly stated in the Bhagavad-gita: mayaiva  vihitan hi tan. Whatever benefit is supposed to be derived from the demigods is  actually bestowed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without the permission  of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot bestow any benefit upon  others. But sometimes the demigods become puffed up by the influence of  material nature; thinking themselves all in all, they forget the supremacy of  the Personality of Godhead. In SrImad-Bhagavatam it is clearly stated that in  this instance Krsna wanted to make King Indra angry. Krsna&rsquo;s advent was  especially meant for the annihilation of the demons and protection of the  devotees. King Indra was certainly a devotee, not a demon, but because he was  puffed up, Krsna wanted to teach him a lesson. He first made Indra angry by  stopping the Indra-puja, which had been arranged by the cowherd men in Vrndavana.</p><p>
    With this purpose in mind,  Krsna began to talk as if He were an atheist supporting the philosophy of  Karma-mImamsa. Advocates of this philosophy do not accept the supreme authority  of the Personality of Godhead. They put forward the argument that if anyone  works nicely, the result is sure to come. Their opinion is that even if there  is a God who gives man the result of his fruitive activities, there is no need  to worship Him because unless man works He cannot bestow any good result. They  say that instead of worshiping a demigod or God, people should give attention  to their own duties, and thus the good result will surely come. Lord Krsna began  to speak to His father according to these principles of the Karma-mImamsa  philosophy. &ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need to worship any  demigod for the successful performance of your agricultural activities. Every  living being is born according to his past karma and leaves this life simply  taking the result of his present karma. Everyone is born in different types or  species of life according to his past activities, and he gets his next birth  according to the activities of this life. Different grades of material happiness  and distress, comforts and disadvantages of life, are different results of  different kinds of activities, from either the past or present life.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Maharaja Nanda and other elder  members argued that without satisfying the predominating god one cannot derive  any good result simply by material activities. This is actually the fact. For example,  it is sometimes found that in spite of first-class medical help and treatment  by a first-class physician, a diseased person dies. It is concluded, therefore,  that first-class medical treatment or the attempts of a first-class physician  are not in themselves the cause for curing a patient; there must be the hand of  the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, a father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s taking  care of their children is not the cause of the children&rsquo;s comfort. Sometimes it  is found that in spite of all care by the parents, the children go bad or  succumb to death. Therefore material causes are not sufficient for results. There  must be the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nanda Maharaja therefore  advocated that in order to get good results for agricultural activities, they must  satisfy Indra, the superintending deity of the rain supply. Lord Krsna nullified  this argument, saying that the demigods give results only to persons who have executed  their prescribed duties. The demigods cannot give any good results to the person  who has not executed the prescribed duties; therefore demigods are dependent on  the execution of duties and are not absolute in awarding good results to anyone.  So why should one care about them?</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; Lord Krsna  said, &ldquo;there is no need to worship the demigod Indra. Everyone has to achieve  the result of his own work. We can actually see that one becomes busy according  to the natural tendency of his work; and according to that natural tendency,  all living entities&mdash;whether human beings or demigods&mdash;achieve their respective  results. All living entities achieve higher or lower bodies and create enemies,  friends or neutral parties only because of their different kinds of work. One  should be careful to discharge duties according to his natural instinct and not  divert attention to the worship of various demigods. The demigods will be  satisfied by proper execution of all duties, so there is no need to worship them.  Let us, rather, perform our prescribed duties very nicely. Actually, one cannot  be happy without executing his proper prescribed duty. One who does not, therefore,  properly discharge his prescribed duties is compared to an unchaste wife. The  proper prescribed duty of the brahmanas is the study of the Vedas; the proper  duty of the royal order, the ksatriyas, is engagement in protecting the citizens;  the proper duty of the vaisya community is agriculture, trade and protection of  the cows; and the proper duty of the sudras is service to the higher classes,  namely the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. We belong to the vaisya community,  and our proper duty is to farm, to trade with the agricultural produce, to  protect cows or to take to banking.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Krsna identified Himself  with the vaisya community because Nanda Maharaja was protecting many cows and Krsna  was taking care of them. He enumerated four kinds of business engagements for  the vaisya community, namely agriculture, trade, protection of cows and  banking. Although the vaisyas can take to any of these occupations, the men of  Vrndavana were engaged primarily in the protection of cows.</p><p>
    Krsna further explained to  His father, &ldquo;This cosmic manifestation is going on under the influence of three  modes of material nature&mdash;goodness, passion and ignorance. These three modes are  the causes of creation, maintenance and destruction. The cloud is caused by the  action of the mode of passion; therefore it is the mode of passion which causes  the rainfall. And after the rainfall, the living entities derive the result&mdash;success  in agricultural work. What, then, has Indra to do with this affair? Even if you  do not please Indra, what can he do? We do not derive any special benefit from  Indra. Even if he is there, he pours water on the ocean also, where there is no  need of water. So he is pouring water on the ocean or on the land; it does not  depend on our worshiping him. As far as we are concerned, we do not need to go  to another city or village or foreign country. There are palatial buildings in  the cities, but we are satisfied living in this forest of Vrndavana.  Our specific relationship is with Govardhana Hill and Vrndavana forest and  nothing more. I therefore request you, My dear father, to begin a sacrifice  which will satisfy the local brahmanas and Govardhana Hill, and let us have  nothing to do with Indra.&rdquo;</p><p>
    After hearing this statement  by Krsna, Nanda Maharaja replied, &ldquo;My dear boy, since You are asking, I shall  arrange for a separate sacrifice for the local brahmanas and Govardhana Hill.  But for the present let me execute this sacrifice known as Indra-yajna.&rdquo;</p><p>
    But Krsna replied, &ldquo;My dear  father, don&rsquo;t delay. The sacrifice you propose for Govardhana and the local brahmanas  will take much time. Better take the arrangement and paraphernalia you have  already made for the Indra-yajna and immediately engage them to satisfy  Govardhana Hill and the local brahmanas.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Maharaja Nanda finally relented.  The cowherd men then inquired from Krsna how He wanted the yajna performed, and  Krsna gave them the following directions. &ldquo;Prepare very nice foods of all descriptions  from the grain and ghee collected for the yajna. Prepare rice, dhal, then halava,  pakora, purI and all kinds of milk preparations, such as sweet rice, rabrI, sweetballs,  sandesa, rasagulla and laddu, and invite the learned brahmanas who can chant  the Vedic hymns and offer oblations to the fire. The brahmanas should be given  all kinds of grain in charity. Then decorate all the cows and feed them well.  After performing this, give money in charity to the brahmanas. As far as the  lower animals are concerned, such as the dogs, and the lower grades of people,  such as the candalas, or the fifth class of men, who are considered untouchable,  they also may be given sumptuous prasadam. After nice grasses have been given  to the cows, the sacrifice known as Govardhana-puja may immediately begin. This  sacrifice will very much satisfy Me.&rdquo;</p><p>
    In this statement, Lord Krsna  practically described the whole economy of the vaisya community. In all  communities in human society&mdash;including the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras,  candalas, etc.&mdash;and in the animal kingdom&mdash;including the cows, dogs, goats, etc.&mdash;everyone  has his part to play. Each is to work in cooperation for the total benefit of  all society, which includes not only animate objects but also inanimate objects  like hills and land. The vaisya community is specifically responsible for the economic  improvement of the society by producing grain, by giving protection to the  cows, by transporting food when needed, and by banking and finance.</p><p>
    From this statement we learn  also that although the cats and dogs, which have now become so important, are  not to be neglected, cow protection is actually more important than protection  of cats and dogs. Another hint we get from this statement is that the candalas,  or the untouchables, are also not to be neglected by the higher classes and  should be given necessary protection. Everyone is important, but some are directly  responsible for the advancement of human society and some are only indirectly  responsible. However, when Krsna consciousness is there, then everyone&rsquo;s total  benefit is taken care of.</p><p>
    The sacrifice known as  Govardhana-puja is observed in the Krsna consciousness movement. Lord Caitanya  has recommended that since Krsna is worshipable, so His land&mdash;Vrndavana and  Govardhana Hill&mdash;is also worshipable. To confirm this statement, Lord Krsna said  that Govardhana-puja is as good as worship of Him. From that day, Govardhana-puja  has been going on and is known as Annakuta. In all the temples of Vrndavana or  outside of Vrndavana, huge quantities of food are prepared in this ceremony and  are very sumptuously distributed to the general population. Sometimes the food  is thrown to the crowds, and they enjoy collecting it off the ground. From this  we can understand that prasadam offered to Krsna never becomes polluted or contaminated,  even if it is thrown on the ground. The people therefore collect and eat it  with great satisfaction.</p><p>
    The Supreme Personality of  Godhead, Krsna, therefore advised the cowherd men to stop the Indra-yajna and  begin the Govardhana-puja in order to chastise Indra, who was very much puffed  up at being the supreme controller of the heavenly planets. The honest and  simple cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, accepted Krsna&rsquo;s proposal and executed  in detail everything He advised. They performed Govardhana worship and  circumambulation of the hill. (Following the inauguration of Govardhana-puja,  people in Vrndavana still dress nicely and assemble near Govardhana Hill to  offer worship and circumambulate the hill, leading their cows all around.)  According to the instruction of Lord Krsna, Nanda Maharaja and the cowherd men  called in learned brahmanas and began to worship Govardhana Hill by chanting Vedic  hymns and offering prasadam. The inhabitants of Vrndavana assembled together,  decorated their cows and gave them grass. Keeping the cows in front, they began  to circumambulate Govardhana Hill. The gopIs dressed themselves very  luxuriantly and sat in bull-driven carts, chanting the glories of Krsna&rsquo;s  pastimes. The brahmanas, assembled there to act as priests for Govardhana-puja,  offered their blessings to the cowherd men and their wives, the gopIs.</p><p>
    When everything was complete,  Krsna assumed a great transcendental form and declared to the inhabitants of Vrndavana  that He was Himself Govardhana Hill in order to convince the devotees that  Govardhana Hill and Krsna Himself are identical. Then Krsna began to eat all  the food offered there. The identity of Krsna and Govardhana Hill is still  honored, and great devotees take rocks from Govardhana Hill and worship them exactly  as they worship the Deity of Krsna in the temples. The followers of the Krsna  consciousness movement may therefore collect small rocks or pebbles from  Govardhana Hill and worship them at home, because this worship is as good as Deity  worship. The form of Krsna who began to eat the offerings was separately  constituted, and Krsna Himself, along with the other inhabitants of Vrndavana,  offered obeisances to the Deity as well as Govardhana Hill. In offering obeisances  to the huge form of Krsna and Govardhana Hill, Krsna declared, &ldquo;Just see how  Govardhana Hill has assumed this huge form and is favoring us by accepting all  the offerings!&rdquo; Krsna also declared at that meeting, &ldquo;One who neglects the  worship of Govardhana-puja, as I am personally conducting it, will not be  happy. There are many snakes on Govardhana Hill, and persons neglecting the prescribed  duty of Govardhana-puja will be bitten by these snakes and killed. In order to  assure the good fortune of the cows and themselves, all people of Vrndavana near  Govardhana must worship the hill, as prescribed by Me.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Thus performing the  Govardhana-puja sacrifice, all the inhabitants of Vrndavana followed the  instructions of Krsna, the son of Vasudeva, and afterwards they returned to their  respective homes.</p><p>
    Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta  purport of the Twenty-fourth Chapter of Krsna, &ldquo;Worshiping Govardhana Hill.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER TWENTY&ndash;FIVE</h2>
    <h2>
      Devastating Rainfall in Vrndavana</h2>
    <p>
    When Indra understood that  the sacrifice which was to be offered by the cowherd men in Vrndavana had been  stopped by Krsna, he became angry, and he vented his anger upon the inhabitants  of Vrndavana, who were headed by Nanda Maharaja, although Indra knew perfectly  well that Krsna was personally protecting them. As the director of different  kinds of clouds, Indra called for the Samvartaka. This cloud is invited when  there is a need to devastate the whole cosmic manifestation. The Samvartaka was  ordered by Indra to go over Vrndavana and inundate the whole area with an extensive  flood. Demonically, Indra thought himself to be the all-powerful supreme personality.  When demons become very powerful, they defy the supreme controller, the Personality  of Godhead. Indra, though not a demon, was puffed up by his material position,  and he wanted to challenge the supreme controller. He thought himself, at least  for the time being, as powerful as Krsna. Indra said, &ldquo;Just see the impudence  of the inhabitants of Vrndavana! They are simply inhabitants of the forest, but  being infatuated with their friend Krsna, who is nothing but an ordinary human  being, they have dared to defy the demigods.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Krsna has declared in the  Bhagavad-gita that the worshipers of the demigods are not very intelligent. He  has also declared that one has to give up all kinds of worship and simply concentrate  on Krsna consciousness. Krsna&rsquo;s invoking the anger of Indra and later on  chastising him is a clear indication to His devotees that those who are engaged  in Krsna consciousness have no need to worship any demigod, even if it is found  that the demigod has become angry. Krsna gives His devotees all protection, and  they should completely depend on His mercy.</p><p>
    Indra cursed the action of  the inhabitants of Vrndavana and said, &ldquo;By defying the authority of the demigods,  the inhabitants of Vrndavana will suffer in material existence. Having neglected  the sacrifice to the demigods, they cannot cross over the impediments of the  ocean of material existence.&rdquo; Indra further declared, &ldquo;These cowherd men in Vrndavana  have neglected my authority on the advice of this talkative boy who is known as  Krsna. He is nothing but a child, and by believing this child, they have enraged  me.&rdquo; Thus he ordered the Samvartaka cloud to go and destroy the prosperity of Vrndavana.  &ldquo;The men of Vrndavana,&rdquo; said Indra, &ldquo;have become too puffed up over their material  opulence and are overconfident due to the presence of their tiny friend, Krsna.  He is simply talkative, childish and unaware of the complete cosmic situation,  although He is thinking Himself very advanced in knowledge. Because they have  taken Krsna so seriously, they must be punished. They should be destroyed with  their cows.&rdquo; In this way Indra ordered the Samvartaka cloud to go to Vrndavana  and inundate the place.</p><p>
    It is indicated here that  in the villages or outside the towns, the inhabitants must depend on the cows  for their prosperity. When the cows are destroyed, the people are destitute of  all kinds of opulences. When King Indra ordered the Samvartaka and companion  clouds to go to Vrndavana, the clouds were afraid of doing this mischief. But  King Indra assured them, &ldquo;You go ahead, and I will also go, riding on my elephant,  accompanied by great storms. And I shall apply all my strength to punishing the  inhabitants of Vrndavana.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Ordered by King Indra, all  the dangerous clouds appeared above Vrndavana and began to pour water incessantly,  with all their strength and power. There was constant lightning and thunder,  blowing of severe wind, and incessant falling of rain. The rain seemed to fall  like piercing sharp arrows. By pouring water as thick as pillars, without cessation,  the clouds gradually filled all the lands in Vrndavana with water, and there  was no visible distinction between higher and lower land. The situation was very  dangerous, especially for the animals. The rainfall was accompanied by great  winds, and every living creature in Vrndavana began to tremble from the severe  cold. Unable to find any other source of deliverance, they all approached  Govinda to take shelter at His lotus feet. The cows especially, being much  aggrieved from the heavy rain, bowed down their heads, and taking their calves  underneath their bodies, they approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead to  take shelter of His lotus feet. At that time all the inhabitants of Vrndavana  began to pray to Lord Krsna. &ldquo;Dear Krsna,&rdquo; they prayed, &ldquo;You are all-powerful,  and You are very affectionate to Your devotees. Now please protect us, who have  been much harassed by angry Indra.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Upon hearing their prayer,  Krsna could understand that Indra, being bereft of his sacrificial honor, was  pouring down rain that was accompanied by heavy pieces of ice and strong winds,  although all this was out of season. Krsna understood that this was a deliberate  exhibition of anger by Indra. He therefore concluded, &ldquo;This demigod who thinks  himself supreme has shown his great power, but I shall answer him according to  My position, and I shall teach him that he is not autonomous in managing universal  affairs. I am the Supreme Lord over all, and I shall thus take away his false  prestige, which has risen from his power. The demigods are My devotees, and therefore  it is not possible for them to forget My supremacy, but somehow or other he has  become puffed up with material power and thus is now maddened. I shall act in  such a way as to relieve him of this false prestige. I shall give protection to  My pure devotees in Vrndavana, who are at present completely dependent on My mercy  and whom I have taken completely under My protection. I must save them by My  mystic power.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Thinking in this way, Lord  Krsna immediately picked up Govardhana Hill with one hand, exactly as a child  picks up a mushroom from the ground. Thus He exhibited His transcendental  pastime of lifting Govardhana Hill. Lord Krsna then addressed His devotees, &ldquo;My  dear brothers, My dear father, My dear inhabitants of Vrndavana, you can now  safely enter under the umbrella of Govardhana Hill, which I have just lifted.  Do not be afraid of the hill and think that it will fall from My hand. You have  been too much afflicted from the heavy rain and strong wind; therefore I have  lifted this hill, which will protect you exactly like a huge umbrella. I think  this is a proper arrangement to relieve you of your immediate distress. Be  happy along with your animals underneath this great umbrella.&rdquo; Being assured by  Lord Krsna, all the inhabitants of Vrndavana entered beneath the great hill  along with their property and animals, and they all appeared to be safe.</p><p>
    The inhabitants of Vrndavana  and their animals remained there for one week without being disturbed by hunger,  thirst or any other discomforts. They were simply astonished to see how Krsna  was holding up the mountain with the little finger of His left hand. Seeing the  extraordinary mystic power of Krsna, Indra, the King of heaven, was thunderstruck  and baffled in his determination. He immediately called for all the clouds and  asked them to desist. When the sky became completely cleared of all clouds and  there was sunrise again, the strong wind stopped. At that time Krsna, the Supreme  Personality of Godhead, known now as the lifter of Govardhana Hill, said, &ldquo;My  dear cowherd men, now you can leave and take your wives, children, cows and  valuables, because everything is ended. The inundation has gone down, along  with the swelling waters of the river.&rdquo;</p><p>
    All the men loaded their  valuables on carts and slowly left with their cows and other paraphernalia.  After they had cleared out everything, Lord Krsna very slowly replaced  Govardhana Hill in exactly the same position it had been before. When everything  was done, all the inhabitants of Vrndavana approached Krsna with feelings of love  and embraced Him with great ecstasy. The gopIs, being naturally very affectionate  to Krsna, began to offer Him yogurt mixed with their tears, and they poured  incessant blessings upon Him. Mother Yasoda, mother RohinI, Nanda and Balarama,  who is the strongest of the strong, embraced Krsna one after another and, from  spontaneous feelings of affection, blessed Him over and over again. In the heavens,  different demigods from different planetary systems, such as Siddhaloka,  Gandharvaloka and Caranaloka, also began to show their complete satisfaction.  They poured showers of flowers on the surface of the earth and sounded different  conchshells. There was beating of drums, and being inspired by godly feelings,  residents of Gandharvaloka began to play on their tambouras to please the Lord.  After this incident, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, surrounded by His dear  friends and the animals, returned to His home. As usual, the gopIs began to  chant the glorious pastimes of Lord Krsna with great feeling, for they were  chanting from the heart.</p><p>
    Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta  purport of the Twenty-fifth Chapter of Krsna, &ldquo;Devastating Rainfall in Vrndavana.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER TWENTY&ndash;SIX</h2>
    <h2>
      Wonderful Krsna</h2>
    <p>
    Without understanding the  intricacies of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and without knowing  His uncommon spiritual opulences, the innocent cowherd boys and men of Vrndavana  began to discuss the wonderful activities of Krsna, which surpass the activities  of all men.</p><p>
    One of them said, &ldquo;My dear  friends, considering His wonderful activities, how is it possible that such an  uncommon boy would come and live with us in Vrndavana? It is really not  possible. Just imagine! He is now only seven years old! How is it possible for  Him to lift Govardhana Hill in one hand and hold it up just as the king of elephants  holds a lotus flower? To lift a lotus flower is a most insignificant thing for  an elephant, and similarly Krsna lifted Govardhana Hill without exertion. When  He was simply a small baby and could not even see properly, He killed a great  demon, Putana. While sucking her breast, He also sucked out her life air. Krsna  killed the Putana demon exactly as eternal time kills a living creature in due  course. When He was only three months old, He was sleeping underneath a  hand-driven cart. Being hungry for His mother&rsquo;s breast, He began to cry and  throw His legs upwards. And from the kicking of His small feet the cart immediately  broke apart and fell to pieces. When He was only one year old, He was carried  away by the Trnavarta demon disguised as a whirlwind, and although He was taken  very high in the sky, He simply hung on the neck of the demon and forced him to  fall from the sky and immediately die. Once His mother, being disturbed by His  stealing butter, tied Him to a wooden mortar, and the child pulled it toward a  pair of trees known as yamala-arjuna and caused them to fall. Once, when He was  engaged in tending the calves in the forest along with His elder brother, Balarama,  a demon named Bakasura appeared, and Krsna at once bifurcated the demon&rsquo;s beak.  When the demon known as Vatsasura entered among the calves tended by Krsna with  a desire to kill Him, He immediately detected the demon, killed him and threw  him into a tree. When Krsna, along with His brother, Balarama, entered the Talavana  forest, the demon known as Dhenukasura, in the shape of an ass, attacked Them  and was immediately killed by Balarama, who caught his hind legs and threw him  into a palm tree. Although the Dhenukasura demon was assisted by his cohorts,  also in the shape of asses, all were killed, and the Talavana forest was then  open for the use of the animals and inhabitants of Vrndavana. When Pralambasura  entered amongst Krsna&rsquo;s cowherd boyfriends, Krsna caused him to be killed by  Balarama. Thereafter, Krsna saved His friends and cows from a severe forest  fire, and He chastised the Kaliya serpent in the lake of the Yamuna River  and forced him to leave the vicinity of the Yamuna; He thereby made the water  of the Yamuna poisonless.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Another one of the friends  of Nanda Maharaja said, &ldquo;My dear Nanda, we do not know why we are so attracted  by your son Krsna. We want to forget Him, but this is impossible. Why are we so  naturally affectionate toward Him? Just imagine how wonderful it is! On one  hand He is only a boy of seven years, and on the other hand there is a huge  hill like Govardhana Hill, and He lifted it so easily! O Nanda Maharaja, we are  now in great doubt&mdash;your son Krsna must be one of the demigods. He is not at all  an ordinary boy. Maybe He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&rdquo;</p><p>
    On hearing the praises of  the cowherd men in Vrndavana, King Nanda said, &ldquo;My dear friends, in reply to  you I can simply present the statement of Garga Muni so that your doubts may be  cleared. When he came to perform the name-giving ceremony, he said that this  boy descends in different periods of time in different colors and that this  time He has appeared in Vrndavana in a blackish color, known as krsna. Previously  He had a white color, then a red color, then a yellow color. He also said that  this boy was once the son of Vasudeva, and everyone who knows of His previous  birth calls Him Vasudeva. Actually, he said that my son has many varieties of  names, according to His different qualities and activities. Gargacarya assured  me that this boy would be all-auspicious for my family and that He would be  able to give transcendental blissful pleasure to all the cowherd men and cows  in Vrndavana. Even though we would be put into various kinds of difficulties,  by the grace of this boy we would be very easily freed from them. He also said  that formerly this boy saved the world from an unregulated condition, and He  saved all honest men from the hands of the dishonest thieves. He also said that  any fortunate man who becomes attached to this boy, Krsna, is never vanquished  or defeated by his enemy. On the whole, He is exactly like Lord Visnu, who  always takes the side of the demigods, who are consequently never defeated by  the demons. Gargacarya thus concluded that my child would grow to be exactly  like Visnu in transcendental beauty, qualification, activities, influence and  opulence, and so we should not be very astonished by His wonderful activities.  After telling me this, Gargacarya returned home, and since then we have been  continually seeing the wonderful activities of this child. According to the version  of Gargacarya, I consider that He must be Narayana Himself, or maybe a plenary  portion of Narayana.&rdquo;</p><p>
    When all the cowherd men  had very attentively heard the statements of Gargacarya through Nanda Maharaja,  they better appreciated the wonderful activities of Krsna and became very  jubilant and satisfied. They began to praise Nanda Maharaja, because by  consulting him their doubts about Krsna were cleared. They said, &ldquo;Let Krsna,  who is so kind, beautiful and merciful, protect us. When angry Indra sent torrents  of rain, accompanied by showers of ice blocks and high wind, He immediately  took compassion upon us and saved us and our families, cows and valuable possessions  by picking up Govardhana Hill, just as a child picks up a mushroom. He saved us  so wonderfully. May He continue to glance mercifully over us and our cows. May  we live peacefully under the protection of wonderful Krsna.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta  purport of the Twenty-sixth Chapter of Krsna, &ldquo;Wonderful Krsna.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER TWENTY&ndash;SEVEN</h2>
    <h2>
      Prayers by Indra, the King  of Heaven</h2>
    <p>
    When Krsna saved the  inhabitants of Vrndavana from the wrath of Indra by lifting Govardhana Hill, a  surabhi cow from Goloka Vrndavana, as well as King Indra from the heavenly  planets, appeared before Him. Indra, the King of heaven, was conscious of his  offense before Krsna; therefore he stealthily appeared before Him in a secluded  place. He immediately fell down at the lotus feet of Krsna, although his own  crown was dazzling like sunshine. Indra knew about the exalted position of Krsna  because Krsna is the master of Indra, but he could not believe that Krsna could  come down and live in Vrndavana among the cowherd men. When Krsna defied the  authority of Indra, Indra became angry because he thought that he was all in  all within this universe and that no one was as powerful as he. But after this  incident, his false, puffed-up prestige was destroyed. Being conscious of his  subordinate position, he appeared before Krsna with folded hands and began to  offer the following prayers.</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear Lord,&rdquo; Indra  said, &ldquo;being puffed up by my false prestige, I thought that You had offended me  by not allowing the cowherd men to perform the Indra-yajna, and I thought that  You wanted to enjoy the offerings that were arranged for the sacrifice. I  thought that in the name of a Govardhana sacrifice You were taking my share of  profit, and therefore I mistook Your position. Now by Your grace I can understand  that You are the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, and that You are  transcendental to all material qualities. Your transcendental position is visuddha-sattva,  which is above the platform of the material mode of goodness, and Your transcendental  abode is beyond the disturbance of the material qualities. Your name, fame,  form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes are all beyond this material nature,  and they are never disturbed by the three material modes. Your abode is accessible  only for one who undergoes severe austerities and penances and becomes completely  freed from the onslaught of material qualities like passion and ignorance. If  someone thinks that when You enter within this material world You accept the  modes of material nature, he is mistaken. The waves of the material qualities  are never able to touch You, and You certainly do not accept them when You are  present within this world. Your Lordship is never conditioned by the laws of  material nature.</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear Lord, You are the  original father of this cosmic manifestation. You are the supreme spiritual  master of this cosmic world, and You are the original proprietor of everything.  As eternal time, You are competent to chastise offenders. Within this material  world there are many fools like me who consider themselves to be the Supreme  Lord or the all in all within the universe. You are so merciful that without  accepting their offenses You devise means so that their false prestige is  subdued and they can know that You, and no one else, are the Supreme Personality  of Godhead.</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear Lord, You are the  supreme father, the supreme spiritual master and the supreme king. Therefore,  You have the right to chastise all living entities whenever there is any discrepancy  in their behavior. The father, the spiritual master and the supreme executive  officer of the state are always well-wishers of their sons, their students and  their citizens respectively. As such, the well-wishers have the right to  chastise their dependents. By Your own desire You appear auspiciously on the earth  in Your eternal varieties of forms; You come to glorify the earthly planet and  specifically to chastise persons who are falsely claiming to be God. In the  material world there is regular competition between different types of living entities  to become supreme leaders of society, and after being frustrated in achieving  the supreme positions of leadership, foolish persons claim to be God, the Supreme  Personality. There are many such foolish personalities in this world, like me,  but in due course of time, when they come to their senses, they surrender unto  You and again engage themselves properly by rendering service unto You. And  that is the purpose of Your chastising persons envious of You.</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear Lord, I committed  a great offense unto Your lotus feet, being falsely proud of my material opulences,  not knowing Your unlimited power. Therefore, my Lord, kindly excuse me, because  I am fool number one. Kindly give me Your blessings so that I may not act so  foolishly again. If You think, my Lord, that the offense is very great and  cannot be excused, then I appeal to You that I am Your eternal servant; You  appear in this world to give protection to Your eternal servants and to destroy  the demons who maintain great military strength just to burden the very existence  of the earth. As I am Your eternal servant, kindly excuse me.</p><p>
  &ldquo;My dear Lord, You are the  Supreme Personality of Godhead. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because  You are the Supreme Person and the Supreme Soul. You are the son of Vasudeva,  and You are the Supreme Lord, Krsna, the master of all pure devotees. Please  accept my prostrated obeisances. You are the personification of supreme knowledge.  You can appear anywhere, according to Your desire, in any one of Your eternal  forms. You are the root of all creation and the Supreme Soul of all living entities.  Due to my gross ignorance, I created a great disturbance in Vrndavana by sending  torrents of rain and a heavy hailstorm. I acted out of severe anger caused by  Your stopping the sacrifice which was to be held to satisfy me. But, my dear  Lord, You are so kind to me that You have bestowed Your mercy upon me by destroying  all my false pride. I therefore take shelter of Your lotus feet. My dear Lord,  You are not only the supreme controller but also the spiritual master of all  living entities.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Thus praised by Indra,  Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, smiled beautifully and then replied  in a grave voice like a rumbling cloud: &ldquo;My dear Indra, I stopped your  sacrifice just to show you My causeless mercy and to remind you that I am your  eternal master. I am the master not only of you but of all the other demigods  as well. You should always remember that all your material opulences are due to  My mercy. No living entity can independently become opulent; one must be favored  by My mercy. Everyone should always remember that I am the Supreme Lord. I can  show anyone My favor, and I can chastise anyone, because no one is superior to  Me. If I find someone overpowered by false pride, in order to show him My causeless  mercy I withdraw all his opulences.&rdquo;</p><p>
    It is noteworthy that Krsna  sometimes removes all of a rich man&rsquo;s opulences in order to facilitate his becoming  a soul surrendered to Him. This is a special favor of the Lord&rsquo;s. Sometimes it  is seen that a person is very opulent materially, but due to his devotional service  to the Lord he may be reduced to poverty. One should not think, however, that  because he worshiped the Supreme Lord he became poverty-stricken. The real  purport is that when a person is a pure devotee but at the same time, by  miscalculation, wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord shows His special  mercy by taking away all material opulences until at last he surrenders unto  the Supreme Lord.</p><p>
    After instructing Indra,  Lord Krsna asked him to return to his kingdom in the heavenly planets and to remember  always that he is never the supreme but is always subordinate to the Supreme Personality  of Godhead. He also advised him to remain as King of heaven but to be careful  of false pride.</p><p>
    After this, the transcendental  surabhi cow who had come with Indra to see Krsna offered her respectful obeisances  unto Him and worshiped Him. The surabhi offered her prayer as follows: &ldquo;My dear  Lord Krsna, You are the most powerful of all mystic yogIs because You are the  soul of the complete universe, and only from You has all this cosmic manifestation  taken place. Therefore, although Indra tried his best to kill my descendant  cows in Vrndavana, they remained under Your shelter, and You have protected them  all so well. We do not know anyone else as the Supreme, nor do we go to any  other god or demigods for protection. Therefore, You are our Indra, You are the  supreme father of the whole cosmic manifestation, and You are the protector and  elevator of all the cows, brahmanas, demigods and others who are pure devotees  of Your Lordship. O Supersoul of the universe, let us bathe You with our milk,  for You are our Indra. O Lord, You appear just to diminish the burden of impure  activities on the earth.&rdquo;</p><p>
    Then the surabhi cow bathed  Krsna with her milk, and Indra bathed Him with the water of the celestial Ganges through the trunk of his carrier elephant. After  this, the surabhi cows and all the demigods and their mothers joined the heavenly  king, Indra, in worshiping Lord Krsna by bathing Him with Ganges  water and the milk of the surabhis. Thus Govinda, Lord Krsna, was pleased with  all of them. The residents of all higher planetary systems, such as  Gandharvaloka, Vidyadharaloka, Siddhaloka and Caranaloka, all combined and  glorified the Lord by chanting His holy name as their wives and damsels danced  with great joy. They very much satisfied the Lord by incessantly pouring flowers  from the sky. When everything was very nicely and joyfully settled, the cows  overflooded the surface of the earth with their milk. The water of the rivers  began to flow with various tasty liquids and give nourishment to the trees,  producing fruits and flowers of different colors and tastes. The trees began to  pour drops of honey. The hills and mountains began to produce potent medicinal  plants and valuable stones. Because of Krsna&rsquo;s presence, all these things happened  very nicely, and the lower animals, who were generally envious of one another,  were envious no longer.</p><p>
    After satisfying Krsna,  who is the Lord of all the cows in Vrndavana and who is known as Govinda, King  Indra took His permission to return to his heavenly kingdom. As he passed  through cosmic space, he was surrounded by all kinds of demigods. This great  incident is a powerful example of how Krsna consciousness can benefit the  world. Even the lower animals forget their envious nature and become elevated  to the qualities of the demigods.</p><p>
    Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta  purport of the Twenty-seventh Chapter of Krsna, &ldquo;Prayers by Indra, the King of  Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>
