Kartikka: <strong>Season of Mists  and Mellow Pilgrimage</strong></h1>

  
  <p><span class="imgBoxLeft"><img src="../../images/festivals/kartik.jpg" alt="Vrindavana" width="400" height="233" class="left" /></span>Autumn inspires poetry: with its delicate morning mists and  dew-spangled spiders-webs; golden sunshine and the smell of bonfires and autumn  leaves. In Celtic lore, this is the season when the veil between this world and  the &lsquo;other&rsquo; is thinner than normal.</p>
  <p>For Vaisnavas, the charms of autumn are enhanced by the  season of Karttika: the lunar month that falls across October and November.  This month is described as especially dear to Krishna, and Vaisnavas keep it  sacred to acts of devotion and vows of austerity aimed at increasing their  spiritual strength and drawing closer to Krishna. </p>
  <p>Devotees of Krishna may vow to rise earlier; to chant the  Lord&rsquo;s names more frequently; to spend more time reading scripture; to eat less,  or more simply. They also observe the daily offering of a lighted candle or  ghee-lamp to Krishna, while singing the <em>Damodarastaka</em> prayers, which  celebrate one of the most loved of Krishna&rsquo;s pastimes. </p>
  <p><img src="../../images/festivals/jartik1.jpg" alt="Peacock in Vrindavana" width="400" height="224" class="imgBoxRight" />Several of the more sublime festivals fall in this period:  the celebration of Krishna&rsquo;s <em>rasa-lila </em>(dancing with the <em>gopis</em>),  and the appearance-day of Sri Radha-kunda, for example, as well as  Govardhana-puja. Karttika is a mixture of austerity and sweetness, as devotees  try to lessen their bodily needs, while correspondingly spending more time with  Krishna.</p>
  <p>Many Vaisnavas from all over the world set off on pilgrimage  to Vrindavana, the land of Krishna, at this time. At ISKCON&rsquo;s Krishna-Balarama  temple in Vrindavana, guest-houses and living-quarters strain at the seams as  throngs of devotees arrive for Karttika. Leaving their ordinary lives behind  for a few weeks, the pilgrims visit the sacred sites of Krishna&rsquo;s pastimes and  take part in the lively <em>kirtan </em>(chanting) parties, at the temple. It&rsquo;s  worth the effort just to be able to chant and dance in such huge numbers;  families in particular find this a good time to be together in a spiritual  atmosphere, away from school and jobs. Children enjoy the <em>kirtans </em>and  the offering of lights which is beautiful when seen in mass like this.</p>
