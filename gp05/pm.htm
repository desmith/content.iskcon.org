  <h3>Who is Lord Caitanya? </h3>
  <p> Discovering <img src="gaura5.jpg" width="75" height="123" class="right">Sri Caitanya, his personality, and teachings, has been a surprising revelation to many outside India over the last few decades. Thoughtful people, those concerned with the plight of our world, seekers of truth and a spiritual path, and people simply looking for personal happiness, have been surprised to discover such profound and vital truth in such an unexpected place. After all, who has heard of Lord Caitanya!</p>
  <p> Yet, for 500 years Lord Caitanya has been acknowledged as the spiritual leader for our age by many of India&rsquo;s most respected philosophers.</p>
  <p> In the fifteenth century, Sri Caitanya created a spiritual revolution in India , attracting followers from all levels of society. Kings, government ministers, scholars, poets, people of all religions and people of none, the rich, the poor, all were moved to take part in his extraordinary movement: <em>sankirtana</em>&mdash;the congregational chanting of Krishna&rsquo;s holy names.</p>
  <p> Out of this rich, joyful experience, came an outpouring of cultural expression&mdash;literature; poetry, drama, and song&mdash;which continues to this day.</p>
  <p> Sri Caitanya combined transcendental knowledge, the essence of the ancient Vedic scriptures, with a practical, yet dynamic process for self-realisation: the simple chanting of the Hare Krishna <em>mantra</em>. Over the past thirty years, people from all over the world, have delighted in this un-guessed at solution to the perplexities and dullness of materialistic life.</p>

    <h3>My First Gaura Purnima <br>
    Reflection, by Padma-malini Dasi </h3>
    <p align="center"><span class="verse"><img src="border1.gif" width="200" height="28"></span></p>
    <p>     My first experience of celebrating the appearance of Lord Caitanya had a profound and lasting effect on my life. Although it was almost twelve years ago, I clearly remember how the Hare Krishna <em>mantra</em> touched me and strengthened my faith in the teachings of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Krishna is present in His name and within His name there is unlimited pleasure that we all want but usually run away from. I was fortunate to somehow catch a glimpse of the inner contentment and closeness to God that chanting can bring. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="pm1.jpg" width="275" height="163"></p>
    <p>Half way through my degree course in Belfast I took a year out to focus on my spiritual education. I had spent three years at a reputable university yet wanted more. I wanted to learn about more metaphysical and philosophical topics, and to bring more discipline into my life. I was attracted to Srila Prabhupada&rsquo;s uncomplicated presentation of eastern philosophy and its practical application, and so decided to take time out from university to attend a one year residential course at a local ISKCON temple. </p>
    <p>Life in the temple was different. Rising before 4am daily to attend temple services and engage in meditation and prayer&mdash;how often had I gone to bed at this time as a student! Apart from assisting with various duties in the temple, my day was filled with classes and personal study. Not only was there so much information relating to the tradition but also codes of etiquette and guidelines that covered numerous aspects of life. I learned so much and began to feel energised and cleansed of my short yet intense spurt of student life. </p>
    <p><img src="pm3.jpg" width="227" height="275" class="left">Half way through my course we began to prepare for Gaura Purnima, the celebration of the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. We learned about His life and teachings, and how He introduced the congregational chanting of Hare Krishna. Preparations for the festival started months in advance, ranging from sending invitations to finalising menus. A ten-hour sponsored <em>kirtana </em>was organized to encourage congregational members to chant together for an extended period on this auspicious festival day, as Lord Caitanya had done daily with associates and disciples. </p>
    <p>As a residential student I was fortunate to have the chance to participate in the sponsored <em>kirtana</em>. After a lively and joyful morning service we sat down to chant at 9am . About ten of us began, chanting in response to our <em>kirtana </em>leader, who was an expert singer and musician. Because we were fasting until evening my mind was particularly restless. I had been up since 3am and, having a fierce appetite, was tortured by missing breakfast and the long wait until our evening feast. Nevertheless I sat in the temple room with the others chanting until 3pm . We sang various traditional songs praising the Lord but mostly chanted the Hare Krishna <em>maha-mantra</em>, a prayer asking to be engaged in the Lord&rsquo;s service. My mind was distracted by so many things; my stomach, what others were doing, being uncomfortable sitting for so long, how so-and-so wasn&rsquo;t singing properly or as well as I was, and a million and one other things that can race through your mind in a moment. Despite the continuous restlessness, I kept bringing my mind back to the sound of the <em>mantras </em>and meaning of the prayers. Usually when I get distracted while chanting in <em>kirtana</em> I eventually leave and do something that &lsquo;needs&rsquo; to be done, rather than focusing on the meditation of wanting to serve God. This time it was different. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="pm2.jpg" width="275" height="154"></p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly when it happened, but at some stage in the afternoon my mind seemed to surrender to the chanting. Fifteen of us had gone to the city centre to chant before the Belfast public. When we first began I felt a little self-conscious&mdash;so many stares and strange expressions from passersby. Many people regard Hare Krishna devotees as a queer and crazy bunch, being unable to relate to people who engage in repetitious public chanting despite the lack of interest or the disdain of onlookers. Being aware of the purifying and auspicious effects of chanting, we continued chanting for over two hours. Rather than being concerned or aware of how people were responding to us I found myself focusing more on the Holy Name. My mind was no longer distracted but fresh and alert to the chanting. I didn&rsquo;t even feel hungry! I could feel this huge smile spreading over my face and imagined people must have thought I was mad. I could see everyone rushing by, busy trying to do what they had to do, and felt privileged to know that simply by focusing on God&rsquo;s name I could connect with an inner peace that others seemed to miss being too busy with life. By the time we returned to the temple I was so thankful to continue chanting with other devotees who had arrived for the evening festival celebrations. </p>
    <p>Lord Caitanya emphasised the importance of chanting God&rsquo;s names and how they can purify our minds and hearts. He explains how the name of Krishna is not different from Him and how we can develop love for God by continually repeating His names in a mood of humility and tolerance. By absorbing myself in the chanting I personally experienced the truth of His teachings: I felt a closeness and connection to God that I had never felt before. As we continued chanting I became aware of an overwhelming sense of appreciation for Srila Prabhupada and Lord Caitanya, how grateful I was that they had attempted to reach out to me to tell me about Krishna and how to connect with Him. Not only appreciation but possibly the closest I have come to feeling love&mdash;a sense of wanting to do whatever they wanted me to do as a sign of my appreciation, wanting to please and surrender my life to them. With this came an amazing sense of joy and enthusiasm, rooted in the understanding of the truth of their teachings&mdash;chanting Hare Krishna is the most powerful means to connect with God. And once you can come in contact with God all needs and desires are automatically fulfilled. </p>
    <p>For days after the festival I felt like I was floating, nothing could bother me and I was so eager to share what had happened with others. Did they realize how powerful chanting is, and why were they bothering with all the useless attempts to satisfy themselves? I had experienced the intense pleasure and contentment that comes from surrendering to hearing Krishna &rsquo;s name and understood that nothing could compare to this. </p>
    <p>Although I have not applied myself in the same way since then nor experienced such concentrated emotion, I have not forgotten the power of the Hare Krishna mantra. Years later I continue to chant on beads daily and regularly take part in <em>kirtana</em>, knowing how potent this form of meditation is. I look forward to festival days when I can give more time and attention for chanting and hearing than my usual schedule allows. I fantasise about retiring to a life of uninterrupted chanting in my old age and want to mould my life in such a way that this can become a reality. Despite continually getting caught up in the needs and distractions of my life, I try to reprioritise the role of chanting in my life and appreciate spending time with others who share this desire. It is easy to chant and chanting is the easiest way to become truly peaceful and satisfied&mdash;thanks to my first Gaura Purnima experience I will never forget this. </p>
