  <h3>What is Siksastakam?</h3>
  <p>Eight verses written by Lord Caitanya that succinctly capture Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy and practice. </p>
  <h3>Who is Lord Caitanya? </h3>
  <p> Discovering <img src="gaura5.jpg" width="75" height="123" class="right">Sri Caitanya, his personality, and teachings, has been a surprising revelation to many outside India over the last few decades. Thoughtful people, those concerned with the plight of our world, seekers of truth and a spiritual path, and people simply looking for personal happiness, have been surprised to discover such profound and vital truth in such an unexpected place. After all, who has heard of Lord Caitanya!</p>
  <p> Yet, for 500 years Lord Caitanya has been acknowledged as the spiritual leader for our age by many of India&rsquo;s most respected philosophers.</p>
  <p> In the fifteenth century, Sri Caitanya created a spiritual revolution in India , attracting followers from all levels of society. Kings, government ministers, scholars, poets, people of all religions and people of none, the rich, the poor, all were moved to take part in his extraordinary movement: <em>sankirtana</em>&mdash;the congregational chanting of Krishna&rsquo;s holy names.</p>
  <p> Out of this rich, joyful experience, came an outpouring of cultural expression&mdash;literature; poetry, drama, and song&mdash;which continues to this day.</p>
  <p> Sri Caitanya combined transcendental knowledge, the essence of the ancient Vedic scriptures, with a practical, yet dynamic process for self-realisation: the simple chanting of the Hare Krishna <em>mantra</em>. Over the past thirty years, people from all over the world, have delighted in this un-guessed at solution to the perplexities and dullness of materialistic life.</p>

    <h3>Sri Siksastakam Verse One<br>
      Reflections, by Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami </h3>
    <p>  <strong>These &ldquo;supremely valuable prayers&rdquo;</strong> are the only verses left by Lord Caitanya. He assigned the writing of His doctrine to His disciples, especially the Goswamis of Vrindavana&mdash;Rupa, Sanatana, and Jiva. But the eight verses, Siksastaka, reveal the entire mission and teachings of Lord Caitanya.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="sdg1.jpg" width="360" height="150"> </p>
    <p>Lord Caitanya begins, &ldquo;All glories to the chanting of Hare Krishna!&rdquo; <em>param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam</em>. This first verse of Siksastaka states several reasons why <em>sankirtana </em>(congregational chanting of the holy names) should be glorified. The first reason is because it cleanses the heart of all the dust that&rsquo;s been there for many years. This refers to an internal cleansing process. If we neglect to clean a room, soon dust will appear on the furniture and under the bed. But the dirt that the chanting of Hare Krishna cleans is the dirt of material desires within the heart. Whenever we desire something and forget the pleasure of Krishna , the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; desire. Otherwise, nothing is innately good or bad. But if we desire anything other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is inauspicious.</p>
    <p> Lord Caitanya has composed His verse with many poetic metaphors. The dirt that gathers within is like dust on a mirror. If we look into a dusty mirror, we cannot see our face. Similarly, we cannot see our original self because of the dirty covering on the mirror of the mind. We cannot see our spiritual self. And unless we take action to clean this inner mirror, then our whole life will be in forgetfulness of God and our relationship to Him. We will continue to think that we are this body. We will think that we are a man or a woman, or that we are born in a particular country and so on. We will try to seek our happiness in terms of the body. But the body can not give us happiness, and therefore we remain in ignorance, trying to be happy. But if we can discover the spiritual self, then we will be happy.</p>
    <p> <img src="sdg2.jpg" width="120" height="213" class="left">The real self is comparable to a piece of valuable gold, which is covered by a lump of dirt. Unless we wash away the dirt, we cannot enjoy the benefit of the original gold. So the chanting removes all the dirty coverings and reveals our original spiritual nature. That nature is full of bliss and eternity, and exists in a loving relationship with Lord Krishna.</p>
    <p> Lord Caitanya also says that the chanting puts out a fire, <em>maha-davagni</em>. There is a large fire, like a forest fire, raging within us. This is the fire of birth and death. When we die, due to the dirty things in the heart, we have to take another material body. This process of dying and being born again is very painful to the living entity. We try to forget it, but actually we are always in anxiety, especially about our oncoming death. And according to Vedic knowledge, we do not only die once but our desires lead us to take bodies over and over again. When we chant Hare Krishna, we can sometimes think of these metaphors that Lord Caitanya has used. It is true that our heart is being cleaned of dirt. And the chanting produces a very nice rain, which is putting out the fire of birth and death. Thus Lord Chaitanya praises the chanting, not in sentimental terms, but based on the actual work that the holy name produces on the conditioned soul. It cleans the dirt, it brings the downpour of rain &ndash; and it is a blessing.</p>
    <p> Lord Caitanya says that the chanting of Hare Krishna is the best blessing, because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. This refers to the phenomenon of the waxing moon. At the beginning of a fortnight, the moon starts very small and grows gradually to a full moon. Spiritual progress is like that. You begin from a little bit and it grows and grows as long as you practice.</p>
    <p> The waxing moon of spiritual life is not only one person&rsquo;s private concern. When the chanting is widely distributed, then the blessings go to everyone. Just as the blessing of the moon is appreciated by everyone in the world, so the chanting of Hare Krishna can spread in the same way. Therefore, sometimes a great <em>acarya </em>[teacher] is compared to the moon because he spreads the holy name all over the world.</p>
    <p> Lord Caitanya finally says that by chanting Hare Krishna, you get a taste for the nectar for which we are always anxious. He is well aware that we are always looking for pleasure. Commercial advertisers are also aware everyone is seeking pleasure and so they play upon this desire, claiming &ldquo;we have the taste&rdquo;, &ldquo;the taste is here&rdquo;. But the tiny taste which sense-gratification can give by stimulating the tongue, or the belly, or the genitals, or the ears, is not satisfying to the real self. The pleasure that the soul experiences is many times greater than any other pleasure. It is the nectar for which we are always anxious.</p>
